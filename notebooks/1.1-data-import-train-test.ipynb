so it 's some sort of taxonomic uh , ordering of of the of the units . now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses , uh you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used , and uh , i think that 's a that 's a very that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and uh as a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , science , biology , and then but that 's really all that we have at the moment . so i think there 's a huge , um , uh need for improvement there . now , what this uh a standard like this would give us is we could um , sort of uh with a search engine just query uh , different repositories all over the world . but we ca n't really um , so what i 'm what i try to do is um , to have um , uh so . so the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . now , what what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh , students um , try to u program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same problems , uh , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and so , what i want to build is basically a a smart f a q system . now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than `` i 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . `` so . and i think that i do n't need to tell you this . i 'm i 'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , uh , context it , and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . so , i want to be able to model information like , um , so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , um , what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's um , which um , which error message was encountered . so this sort of information i think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved . now , um , basically giving this um uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically , and that 's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again . and , using this and some some uh , knowledge about the domain i think you can do some some simple inferences . like you know that when somebody 's working about uh , working on on servlets for example , he 's using java , cuz servlets are used are written in java . so some some inferences like that , now , um , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of um off the documents you 're you 're searching against . so , uh what i wan na do is basically have some sort of um given these inputs , and then i can compute how many documents match , and use this as a metric in the search . now , what i plan to do is i want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results , and i want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um steepest descent approach . so if i knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? and and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this i could simply compute that , and find out which um which questions are worth um , asking . and that 's what i then propagate back to the user , and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . now , the big problem that i 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . and uh uh , so robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a bayesian network , which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . and so , uh what i 'm what i try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine uh , knowledge from very different sources , and and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with . trying to to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , um , what you can do with those . um . what i 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh , computational model . that that probably is n't expressive enough . so . so that 's another thing , um , which i think you 're also uh , uh looking into right now . and then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it it uses , or basically its view of the world , uh you can get very different results . so it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines . and there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach , where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , rather than going to some yahoo - like uh , search engine . so these are some of the just in a nutshell , some of the ideas . and i think a lot of the even though it 's a it 's a very different domain , but i think a lot of the , um , issues are are fairly similar . so . ok .\",\n",
