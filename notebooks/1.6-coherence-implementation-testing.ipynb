      "['controversy', 'tourists', 'traditions', 'thriving'] The discovery of the cemetery and the Lovers of Sumpa particularly brought significant amount of media attention to Ecuador which in turn helped emphasize the importance of archaeological research to the understanding of heritage and culture The Lovers of Sumpa have even been called the Romeo and Juliet of Ecuador and for this reason have served as great source of information for sculptors poets and musicians all over the world In general this kind of attention has been beneficial for Ecuador drawing tourists and doubling the Santa Elena population in 20 years During these same 20 years there was some controversy and drama about what would happen to the site and the remains Increased oil prices prevented the country from supplying enough funds to the project to do anything beneficial other than provide guards to protect the important cultural site Despite the lack of funds for so long eventually the team was able to secure the site in way that is safe for the artifacts as well as being beneficial to the cultural knowledge of the people This effect is arguably the most significant consequence of the discovery of this site Modernization of Ecuador has drawn the rural people away from their lands and their traditions but this discovery which prompted an amazing museum as well as cultural and heritage additions to the curriculum of Santa Elena students ensures the survival of the rich culture of this once thriving people The Las Vegas people customs are being preserved\n",
