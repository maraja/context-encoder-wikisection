0,0,but i 'm not sure i totally understand everything that 's being talked about,15,0.5,0.10030259191989899
0,0,like so so it 's just based on like the materials you had about heidelberg .,15,0.5,0.19473260641098022
0,0,um are you familiar with with the with the very rough setup of the data ?,15,0.5,0.0901133120059967
0,0,but i i imagine i 'll c just catch on .,15,0.5,0.07121829688549042
0,0,"based on the web site , yeah , at the",15,0.5,0.15431340038776398
0,0,oh ok there 's a web site,15,0.5,0.07124175876379013

0,0,"it 's a tourist information web site ,",15,0.5,0.08557082712650299
0,0,"uh , this is where they 're supposed to",15,0.5,0.05073331296443939
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.12230627983808517
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08538848161697388
0,0,talk to a machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on .,15,0.5,0.07776136696338654
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09208135306835175
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.18036049604415894
0,0,the question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task .,15,0.5,0.15093424916267395
0,0,ok . ok . ok .,15,0.5,0.0907958447933197
0,0,"because what will happen then is that people repeat repeat , { comment } or as much as they can , of that phrasing .",15,0.5,0.11019642651081085
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.0688859075307846
0,0,"hmm . um , are you worried about being able to identify",15,0.5,0.11492684483528137
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12653033435344696
0,0,um . the the goals that we 've d you guys have been talking about are this these you know identifying which of three modes um their question uh concerns .,15,0.5,0.07461212575435638
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14241527020931244
0,0,so it 's like the enter versus view,15,0.5,0.16246116161346436
0,0,"yeah , we we we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction ,",15,0.5,0.13293342292308807
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.09983333945274353
0,0,"right ? that 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things",15,0.5,0.19930428266525269
0,0,uh - huh . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13588012754917145
0,0,"and so th the q first question for the subject is , `` so these are things , you know , we thought a tourist can do . is there anything that interests you ? ``",15,0.5,0.1457940936088562
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11713726818561554
0,0,"and the person can say `` yeah , sure sh this is something i would do . i would go shopping `` . yeah ? and then we can sort of this s instructor can say `` well , uh then you you may want to find out how to get over here",15,0.5,0.14168207347393036
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1316397786140442
0,0,because this is where the shopping district is `` .,15,0.5,0.14205794036388397
0,0,so the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session ?,15,0.5,0.14937935769557953
0,0,"no . just sort of ok , what what what would you like to buy and then um ok there you wan na buy a whatever cuckoos clocks",15,0.5,0.07770415395498276
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.0916094109416008
0,0,ok and the there is a store there .,15,0.5,0.09596695750951767
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.15883587300777435
0,0,"so the task then for that person is t finding out how to get there , right ?",15,0.5,0.11866655200719833
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10886531323194504
0,0,that 's sort of what 's left .,15,0.5,0.11006683111190796
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13236483931541443
0,0,and we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person wants to buy a cuckoos clock .,15,0.5,0.17455096542835236
0,0,"ok , that 's what i mean so like those tasks are all gon na be um unambiguous about which of the three modes .",15,0.5,0.09070191532373428
0,0,hopefully .,15,0.5,0.07331806421279907
0,0,right . ok . so .,15,0.5,0.08671996742486954
0,0,"well , so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words .",15,0.5,0.07564535737037659
0,0,hopefully .,15,0.5,0.08646537363529205
0,0,t that they 'll be here ?,15,0.5,0.0653788298368454
0,0,"yes . in a sense that 's exactly the the the idea ,",15,0.5,0.05842408910393715
0,0,uh uh,15,0.5,0.11021663248538971
0,0,"which is never possible in a in a s in a lab situation ,",15,0.5,0.14898371696472168
0,0,"well , u u the one experiment th that that that i 've read somewhere , it was they u used pictures .",15,0.5,0.16098318994045258
0,0,nuh ?,15,0.5,0.1634129285812378
0,0,so to to uh actually um uh specify the the tasks .,15,0.5,0.10544024407863617
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.062072303146123886
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13310429453849792
0,0,"uh , but you know i i",15,0.5,0.10630263388156891
0,0,"yeah . we had exactly that on our list of possible way things so we uh i even made a sort of a silly thing how that could work , how you control you are here you you want to know how to get someplace , and this is the place and it 's a museum and you want to do some and and and there 's a person looking at pictures . so , you know , this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at pictures .",15,0.5,0.1453125774860382
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.06767987459897995
0,0,"however , not only was the common census were among all participants of friday 's meeting was it 's gon na be very laborious to to make these drawings for each different things ,",15,0.5,0.07388371974229813
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.14452490210533142
0,0,"all the different actions , if at all possible , and also people will get caught up in the pictures . so all of a sudden we 'll get descriptions of pictures in there .",15,0.5,0.13177557289600372
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.0927630066871643
0,0,and people talking about pictures and pictorial representations,15,0.5,0.07218635827302933
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.13485652208328247
0,0,and um,15,0.5,0.11899293959140778
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10478613525629044
0,0,i would s i would still be willing to try it .,15,0.5,0.12738826870918274
0,0,"i mean , i i 'm i 'm not saying it 's necessary but but uh i uh uh i you might be able to combine you know text uh and and some sort of picture and also uh i think it it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task and then take the test away the the the the the text away",15,0.5,0.07229875028133392
0,0,mm - hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.12282592803239822
0,0,"so that they are not uh guided by by by what you wrote ,",15,0.5,0.11474243551492691
0,0,we will,15,0.5,0.09670931845903397
0,0,but can come up with their with their own,15,0.5,0.11607229709625244
0,1,"ok , disk backup , et cetera ? um i spoke with dave johnson about putting all the meeting recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and he pretty much said `` yeah , you could do that if you want `` but he thought it was a bad idea . in fact what he said is doing the manual one , { comment } doing uh nw archive to copy it { comment } is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . he w he 's a firm believer in in lots of different modalities of backup . i mean , his point was well taken . this data can not be recovered .",15,0.5,0.09194203466176987
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10403028130531311
0,0,and so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup .,15,0.5,0.1569894552230835
0,0,well i guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gon na if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gon na burden things in the incremental backups .,15,0.5,0.1976643055677414
0,0,just just the monthly full .,15,0.5,0.07291705906391144
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.10599682480096817
0,0,"yeah , so the monthly full will be a bear but",15,0.5,0.14656351506710052
0,0,"yeah . but he said that that we sh should n't worry too much about that , that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably ok .",15,0.5,0.11890164017677307
0,0,really ?,15,0.5,0.10548277944326401
0,0,"and uh , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh recording meetings .",15,0.5,0.09597282856702805
0,0,"so i guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ?",15,0.5,0.09080945700407028
0,0,"things that are recreatable easily and also yeah , basically things that are recreatable .",15,0.5,0.12965622544288635
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.16433285176753998
0,0,the expanded files and things like that .,15,0.5,0.14035823941230774
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07411577552556992
0,0,they take up a lot more room anyway .,15,0.5,0.07597866654396057
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10272916406393051
0,0,uh but we do need more disk .,15,0.5,0.08685549348592758
0,0,so we can get more disk . yeah . so .,15,0.5,0.08652296662330627
0,0,yeah . and i i think i agree with him . i mean his point was well taken that if we lose one of these we can not get it back .,15,0.5,0.07645553350448608
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09149251133203506
0,0,i do n't think there was any other et cetera there .,15,0.5,0.07940994948148727
0,0,well i was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had uh,15,0.5,0.12439252436161041
0,0,i thought you guys were gon na burn c ds ?,15,0.5,0.1721545308828354
0,0,um unfortunately we could burn c ds but first of all it 's a pain .,15,0.5,0.055055513978004456
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.07905175536870956
0,0,because you have to copy it down to the pc and then burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure . and second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press do n't last .,15,0.5,0.06683824211359024
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14224180579185486
0,0,so i think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea .,15,0.5,0.11153873056173325
0,0,i see . ok .,15,0.5,0.11893323063850403
0,0,cuz th they they fail after a couple years .,15,0.5,0.1356600522994995
0,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.0788121372461319
0,0,"i do have uh uh it 's a different topic . can i add one top topic ? we have time ? i wanted to ask , i know that uh that thilo you were , um , bringing the channeltrans interface onto the windows machine ? and i wanted to know is th",15,0.5,0.13470806181430817
0,0,"yeah it 's it basically it 's done ,",15,0.5,0.1044653058052063
0,0,it 's all done ? that 's g wonderful . great .,15,0.5,0.09448593109846115
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.1080668494105339
0,0,"yes , since tcl - tk runs on it , basically things 'll just work .",15,0.5,0.13775211572647095
0,0,"yeah it yeah , it was just a problem with the snack version and the transcriber version but it 's solved .",15,0.5,0.14717790484428406
0,0,"does and that does that mean , i",15,0.5,0.07544905692338943
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.08584821969270706
0,0,maybe i should know this but i do n't . does this mean that the that this could be por uh ported to a think - pad note or some other type of uh,15,0.5,0.07713177800178528
0,0,"yeah , basically uh i did install it on my laptop and yeah",15,0.5,0.11304960399866104
0,0,wonderful .,15,0.5,0.12547844648361206

0,0,hmm ! good . crosspads ? crosspads ?,15,0.5,0.08456561714410782
0,0,"uh got an email from uh james landay who basically said `` if you 're not using them , could you return them ? `` so he said he does n't need them , he just periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them and asks them if they 're still using them .",15,0.5,0.11340652406215668
0,0,so we 've never used them .,15,0.5,0.10799422860145569

0,0,but,15,0.5,0.12463346868753433
0,0,"my opinion on it is , first , i never take notes anyway so i 'm not gon na use it , um and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with .",15,0.5,0.13593536615371704
0,0,"and i have uh so my my feeling on it is that i think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . on the other hand , i the down side for me was that i think the pen is really noisy . so you have ka kaplunk , kaplunk , kaplunk . and i and i do n't know if it 's audible on the but i i sort of thought that was a disadvantage . i do take notes , i mean , i could be taking notes on these things and i guess the plus with the crosspads would be the time markings but i do n't know .",15,0.5,0.07635729759931564
0,0,"uh , what is a crosspad ?",15,0.5,0.07919786125421524

0,0,"not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? and um i think that was one of the things ,",15,0.5,0.11270718276500702
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.07473910599946976
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12609915435314178
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.13369645178318024
0,0,"right ? and so the it seemed like a neat idea . we 'll have a you know , have a scribe , have somebody uh take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . and then we did it once or twice and we sort of",15,0.5,0.24312923848628998
0,0,"yep , and then just sort of died out .",15,0.5,0.09352130442857742
0,0,probably chose the wrong scribe but it was it 's uh,15,0.5,0.14773601293563843
0,0,i mean,15,0.5,0.09702517837285995
0,0,yeah that 's right .,15,0.5,0.1229160726070404
0,0,well i did it one time,15,0.5,0.14685103297233582
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.07818767428398132
0,0,but um,15,0.5,0.1365726739168167
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14856888353824615
0,0,"u but i guess the the other thing i 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing i wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface .",15,0.5,0.180967777967453
0,0,"i mean we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ?",15,0.5,0.11016548424959183
0,0,"oh it 's la it 's useful ,",15,0.5,0.07938064634799957
0,0,because that 's summary .,15,0.5,0.09133587032556534
0,0,have a summary and high points .,15,0.5,0.11235873401165009
0,0,summary .,15,0.5,0.15964367985725403
0,0,i think there 's also there 's this use that,15,0.5,0.18255656957626343
0,0,summarize it from the transcription .,15,0.5,0.16834929585456848
0,0,"the well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wan na make an x and you do n't wan na take notes and you 're you just wan na",15,0.5,0.07687748968601227
0,0,doodle .,15,0.5,0.13182735443115234
0,0,"get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you know , and and then while you 're bored you do n't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a x and { comment } but in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . also with i was thinking and i know morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wan na let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wan na distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an x near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . so . i know we have n't been using it but i w i can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods",15,0.5,0.11536425352096558
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08547288924455643
0,0,which you then get back in a transcript,15,0.5,0.12776798009872437
0,0,well .,15,0.5,0.10057133436203003
0,0,"i guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later",15,0.5,0.14121517539024353
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.11632663756608963
0,0,"and and and put some kind of summary or something uh you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . but then you do n't you do n't have the time reference uh that you 'd have if you had it live .",15,0.5,0.1359281837940216
0,0,"right . and you do n't have a lot of other cues that might be useful ,",15,0.5,0.11498966068029404
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1602245271205902
0,0,how do you synchronize the time in the crosspad and the time of the recording ?,15,0.5,0.1247544214129448
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.10148537158966064
0,0,i mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the crosspads and so that means synchronizing the time,15,0.5,0.07931679487228394
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.0974557027220726
0,0,you know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery,15,0.5,0.11248601973056793
0,0,well when when i d,15,0.5,0.11887902021408081
0,0,and so you,15,0.5,0.09099553525447845
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.11033409833908081
0,0,"so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wan na do anything with this information .",15,0.5,0.14102528989315033
0,0,w mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.07290690392255783
0,0,why,15,0.5,0.09599000960588455
0,0,and so there 's a lot of infrastructure which,15,0.5,0.08600420504808426
0,0,there is an alternative .,15,0.5,0.1214754581451416
0,0,unless someone,15,0.5,0.09792523086071014
0,0,"there is an alternative , i mean , it 's still , there 's uh you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but it does n't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . you c i mean , i when i when i did it i synchronized it by voice , by whispering `` one , two , three , four `` onto the microphone",15,0.5,0.12235945463180542
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.10365800559520721
0,0,"and uh , you know .",15,0.5,0.090053029358387
0,0,"well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end",15,0.5,0.0748290866613388
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10443055629730225
0,0,"which someone has to listen to that and find that point ,",15,0.5,0.0993417426943779
0,0,"yeah , it 's transcribed . it 's in the transcript .",15,0.5,0.1502058058977127
0,0,and then mark it .,15,0.5,0.07417970150709152
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10110471397638321
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.13359281420707703
0,0,well it 's in the transcript .,15,0.5,0.11906316876411438
0,0,"well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? would h i mean is there a big cau",15,0.5,0.11953967809677124
0,0,we can keep all both of them for the whole whole year .,15,0.5,0.16733090579509735
0,0,just just in case we,15,0.5,0.08678452670574188
0,0,"i mean , it 's just",15,0.5,0.08774685859680176
0,0,even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate uh f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but i it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out .,15,0.5,0.14564113318920135
0,0,"well one thing that we might try um is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe edu is the right one or maybe something else , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . i mean ,",15,0.5,0.09701403975486755
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08113650977611542
0,0,uh part of the reason i think part of the reason that adam was so interested in uh the speechcorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and,15,0.5,0.1395745873451233
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.11947470903396606
0,0,"and so forth so and and jane is more into it but eh uh you know i do n't know if you wan na really do do this all the time so i think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . um and if so , it 's probably worth having one . the p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to um uh routinely use it , i mean it just has n't happened anyway . but maybe if we can get a person to",15,0.5,0.19355683028697968
0,0,"yeah i do n't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wan na make a note of , like what jane was talking about with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute .",15,0.5,0.1025073453783989
0,0,well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a pda with a wireless card . and and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the linux server and uh,15,0.5,0.14609909057617188
0,0,so what kind of input would you be ?,15,0.5,0.1179274246096611
0,0,"so so , i mean , if you 're not worried about",15,0.5,0.14309392869472504
0,0,buttons .,15,0.5,0.09874618053436279
0,0,you 'd just be pressing like a a,15,0.5,0.10016142576932907
0,0,"well well you have a pda and may and you could have the same sort of x interface or whatever , i mean , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it .",15,0.5,0.09947805106639862
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.0890631452202797

0,0,"yeah , that be good .",15,0.5,0.1414247304201126
0,0,"i mean , if if all you really wanted was you did n't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a pda with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go . i mean even buttons you could do , sort of , i mean , as you said .",15,0.5,0.1627446711063385
0,0,"i mean for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else ,",15,0.5,0.08458955585956573

0,0,"i mean , i do n't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but i 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and",15,0.5,0.13501562178134918
0,0,i like this pda idea . yeah .,15,0.5,0.08755219727754593
0,0,"yeah , i do like the idea of having a couple buttons",15,0.5,0.05761318653821945
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.108158178627491

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12566561996936798
0,0,where like one one button was `` uh - oh `` and then another button was `` that 's great `` and another button `` that 's f ``,15,0.5,0.13738523423671722

0,0,and then,15,0.5,0.08835400640964508
0,0,i mean i think the crosspad idea is a good one .,15,0.5,0.07985784858465195
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.12617427110671997
0,0,it 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work . i mean that 's part of the reason why it has n't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me,15,0.5,0.1725175529718399

0,0,w,15,0.5,0.07145320624113083
0,0,does n't it ? i mean,15,0.5,0.13381898403167725
0,0,well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard .,15,0.5,0.1332150399684906
0,0,"but i mean , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it ca n't do handwriting recognition , right ?",15,0.5,0.09560836106538773
0,0,"no , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information ,",15,0.5,0.12328222393989563

0,0,it 's all digital .,15,0.5,0.10396283119916916
0,0,i i guess what i 'm thinking is that the pda solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a i mean,15,0.5,0.12036129087209702

0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.13935358822345734
0,0,"well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their p d as to the meeting eventually , right ? that 's why we have this little i do n't know what i do n't wan na cause more work for anyone but i can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and so if we do n't have to return it and we can keep it for a year i do n't know .",15,0.5,0.14528483152389526

0,0,"i mean , th the reason i like p - file is i 'm already familiar with it , we have expertise here , and so if we pick something else , there 's the learning - curve problem . but , i mean , it is just something we developed at icsi .",15,0.5,0.17791962623596191
0,0,is there an is there an ip - api ?,15,0.5,0.09123838692903519
0,0,and so yeah .,15,0.5,0.07231554388999939
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1065838634967804
0,0,"there 's an api for it . and , uh ,",15,0.5,0.08888307958841324

0,0,"a bunch of libraries , p - file utilities .",15,0.5,0.11261356621980667

0,0,"well , that 's gon na be a problem no matter what . you have the two - gigabyte limit on the filesystem size . and we definitely hit that with broadcast news .",15,0.5,0.17112797498703003
0,0,"maybe you could extend the api to , uh , support , uh , like splitting up , you know , conceptually one file into smaller files on disk so that you can essentially , you know , have arbitrarily long f",15,0.5,0.10404254496097565
0,0,yep . most of the tools can handle that .,15,0.5,0.06103727966547012
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13750284910202026
0,0,so that we did n't do it at the api - level . we did it at the t tool - level . that that most many of them can s you can specify several p - files and they 'll just be done sequentially .,15,0.5,0.10822752863168716

0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.11000362783670425

0,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.18276800215244293

0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.0950154960155487
0,0,it 's like the history of icsi .,15,0.5,0.12390241771936417
0,0,you worked with p - files .,15,0.5,0.09486942738294601
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12872619926929474
0,0,like,15,0.5,0.11171359568834305
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.11600328981876373
0,0,i worked with p - files .,15,0.5,0.09009434282779694

0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.18258151412010193

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12634140253067017
0,0,so it works pretty well .,15,0.5,0.148145392537117
0,0,"and that is n't really , i guess , as important as the the main i do n't know what you call it , the the main sort of word - level",15,0.5,0.10994959622621536
0,0,neither do i .,15,0.5,0.08334123343229294

0,0,it 's a phil file ?,15,0.5,0.11095869541168213
0,0,yeah . that 's my guess .,15,0.5,0.10615214705467224
0,0,"huh . ok . well , that 's really useful . i mean , this is exactly the kind of thing that i wanted to settle . um , so",15,0.5,0.16819657385349274
0,0,"yeah , i 've been meaning to look at the atlas stuff again anyway .",15,0.5,0.12665018439292908
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.11182661354541779
0,0,"so , just keep",15,0.5,0.08659043908119202
0,0,"yeah . i guess it 's also sort of a political deci i mean , if if you feel like that 's a community that would be good to tie into anyway , then it 's sounds like it 's worth doing .",15,0.5,0.0748627632856369
0,0,"yeah , i think it it w",15,0.5,0.13915377855300903
0,0,j i think there 's,15,0.5,0.14530298113822937
0,0,"and , w uh , as i said , i what i did with this stuff i based it on theirs . it 's just they had n't actually come up with an external format yet . so now that they have come up with a format , it does n't it seems pretty reasonable to use it .",15,0.5,0.14932028949260712
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.11758344620466232

0,0,"ok , great .",15,0.5,0.09516596049070358
0,0,"as i said , that",15,0.5,0.10971228033304214
0,0,cuz we actually can start,15,0.5,0.183237686753273
0,0,there 's one level there 's one more level of indirection and i 'm just blanking on exactly how it works . i got ta look at it again .,15,0.5,0.15233980119228363
0,0,"i mean , we can start with , um , i guess , this input from dave 's , which you had printed out , the channelized input . cuz he has all of the channels , you know , with the channels in the tag and stuff like that .",15,0.5,0.07263001054525375
0,0,"yeah , i 've seen it .",15,0.5,0.1573435515165329
0,0,"so that would be i directly ,",15,0.5,0.14475493133068085
0,1,"but i 'm i 'm just wondering if um on the list of things that there are to do , if there are things that we wo n't do because we 've got two groups doing the same thing .",15,0.5,0.11850445717573166
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1334283947944641

0,0,"yeah , well ,",15,0.5,0.11043521761894226
0,0,there also could be i mean . i can maybe see a reason f for both working on it too,15,0.5,0.10359007120132446
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.04850637540221214
0,0,"if um you know , if if if you work on something else and and you 're waiting for them to give you spectral subtraction i mean it 's hard to know whether the effects that you get from the other experiments you do will carry over once you then bring in their spectral subtraction module . so it 's it 's almost like everything 's held up waiting for this one thing . i do n't know if that 's true or not , but i could see how",15,0.5,0.09238231182098389

0,0,i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.11095954477787018
0,0,maybe that 's what you were thinking .,15,0.5,0.07463837414979935
0,0,"i do n't know . i mean , we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which which is n't quite what you 'd like it to be . that that seems like one prominent thing . and then uh were n't issues of of having a a second stream or something ? that was was it there was this business that , you know , we we could use up the full forty - eight hundred bits , and",15,0.5,0.07436339557170868

0,0,um . so .,15,0.5,0.13227994740009308
0,0,ok . do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be ? the next uh,15,0.5,0.11131296306848526
0,0,it 's uh in june .,15,0.5,0.12121273577213287

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1271003931760788
0,0,"yeah . um . yeah , the other thing is that you saw that that mail about uh the vad v a ds performing quite differently ? that that uh so um . this there was this experiment of uh `` what if we just take the baseline ? ``",15,0.5,0.11186327040195465

0,0,"set uh of features , just mel cepstra , and you inc incorporate the different v a and it looks like the the french vad is actually uh better significantly better .",15,0.5,0.08692529797554016
0,0,improves the baseline ?,15,0.5,0.11978805065155029
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.11911126226186752
0,0,yeah but i do n't know which vad they use . uh . if the use the small vad i th i think it 's on i think it 's easy to do better because it does n't work at all . so . i i do n't know which which one . it 's pratibha that that did this experiment .,15,0.5,0.09599044919013977
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.19749405980110168
0,0,um . we should ask which vad she used .,15,0.5,0.0978744849562645
0,0,"i do n't @ @ . he actually , i think that he say with the good vad of from ogi and with the alcatel vad . and the experiment was sometime better , sometime worse .",15,0.5,0.1408282220363617
0,0,yeah but i it 's uh i think you were talking about the other mail that used vad on the reference features .,15,0.5,0.14904606342315674
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.10347943753004074
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11611621826887131
0,0,"and on that one , uh the french one is was better .",15,0.5,0.10593629628419876
0,0,i do n't remember .,15,0.5,0.09663327038288116
0,0,it was just better .,15,0.5,0.0812036544084549
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12326990813016891
0,0,"i mean it was enough better that that it would uh account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance , actually .",15,0.5,0.10097995400428772
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09361276775598526
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13993187248706818
0,0,"so . uh . so if they have a better one , we should use it . i mean . you know ? it 's you ca n't work on everything .",15,0.5,0.08158177882432938
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09148896485567093
0,0,uh . uh . yeah .,15,0.5,0.09900891780853271

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10290990769863129
0,0,and perhaps we can easily improve if if we put like mean normalization before the before the vad . because as as you 've mentioned .,15,0.5,0.072074294090271
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.17550401389598846

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10596273094415665
0,0,also is stephane was thinking that maybe it was useful to f to think about uh voiced - unvoiced,15,0.5,0.08091786503791809
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14982351660728455

0,0,"yeah , my feeling is that um actually when we look at all the proposals , ev everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope",15,0.5,0.10792077332735062
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.0983739122748375
0,0,and um it 's,15,0.5,0.09480711072683334
0,0,no use of pitch uh basically . yeah .,15,0.5,0.07813210040330887
0,0,"yeah , well , not pitch , but to look at the um fine at the at the high re high resolution spectrum .",15,0.5,0.1425834447145462
0,0,"yeah . well , it",15,0.5,0.11443757265806198
0,0,"so . we do n't necessarily want to find the the pitch of the of the sound but uh cuz i have a feeling that when we look when we look at the just at the envelope there is no way you can tell if it 's voiced and unvoiced , if there is some it 's it 's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency and . so there would be more ,",15,0.5,0.07250496745109558

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.1060619130730629

0,0,"uh , i was just gon na say is n't there are n't are n't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity , or speech - nonspeech rather , { comment } um by looking at um , you know , uh i guess harmonics or looking across time",15,0.5,0.10459109395742416
0,0,"well , i think he was talking about the voiced - unvoiced , though ,",15,0.5,0.09961862117052078

0,0,yeah . well even with e,15,0.5,0.0660964623093605

0,0,um i thought that you or somebody was talking about,15,0.5,0.133599191904068
0,0,"well . uh yeah . b we should let him finish what he w he was gon na say ,",15,0.5,0.0770699679851532

0,0,so go ahead .,15,0.5,0.0927557572722435
0,0,"um yeah , so yeah , i think if we try to develop a second stream well , there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second , it could be interesting to have that 's something that 's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum . and . yeah , so i do n't know . we were thinking about like using ideas from from larry saul , have a good voice detector , have a good , well , voiced - speech detector , that 's working on on the fft and uh",15,0.5,0.10550608485937119

0,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.10786731541156769
0,0,so what he was doing is basically y you you do estimate the pitch .,15,0.5,0.06670858711004257

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.12360357493162155

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1994754672050476
0,0,then that would that would i guess be uh a reasonable use of independent information . so maybe that 's what you meant . and then that would be,15,0.5,0.13553419709205627
0,0,"yeah , well , i was not thinking this yeah , this could be an yeah so you mean have some kind of probability for the v the voicing",15,0.5,0.17587968707084656
0,0,r right . so you have a second neural net .,15,0.5,0.14447079598903656
0,0,and then use a tandem system,15,0.5,0.09105543792247772

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12692949175834656
0,0,"and we 'll get the summary like , this the c you know , short version , like",15,0.5,0.1196250468492508
0,0,an - and i would like to second keith 's request .,15,0.5,0.09439167380332947
0,0,s,15,0.5,0.16478240489959717
0,0,an example wo would be nice t to have kind of a detailed example .,15,0.5,0.22340816259384155
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.0658290758728981
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13952817022800446
0,0,yes . i 've i 've i 've i guess i 'm on record for promising that now .,15,0.5,0.09987720102071762
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08710848540067673
0,0,so um,15,0.5,0.08589867502450943
0,0,"like have it we 'll have it in writing . so . or , better , speech . so .",15,0.5,0.08915454149246216
0,0,this is it and um,15,0.5,0.08141966909170151
0,0,the other good thing about it is jerry can be on here on friday and he can weigh in as well .,15,0.5,0.06451336294412613
0,0,yeah . and um if you can get that binding point also maybe with a nice example that would be helpful for johno and me .,15,0.5,0.12892910838127136
0,0,oh yeah uh ok . let 's uh yeah they 're,15,0.5,0.10348526388406754
0,0,give us,15,0.5,0.0920686349272728
0,0,"no problem ,",15,0.5,0.10886802524328232
0,0,"i think you 've got one on hand ,",15,0.5,0.11735190451145172
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10135132074356079
0,0,huh ?,15,0.5,0.0911770910024643
0,0,"i have several in my head , yeah . always thinking about binding .",15,0.5,0.16550923883914948
0,0,"well the the the binding is technically no problem but it 's it for me it seems to be conceptually important that we find out if we can s if if there if there are things in there that are sort of a general nature , we should distill them out and put them where the schemas are .",15,0.5,0.14337047934532166
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11752482503652573
0,0,"if there are things that you know are intention - specific , then we should put them up somewhere , a",15,0.5,0.16761542856693268
0,0,"so , in general they 'll be bindings across both intentions and the actions .",15,0.5,0.14803209900856018
0,0,yep . that 's wonderful .,15,0.5,0.11922123283147812
0,0,so yeah . so it 's gen it 's general across all of these things,15,0.5,0.15697768330574036
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08863544464111328
0,0,it 's like i mean shastri would say you know binding is like an essential cognitive uh process . so . um .,15,0.5,0.07079063355922699
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.17477001249790192
0,0,"so i do n't think it will be isolated to one or the two , but you can definitely figure out where yeah , sometimes things belong and so actually i 'm not sure i would be curious to see how separate the intention part and the action part are in the system . like i know the whole thing is like intention lattice , or something like that ,",15,0.5,0.09901247918605804
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11015865206718445
0,0,right ? so is the ri right now are the ideas the rich rich the rad or whatever is one you know potential block inside intention . it 's still it 's still mainly intention hypothesis,15,0.5,0.10446691513061523
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.09471431374549866
0,0,and then that 's just one way to describe the the action part of it .,15,0.5,0.11292770504951477
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09948627650737762
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09717977046966553
0,0,it 's an a attempt to refine it basically .,15,0.5,0.09754972904920578
0,0,"it 's and yeah ,",15,0.5,0.10850672423839569
0,0,"ok , great uh - huh .",15,0.5,0.11417412012815475
0,0,it 's an an it 's it 's sort of,15,0.5,0.19185137748718262
0,0,"not just that you want to go from here to here , it 's that the action is what you intend",15,0.5,0.08084076642990112
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10429591685533524
0,0,and this action consists of all com complicated modules and image schemas and whatever .,15,0.5,0.11361280828714371
0,0,yeah . and and there will be a a a relatively high level of redundancy,15,0.5,0.14261436462402344
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.06042804941534996
0,0,in the sense that um ultimately one,15,0.5,0.06035934388637543
0,0,"mm - hmm . which is , yeah , it 's fine",15,0.5,0.13490982353687286
0,0,"so th so that if we want to get really cocky we we will say `` well if you really look at it , you just need our rad . `` you can throw the rest away , right ?",15,0.5,0.1130090057849884
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1204797700047493
0,0,because you 're not gon na get anymore information out of the action a as you find it there in the domain object .,15,0.5,0.12950655817985535
0,0,right . right . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13474932312965393
0,0,"but then again um in this case , the domain object may contain information that we do n't really care about either . so .",15,0.5,0.11848025768995285
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11227753013372421
0,0,"h but w we 'll see that then , and how how it sort of evolves .",15,0.5,0.12742343544960022
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10293468832969666
0,0,"i mean if if people really like our our rad , i mean w what might happen is that they will get rid of that action thing completely , you know , and leave it up for us to get the parser input um",15,0.5,0.20037224888801575
0,0,mmm . we know the things that make use of this thing so that we can just change them so that they make use of rad .,15,0.5,0.14068900048732758
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.12084655463695526
0,0,you do n't have to use the acronym .,15,0.5,0.1271001249551773
0,0,"i ca n't believe we 're using this term . so i 'm like rad ! like every time i say it , it 's horrible . ok .",15,0.5,0.1260051727294922
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08457724750041962
0,0,i see what you mean .,15,0.5,0.13940787315368652
0,0,rad 's a great term .,15,0.5,0.12477278709411621
0,0,is the but what is the `` why `` ?,15,0.5,0.11262605339288712
0,0,"it 's rad , even !",15,0.5,0.0962316170334816
0,0,why ?,15,0.5,0.0958036556839943
0,0,why ?,15,0.5,0.09549747407436371
0,0,it happened to c be what it stands for .,15,0.5,0.09143039584159851
0,0,it just happened to be the acronym .,15,0.5,0.08900097757577896
0,0,well,15,0.5,0.10749870538711548
0,0,yeah . that 's does n't make it a great term . it 's just like those jokes where you have to work on both levels .,15,0.5,0.0916256532073021
0,0,ye no but i,15,0.5,0.10000256448984146
0,0,just think of it as as `` wheel `` in german .,15,0.5,0.12380937486886978
0,0,but if you if you if you work in th in that xml community it is a great acronym,15,0.5,0.0806904137134552
0,0,do you see what i mean ? like,15,0.5,0.11836528033018112
0,0,because it e evokes whatever rdf,15,0.5,0.13423438370227814
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.11736128479242325
0,0,rdf is the biggest thing right ? that 's the rich sort of `` resource description framework ``,15,0.5,0.09618615359067917
0,0,oh `` rich de ``,15,0.5,0.07614853233098984
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.1391965001821518
0,0,"and um and also so , description , having the word d term `` description `` in there is wonderful ,",15,0.5,0.090567946434021

0,0,who does n't like to be a,15,0.5,0.0959353968501091
0,0,everybody likes action .,15,0.5,0.12451385706663132

0,0,plus it 's hip . the kids 'll like it .,15,0.5,0.08891285955905914
0,0,but what if it 's not an action ?,15,0.5,0.13791489601135254

0,0,"lattices are big , too .",15,0.5,0.0671210065484047
0,0,and not only one pitch value but different kinds of pitch values,15,0.5,0.12789179384708405
0,0,"yeah , i mean , for something like that i would use p - file",15,0.5,0.14352288842201233
0,0,depending on,15,0.5,0.13231956958770752
0,0,or or any frame - level stuff i would use p - file .,15,0.5,0.0971762165427208

0,0,"uh , that 's a well , or something like it . it 's ics uh , icsi has a format for frame - level representation of features . um .",15,0.5,0.09414958953857422
0,0,ok . that you could call that you would tie into this representation with like an id .,15,0.5,0.14857403934001923
0,0,right . right . or or there 's a there 's a particular way in xml to refer to external resources .,15,0.5,0.1437825858592987
0,0,and ok .,15,0.5,0.10988826304674149
0,0,"so you would say `` refer to this external file `` . um , so that external file would n't be in",15,0.5,0.13429532945156097
0,0,so that might that might work .,15,0.5,0.1225871741771698
0,0,but what what 's the advantage of doing that versus just putting it into this format ?,15,0.5,0.15945816040039062
0,0,"more compact , which i think is is better .",15,0.5,0.10001658648252487
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08988747745752335
0,0,"i mean , if you did it at this",15,0.5,0.22831834852695465
0,0,"i mean these are long meetings and with for every frame ,",15,0.5,0.15493080019950867
0,0,you do n't want to do it with that anything at frame - level you had better encode binary,15,0.5,0.10341320931911469
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.09362185746431351
0,0,or it 's gon na be really painful .,15,0.5,0.14108115434646606
0,0,"or you just compre i mean , i like text formats . um , b you can always , uh , g - zip them , and , um , you know , c decompress them on the fly if y if space is really a concern .",15,0.5,0.10911507159471512
0,0,"yeah , i was thi i was thinking the advantage is that we can share this with other people .",15,0.5,0.23294121026992798
0,0,"well , but if you 're talking about one per frame , you 're talking about gigabyte - size files . you 're gon na actually run out of space in your filesystem for one file .",15,0.5,0.1518162339925766
0,0,these are big files . these are really i mean,15,0.5,0.1517450511455536
0,0,right ? because you have a two - gigabyte limit on most o ss .,15,0.5,0.14060655236244202
0,0,"right , ok . i would say ok , so frame - level is probably not a good idea . but for phone - level stuff it 's perfectly",15,0.5,0.1239761933684349
0,0,and th it 's,15,0.5,0.12122064083814621
0,0,"like phones , or syllables , or anything like that .",15,0.5,0.12273707985877991
0,0,"phones are every five frames though , so . or something like that .",15,0.5,0.14279858767986298
0,0,"but but but most of the frames are actually not speech . so , you know , people do n't v look at it , words times the average the average number of phones in an english word is , i do n't know , { comment } five maybe ?",15,0.5,0.0997789278626442
0,0,"yeah , but we actually",15,0.5,0.11008809506893158
0,0,"so , look at it , t number of words times five . that 's not that not",15,0.5,0.13567057251930237
0,0,"oh , so you mean pause phones take up a lot of the long pause phones .",15,0.5,0.07496147602796555
0,0,exactly .,15,0.5,0.18101654946804047
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.07670190185308456
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14297130703926086
0,0,yeah . ok . that 's true . but you do have to keep them in there . y yeah .,15,0.5,0.14683565497398376
0,0,so i think it it 's debatable whether you want to do phone - level in the same thing .,15,0.5,0.11862630397081375
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.14063997566699982
0,0,"but i think , a anything at frame - level , even p - file , is too verbose .",15,0.5,0.11865680664777756
0,0,ok . so,15,0.5,0.0865202471613884
0,0,i would use something tighter than p - files .,15,0.5,0.11497793346643448
0,0,do you are you familiar with it ?,15,0.5,0.10560645908117294
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.11171581596136093
0,0,"i have n't seen this particular format ,",15,0.5,0.13381364941596985
0,0,"i mean , i 've i 've used them .",15,0.5,0.08402485400438309
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.12172529101371765
0,0,i do n't know what their structure is .,15,0.5,0.11906308680772781
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10568726807832718
0,0,i 've forgot what the str,15,0.5,0.0922825038433075
0,0,"but , wait a minute , p - file for each frame is storing a vector of cepstral or plp values ,",15,0.5,0.08906371891498566
0,0,"it 's whatever you want , actually .",15,0.5,0.0994282141327858
0,0,right ? right .,15,0.5,0.10405947268009186
0,0,"so that what 's nice about the p - file it i built into it is the concept of frames , utterances , sentences , that sort of thing , that structure . and then also attached to it is an arbitrary vector of values . and it can take different types .",15,0.5,0.156422421336174
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.1603420227766037
0,0,"so it th they do n't all have to be floats . you know , you can have integers and you can have doubles , and all that sort of stuff .",15,0.5,0.10064803808927536
0,0,so that that sounds that sounds about what i w,15,0.5,0.0887322872877121
0,0,"um . right ? and it has a header it has a header format that describes it to some extent . so , the only problem with it is it 's actually storing the utterance numbers and the frame numbers in the file , even though they 're always sequential . and so it does waste a lot of space .",15,0.5,0.10813874751329422
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.0792885571718216
0,0,but it 's still a lot tighter than than ascii . and we have a lot of tools already to deal with it .,15,0.5,0.12088032811880112
0,0,you do ? ok . is there some documentation on this somewhere ?,15,0.5,0.17111782729625702
0,0,"yeah , there 's a ton of it . man - pages and , uh , source code , and me .",15,0.5,0.11451985687017441
0,0,"ok , great . so , i mean , that sounds good . i i was just looking for something i 'm not a database person , but something sort of standard enough that , you know , if we start using this we can give it out , other people can work on it ,",15,0.5,0.09108462929725647
0,0,"yeah , it 's not standard .",15,0.5,0.08760962635278702
0,0,or { comment } is it ?,15,0.5,0.0793568566441536
0,0,"i mean , it 's something that we developed at icsi . but , uh",15,0.5,0.05159810557961464
0,0,but it 's been used here,15,0.5,0.15102864801883698
0,0,but it 's been used here,15,0.5,0.11029407382011414
0,0,and people 've,15,0.5,0.16178974509239197
0,0,"and and , you know , we have a well - configured system that you can distribute for free , and",15,0.5,0.07657362520694733
0,0,"i mean , it must be the equivalent of whatever you guys used to store feat your computed features in , right ?",15,0.5,0.0578140914440155
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10033713281154633
0,0,"yeah , th we have actually , we we use a generalization of the the sphere format .",15,0.5,0.09099483489990234
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.12297487258911133
0,0,"um , but yeah , so there is something like that but it 's , um , probably not as sophist",15,0.5,0.09436504542827606
0,0,"well , what does h t k do for features ?",15,0.5,0.09015112370252609
0,0,and i think there 's,15,0.5,0.08437816053628922
0,0,or does it even have a concept of features ?,15,0.5,0.08172129839658737
0,0,"they ha it has its own i mean , entropic has their own feature format that 's called , like , s - sd or some so sf or something like that .",15,0.5,0.09748692065477371
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12913694977760315
0,0,"i 'm just wondering , would it be worth while to use that instead ?",15,0.5,0.09010876715183258
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08792709559202194
0,0,hmm ?,15,0.5,0.1140020489692688
0,0,yeah . th - this is exactly the kind of decision it 's just whatever,15,0.5,0.11893937736749649
0,0,"but , i mean , people do n't typically share this kind of stuff , right ?",15,0.5,0.12904733419418335
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08924944698810577
0,0,they generate their own .,15,0.5,0.09404907375574112
0,0,i mean yeah .,15,0.5,0.1318385899066925
0,0,"actually , i i just you know , we we 've done this stuff on prosodics and three or four places have asked for those prosodic files , and we just have an ascii , uh , output of frame - by - frame .",15,0.5,0.12323764711618423
0,0,"ah , right .",15,0.5,0.12761500477790833
0,0,"which is fine , but it gets unwieldy to go in and and query these files with really huge files .",15,0.5,0.11405440419912338
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.09486373513936996
0,0,"i mean , we could do it . i was just thinking if there 's something that where all the frame values are",15,0.5,0.18797072768211365
0,0,"and a and again , if you have a if you have a two - hour - long meeting , that 's gon na",15,0.5,0.10725327581167221
0,0,hmm ? they 're they 're fair they 're quite large .,15,0.5,0.07783370465040207
0,0,"yeah , i mean , they 'd be emo enormous .",15,0.5,0.12544390559196472
0,0,"and these are for ten - minute switchboard conversations ,",15,0.5,0.09624888002872467
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08001220226287842
0,0,"and so it 's doable , it 's just that you can only store a feature vector at frame - by - frame and it does n't have any kind of ,",15,0.5,0.13990895450115204
0,0,is is the sharing part of this a pretty important consideration,15,0.5,0.13519543409347534
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.08528245985507965
0,0,"or does that just sort of , uh a nice thing to have ?",15,0.5,0.12507295608520508
0,0,"i i do n't know enough about what we 're gon na do with the data . but i thought it would be good to get something that we can that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of encoding . and just , i mean we have to use some we have to make some decision about what to do .",15,0.5,0.12553343176841736
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.06758925318717957
0,0,"and especially for the prosody work , what what it ends up being is you get features from the signal , and of course those change every time your alignments change . so you re - run a recognizer , you want to recompute your features , um , and then keep the database up to date .",15,0.5,0.08797086775302887

0,0,"see , that matches the seat up there . so .",15,0.5,0.13726752996444702
0,0,"yeah , well , i g guess it 's coming up then , or",15,0.5,0.10783269256353378

0,0,right . this this is not it 's not bad for the project if keith is talking to george . ok . so my suggestion is we just,15,0.5,0.13373954594135284
0,0,forge ahead .,15,0.5,0.0920720100402832

0,0,are you in charge ?,15,0.5,0.1117323562502861
0,0,"sure . um . well , i sort of had informal talks with most of you . so , eva just reported she 's really happy about the cbt 's being in the same order in the xml as in the um be java declaration format",15,0.5,0.10848565399646759
0,0,yeah . the e,15,0.5,0.10310738533735275
0,0,so you do n't have to do too much in the style sheet transversion .,15,0.5,0.11445875465869904

0,0,yeah . yeah . and put them into different formats . oh,15,0.5,0.13463500142097473
0,0,i think you should demand things from him .,15,0.5,0.13161033391952515

0,0,"ok . so , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week , it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ? was that sort of the division ?",15,0.5,0.18112096190452576
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11150938272476196
0,0,so which week are we in ?,15,0.5,0.19412775337696075
0,0,"well we have n't really started , but i thought we more we more or less did meeting recorder stuff last week , so i thought we could do , uh",15,0.5,0.22962452471256256
0,0,i thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too .,15,0.5,0.14455614984035492
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.18800604343414307
0,0,"but i figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each .",15,0.5,0.13315211236476898
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1566825658082962

0,0,"uh , robert , do you uh have any way to turn off your uh screensaver on there so that it 's not going off every uh , it seems to have about at two minute",15,0.5,0.08987556397914886
0,0,"yeah , i 've i uh it 's not that i did n't try .",15,0.5,0.11679084599018097
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12984004616737366
0,0,"and um i i told it to stay on forever and ever , but if it 's not plugged in it just does n't obey my commands .",15,0.5,0.10597140341997147
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.05878860503435135
0,0,it has a mind .,15,0.5,0.07361581176519394
0,0,got it .,15,0.5,0.16826826333999634
0,0,"but i i just you know , sort of keep on wiggling .",15,0.5,0.12964211404323578
0,0,wants to conserve .,15,0.5,0.07969451695680618
0,0,"yeah , ok .",15,0.5,0.11499420553445816
0,0,but uh we 'll just be m m working on it at intensity so it does n't happen . we 'll see . should we plunge right into it ?,15,0.5,0.09966500848531723
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08477002382278442
0,0,"so , would you like to",15,0.5,0.10402245819568634
0,0,i think so .,15,0.5,0.15532585978507996
0,0,"so what i 've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this side . commented and what they 're about and sort of the properties we may um give them . and here are the uh tasks to be implemented via our data collection . so all of these tasks the reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there , sometime or the other . and analogously for example , here we have our eva um intention . and these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing . analogously the same on the object information we can see that , you know , we have sort of created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and that may or may not be a problem . we can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node so trying to im um implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever .",15,0.5,0.11628889292478561
0,0,"right , right .",15,0.5,0.06915362179279327
0,0,but i think that might be overdoing it a little .,15,0.5,0.11000052839517593
0,0,"so yeah . so let me pop up a level . and uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same . so what we 're gon na do today is two related things . uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . and decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules . so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gon na only have to choose parameters , but you know , a fairly large set of parameters . so to do that , we need to do two things . one of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount . then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . but we are n't gon na do the probability stuff today . technical stuff we 'll do uh another day . probably next week . but we are gon na worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . and we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with fey on what there should be in the dialogues . so one of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh in here , and have them actually record like this . uh record dialogues more or less . and depending on what fey sort of provokes them to say , we 'll get information on different things .",15,0.5,0.11328168958425522
0,0,"well how people phrase different intentions more or less ,",15,0.5,0.166365385055542
0,0,so fo - v yeah people with the phrase them,15,0.5,0.0992349311709404
0,0,huh ?,15,0.5,0.065218985080719
0,0,"and so uh for , you know , keith and people worrying about what constructions people use , uh we have some i we have some ways to affect that by the way the dialogues go . so what robert kindly did , is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh things that that might come up , and , the kinds of decisions . so the uh uh on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values . so if if we 're right , you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions , and it 's not all that many , and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief - nets that will do that . and he has a handout .",15,0.5,0.24585510790348053
0,0,"yeah . maybe it was too fast plunging in there , because j we have two updates .",15,0.5,0.11549622565507889
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1077180877327919
0,0,"um you can look at this if you want , these are what our subject 's going to have to fill out . any comments i can can still be made and the changes will be put in correspondingly .",15,0.5,0.07112297415733337
0,0,m yes .,15,0.5,0.14879485964775085

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.06805169582366943
0,0,or have you heard about it ?,15,0.5,0.09858869761228561
0,0,not that much you did n't .,15,0.5,0.12150809913873672
0,0,no . ok . we were gon na put this in front of people . they give us some information on themselves .,15,0.5,0.13032396137714386
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07997585088014603
0,0,then then they will read uh a task where lots of german words are sort of thrown in between . and um and they have to read isolated proper names and these change,15,0.5,0.1252683699131012
0,0,s i do n't see a release,15,0.5,0.1135418489575386
0,0,"no , this is not the release form . this is the speaker information form .",15,0.5,0.17790411412715912
0,0,"got it . ok , fine . ok .",15,0.5,0.15535327792167664
0,0,the release form is over there in that box .,15,0.5,0.11228606849908829
0,0,"alright , fair enough .",15,0.5,0.14634281396865845
0,0,"and um and then they gon na have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . they they pick a couple , say three uh uh six as a matter of fact . six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in heidelberg or traveling someplace and um and they have a map .",15,0.5,0.09151702374219894
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.15197797119617462
0,0,"like this . very sketchy , simplified map . and they can take notes on that map . and then they call this computer system that works perfectly , and understands everything .",15,0.5,0.12355245649814606
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09207764267921448
0,0,and um,15,0.5,0.15443791449069977
0,0,"this is a fictional system obviously ,",15,0.5,0.19585885107517242
0,0,"the comp yeah , the computer system sits right in front of you ,",15,0.5,0.14197631180286407
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.1021541953086853
0,0,that 's fey .,15,0.5,0.20950403809547424
0,0,i 've i understand everything .,15,0.5,0.07869096100330353
0,0,and she does know everything .,15,0.5,0.08699248731136322
0,0,yes i do .,15,0.5,0.08359683305025101
0,1,"yep . um , so , the last two weeks was , like so i 've been working on that wiener filtering . and , uh , found that , uh , s single like , i just do a s normal wiener filtering , like the standard method of wiener filtering . and that does n't actually give me any improvement over like i mean , uh , b it actually improves over the baseline but it 's not like it does n't meet something like fifty percent or something . so , i 've been playing with the v",15,0.5,0.07522065937519073
0,0,improves over the base line mfcc system ? yeah .,15,0.5,0.13190729916095734
0,0,"yeah . yeah . yeah . so , um so that 's the improvement is somewhere around , like , thirty percent over the baseline .",15,0.5,0.07672467827796936
0,0,is that using in combination with something else ?,15,0.5,0.07191120833158493
0,0,"no , just just one stage wiener filter",15,0.5,0.08488235622644424
0,0,with with a,15,0.5,0.0984790176153183
0,0,which is a standard wiener filter .,15,0.5,0.04936544597148895
0,0,"no , no , but i mean in combination with our on - line normalization or with the lda ?",15,0.5,0.07847582548856735
0,0,"yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . so i just plug in the wiener filtering .",15,0.5,0.10158798843622208
0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.1466440111398697
0,0,"i mean , in the s in our system , where",15,0.5,0.1020093783736229
0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.1390056014060974
0,0,"so , i di i di",15,0.5,0.12766222655773163
0,0,"so , does it g does that mean it gets worse ? or ?",15,0.5,0.08418059349060059
0,0,"no . it actually improves over the baseline of not having a wiener filter in the whole system . like i have an lda f lda plus on - line normalization , and then i plug in the wiener filter in that ,",15,0.5,0.05632423982024193
0,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.1429971158504486
0,0,so it improves over not having the wiener filter . so it improves but it it does n't take it like be beyond like thirty percent over the baseline . so,15,0.5,0.057902924716472626
0,0,"but that 's what i 'm confused about , cuz i think i thought that our system was more like forty percent without the wiener filtering .",15,0.5,0.07333517074584961
0,0,"no , it 's like , uh ,",15,0.5,0.0960962101817131
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.17060789465904236
0,0,is this with the v new vad ?,15,0.5,0.10573021322488785
0,0,"well , these are not no , it 's the old vad . so my baseline was , uh , nine this is like w the baseline is ninety - five point six eight , and eighty - nine , and",15,0.5,0.20477502048015594
0,0,"so i mean , if you can do all these in word errors it 's a lot a lot easier actually .",15,0.5,0.15108409523963928
0,0,what was that ? sorry ?,15,0.5,0.08795677870512009
0,0,"if you do all these in word error rates it 's a lot easier , right ?",15,0.5,0.144114151597023
0,0,"oh , ok , ok , ok . errors , right , i do n't have .",15,0.5,0.12125115841627121
0,0,"ok , cuz then you can figure out the percentages .",15,0.5,0.1425928771495819
0,0,it 's all accuracies .,15,0.5,0.06606826931238174
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1475999355316162
0,0,"the baseline is something similar to a w i mean , the t the the baseline that you are talking about is the mfcc baseline , right ?",15,0.5,0.07608529180288315
0,0,"the t yeah , there are two baselines .",15,0.5,0.10015629231929779
0,0,or ?,15,0.5,0.10281837731599808
0,0,ok . so the baseline one baseline is mfcc baseline that when i said thirty percent improvement it 's like mfcc baseline .,15,0.5,0.07443192601203918
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12319639325141907
0,0,so so so what 's it start on ? the mfcc baseline is is what ? is at what level ?,15,0.5,0.09675783663988113
0,0,it 's the it 's just the mel frequency and that 's it .,15,0.5,0.0876171737909317
0,0,"no , what 's what 's the number ?",15,0.5,0.1594947874546051
0,0,"uh , so i i do n't have that number here . ok , ok , ok , i have it here . uh , it 's the vad plus the baseline actually . i 'm talking about the the mfcc plus i do a frame dropping on it . so that 's like the word error rate is like four point three . like ten point seven .",15,0.5,0.1170365959405899
0,0,four point three . what 's ten point seven ?,15,0.5,0.09141676872968674
0,0,"it 's a medium misma ok , sorry . there 's a well ma well matched , medium mismatched , and a high matched .",15,0.5,0.09905296564102173
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.12660585343837738
0,0,so i do n't have the like the,15,0.5,0.09565594047307968
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10189766436815262

0,0,"ok , four point three , ten point seven ,",15,0.5,0.08480942249298096
0,0,and forty forty .,15,0.5,0.09505730867385864
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.10376964509487152
0,0,forty percent is the high mismatch .,15,0.5,0.07677452266216278
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09584622085094452
0,0,and that becomes like four point three,15,0.5,0.09204534441232681
0,0,not changed .,15,0.5,0.1038244366645813

0,0,can i ask just a a high level question ? can you just say like one or two sentences about wiener filtering and why why are people doing that ?,15,0.5,0.11584927886724472

0,0,"ok , so the wiener filter , it 's it 's like it 's like you try to minimize i mean , so the basic principle of wiener filter is like you try to minimize the , uh , d uh , difference between the noisy signal and the clean signal if you have two channels . like let 's say you have a clean t signal and you have an additional channel where you know what is the noisy signal .",15,0.5,0.053431686013936996

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10813333094120026

0,0,do you assume the noise is the same ?,15,0.5,0.07142926752567291

0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.1335899531841278

0,0,i see .,15,0.5,0.05449086055159569
0,0,"and and then you what you do is you , uh b fff . so again , i can write down some of these eq oh , ok . yeah . and then you do this uh , this is the transfer function of the wiener filter , so `` sf `` is a clean speech spectrum , power spectrum",15,0.5,0.06508774310350418

0,0,"and ,",15,0.5,0.12593629956245422
0,0,"actually , i guess",15,0.5,0.06930749118328094
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10574165731668472
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10227023810148239

0,0,i see . ok .,15,0.5,0.1217576190829277
0,0,"so but the thing is that you have to estimate the sf from the noisy spectrum , what you have . so you estimate the nf from the initial noise portions and then you subtract that from the current noisy spectrum to get an estimate of the sf . so sometimes that becomes zero because you do you do n't have a true estimate of the noise . so the f filter will have like sometimes zeros in it",15,0.5,0.06382919102907181

0,0,"so they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things with this task and see , you know , what are what are the issues for each of them .",15,0.5,0.17504964768886566
0,0,"ah , ok . that makes sense .",15,0.5,0.08717907965183258
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10795610398054123
0,0,yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14452703297138214

0,0,"cool , thanks .",15,0.5,0.09024129062891006
0,0,"so so one of one of the things that i tried , like i said , was to remove those zeros in the fri filter by doing some smoothing of the filter .",15,0.5,0.06464079022407532
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1370663344860077
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1468338966369629
0,0,"like , you estimate the edge of square and then you do a f smoothing across the frequency so that those zeros get , like , flattened out .",15,0.5,0.0888524278998375
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.227605938911438
0,0,and that does n't seems to be improving by trying it on the first time . so what i did was like i p did this and then you i plugged in the one more the same thing but with the smoothed filter the second time .,15,0.5,0.09642702341079712
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10795626044273376
0,0,and that seems to be working .,15,0.5,0.09392272680997849
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13331548869609833
0,0,"so that 's where i got like fifty - six point five percent improvement on speechdat - car with that . and so the other thing what i tried was i used still the ten frames of noise estimate but i used this channel zero vad to drop the frames . so i 'm not still not estimating . and that has taken the performance to like sixty - seven percent in speechdat - car , which is which which like sort of shows that by using a proper vad you can just take it to further , better levels . and so .",15,0.5,0.1445799022912979
0,0,"so that 's sort of like , you know , best - case performance ?",15,0.5,0.14872856438159943
0,0,"yeah , so far i 've seen sixty - seven i mean , no , i have n't seen s like sixty - seven percent . and , uh , using the channel zero vad to estimate the noise also seems to be improving but i do n't have the results for all the cases with that . so i used channel zero vad to estimate noise as a lesser 2 x frame , which is like , everywhere i use the channel zero vad . and that seems to be the best combination , uh , rather than using a few frames to estimate and then drop a channel .",15,0.5,0.09017019718885422

0,0,"nnn , no . this is just to test whether we can really improve by using a better vad .",15,0.5,0.09669211506843567

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11663433164358139
0,0,i mean so this is like the noise compensation f is fixed,15,0.5,0.07708529382944107
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.19415266811847687

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.07694512605667114
0,0,"so we c so i mean , which which means , like , by using this technique what we improve just the vad",15,0.5,0.08782082796096802
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.13058871030807495
0,0,we can just take the performance by another ten percent or better .,15,0.5,0.10874956101179123
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10508988052606583
0,0,"so , that that was just the , uh , reason for doing that experiment . and , w um yeah , but this all these things , i have to still try it on the ti - digits , which is like i 'm just running . and there seems to be not improving a a lot on the ti - digits , so i 'm like investigating that , why it 's not . and , um , um well after that . so , uh so the other the other thing is like i 've been i 'm doing all this stuff on the power spectrum . so tried this stuff on the mel as well mel and the magnitude , and mel magnitude , and all those things . but it seems to be the power spectrum seems to be getting the best result . so , one of one of reasons i thought like doing the averaging , after the filtering using the mel filter bank , that seems to be maybe helping rather than trying it on the mel filter ba filtered outputs .",15,0.5,0.10760173946619034

0,0,ma makes sense .,15,0.5,0.06995992362499237

0,0,it 's the main conference call . ok .,15,0.5,0.12100408226251602
0,0,"uh , yeah . there were like two hours of discussions , and then suddenly , uh , people were tired , i guess , and they decided on a number , two hundred and twenty , um , included e including everything . uh , it means that it 's like eighty milliseconds less than before .",15,0.5,0.11748853325843811
0,0,and what are we sitting at currently ?,15,0.5,0.13638654351234436

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09115023165941238

0,0,two thirty .,15,0.5,0.13157539069652557
0,0,yeah . so that 's the system that 's described on the second point of this document .,15,0.5,0.10267036408185959
0,0,so it 's we have to reduce it by ten milliseconds somehow .,15,0.5,0.06854750961065292
0,0,"yeah . but that 's yeah . that 's not a problem , i i guess .",15,0.5,0.10620152950286865
0,0,"ok . w it 's it 's p d primary primarily determined by the vad at this point ,",15,0.5,0.1154399961233139

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14452609419822693

0,0,"yeah , uh - huh .",15,0.5,0.0815967544913292
0,0,yeah . we probably should do that pretty soon so that we do n't get used to it being a certain way .,15,0.5,0.21601733565330505
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08623545616865158

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.12878431379795074
0,0,who was like,15,0.5,0.08992105722427368

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09276813268661499
0,0,"mmm uh , yeah . so , the second thing is the system that we have currently . oh , yes . we have , like , a system that gives sixty - two percent improvement , but if you want to stick to the this latency well , it has a latency of two thirty , but if you want also to stick to the number of features that limit it to sixty , then we go a little bit down but it 's still sixty - one percent . uh , and if we drop the tandem network , then we have fifty - seven percent .",15,0.5,0.08397641777992249

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.22733481228351593
0,0,"ok . and i is the tandem network , uh , small enough that it will fit on the terminal size in terms of ?",15,0.5,0.1181425154209137

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10448187589645386
0,0,"it 's still in terms of computation , if we use , like , their way of computing the the maps the the mips , i think it fits ,",15,0.5,0.12275595963001251
0,0,mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08647458255290985

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08628088235855103
0,0,"um , and i do n't know how much this can be discussed or not , because it 's it could be in rom , so it 's maybe not that expensive . but",15,0.5,0.11166713386774063

0,0,"yeah , there were small tricks to make this tandem network work . uh , mmm , and one of the trick was to , um , use some kind of hierarchical structure where the silence probability is not computed by the final tandem network but by the vad network . um , so apparently it looks better when , uh , we use the silence probability from the vad network",15,0.5,0.10929751396179199

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.11612208187580109
0,0,maybe it 's has something to do to the fact that we do n't have infinite training data and,15,0.5,0.14167112112045288

0,0,and mmm,15,0.5,0.12426342070102692
0,0,are you you were going to say why what made you wh what led you to do that .,15,0.5,0.148042231798172

0,0,um,15,0.5,0.0983383059501648
0,0,"that might be the key , actually .",15,0.5,0.09482832252979279
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13223525881767273
0,0,cuz you were really thinking about speech versus nonspeech for that .,15,0.5,0.1610449105501175
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08554887771606445
0,0,that 's a good point .,15,0.5,0.09666571766138077
0,0,"mmm . uh . well , there are other things that we should do but , um , it requires time and we have ideas , like so , these things are like hav having a better vad . uh , we have some ideas about that . it would probably implies working a little bit on features that are more suited to a voice activity detection .",15,0.5,0.06834369897842407
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13668864965438843
0,0,"working on the second stream . of course we have ideas on this also , but w we need to try different things and uh , but their noise estimation , um uh",15,0.5,0.06986767053604126
0,0,"i mean , back on the second stream , i mean , that 's something we 've talked about for a while . i mean , i think that 's certainly a high hope .",15,0.5,0.1282673180103302
0,0,yeah . mmm .,15,0.5,0.21594542264938354
0,0,"um , so we have this this default idea about just using some sort of purely spectral thing ?",15,0.5,0.10910074412822723
0,0,"uh , yeah .",15,0.5,0.04839588329195976
0,0,for a second stream ?,15,0.5,0.102980837225914
0,0,"but , um , we we did a first try with this , and it it clearly hurts .",15,0.5,0.09457714855670929
0,0,"but , uh , how was the stream combined ?",15,0.5,0.1431242972612381
0,0,"uh . it was c it was just combined , um , by the acoustic model . so there was , no neural network for the moment .",15,0.5,0.1205468475818634
0,0,"right . so , i mean , if you just had a second stream that was just spectral and had another neural net and combined there , that that , uh , might be good .",15,0.5,0.08914218097925186
0,0,"mm - hmm . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mmm . yeah . um yeah , and the other thing , that noise estimation and th um , maybe try to train uh , the training data for the t tandem network , right now , is like i is using the noises from the aurora task and i think that people might , um , try to argue about that because then in some cases we have the same noises in for training the network than the noises that are used for testing ,",15,0.5,0.09630782902240753
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10610143840312958
0,0,"and so we have t n uh , to try to get rid of these this problem .",15,0.5,0.08357925713062286
0,0,"yeah . maybe you just put in some other noise , something that 's different .",15,0.5,0.09278271347284317
0,0,mm - hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.15259869396686554
0,0,"i mean , it it 's probably helpful to have have a little noise there . but it may be something else",15,0.5,0.12486054748296738
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.10327452421188354
0,0,th at least you could say it was .,15,0.5,0.12175314128398895
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13632957637310028
0,0,"and then if it does n't hurt too much , though .",15,0.5,0.12656265497207642
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08638886362314224
0,1,ok so uh today we 're looking at a number of uh things we 're trying and uh fortunately for listeners to this uh we lost some of it 's visual but um got tables in front of us . um what is what does combo mean ?,15,0.5,0.16277669370174408
0,0,so combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the msg features . and so these low - pass filtered goes through m eh another mlp and then the linear output of these two mlp 's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this klt . um the output is used as uh features as well .,15,0.5,0.07016564160585403
0,0,um so let me try to restate this and see if i have it right . there is uh there is the features uh there 's the ogi features and then um those features um go through a contextual uh l l let 's take this bottom arr one pointed to by the bottom arrow . um those features go through a contextualized klt . then these features also uh get um low - pass filtered,15,0.5,0.07646645605564117
0,0,yeah . yeah so yeah i could perhaps draw this on the blackboard,15,0.5,0.1646093726158142
0,0,sure . yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.1026482954621315
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12123426795005798
0,0,"the graph , yeah another one .",15,0.5,0.1114894300699234
0,0,"yeah , that 's good .",15,0.5,0.08918637782335281
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.0769369825720787
0,0,so we have these features from ogi that goes through the three paths .,15,0.5,0.06290040910243988
0,0,"yeah . three , ok .",15,0.5,0.1205788403749466
0,0,the first is a klt using several frames of the features .,15,0.5,0.0672026202082634
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.144457146525383
0,0,the second path is uh mlp also using nine frames several frames of features,15,0.5,0.1178819015622139
0,0,yeah . uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.05268783122301102
0,0,the third path is this low - pass filter .,15,0.5,0.1373717188835144
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.1298317015171051
0,0,"uh , mlp",15,0.5,0.18247321248054504
0,0,aha ! aha !,15,0.5,0.19908061623573303
0,0,adding the outputs just like in the second propose the the proposal from for the first evaluation .,15,0.5,0.0746237188577652
0,0,yeah ? yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.07480638474225998
0,0,and then the klt and then the two together again .,15,0.5,0.09926900267601013
0,0,"no , the klt . and those two together . that 's it .",15,0.5,0.11087124794721603
0,0,two htk .,15,0.5,0.0973149985074997
0,0,ok so that 's that 's this bottom one .,15,0.5,0.06008511036634445
0,0,um . so this is yeah,15,0.5,0.0777551457285881
0,0,and so uh and then the the the one at the top and i presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they 're the best ?,15,0.5,0.0675845742225647
0,0,"yeah that 's the reason , yeah .",15,0.5,0.22702977061271667
0,0,oh let 's focus on them then so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ?,15,0.5,0.09997321665287018
0,0,for the f the f first yellow line you mean ?,15,0.5,0.05672769993543625
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08123302459716797
0,0,yeah so it 's uh basically s the same except that we do n't have this uh low - pass filtering so we have only two streams .,15,0.5,0.05714034661650658
0,0,step .,15,0.5,0.08112150430679321
0,0,well . there 's there 's no low low - pass processing used as additional feature stream .,15,0.5,0.07405855506658554
0,0,mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.21283796429634094
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.14159849286079407
0,0,do you e um they mentioned made some uh when i was on the phone with sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers .,15,0.5,0.1279793083667755
0,0,"yeah . uh actually the way things seems to um well it 's uh forty percent for ti - digit , sixty for all the speechdat - cars , well all these languages . ehm the well match is forty , medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty - five . yeah .",15,0.5,0.14899127185344696
0,0,um and we do n't have the ti - digits part yet ?,15,0.5,0.11756905168294907
0,0,"uh , no .",15,0.5,0.05250110477209091
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1474667638540268
0,0,but yeah . generally what you observe with ti - digits is that the result are very close whatever the the system .,15,0.5,0.12614375352859497
0,0,ok . and so have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that ?,15,0.5,0.14622727036476135
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1410834640264511
0,0,i mean not,15,0.5,0.08112048357725143
0,0,uh not yet .,15,0.5,0.06923452019691467
0,0,ok so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good,15,0.5,0.10960574448108673
0,0,"no . mmm yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.11244242638349533
0,0,then we could compare the two and say what was better .,15,0.5,0.09122969210147858
0,0,mmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.11764030158519745
0,0,um and how does this compare to the numbers oh so ogi two is just the top top row ?,15,0.5,0.11116718500852585
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08115361630916595
0,0,so yeah to actually ogi two is the the baseline with the ogi features but this is not exactly the result that they have because they 've they 're still made some changes in the features,15,0.5,0.07021449506282806
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1910575032234192
0,0,and well but uh actually our results are better than their results . um i do n't know by how much because they did not send us the new results,15,0.5,0.08863417059183121
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.14590764045715332
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.07449036836624146
0,0,uh ok so the one one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched italian .,15,0.5,0.10865702480077744
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.11239559203386307
0,0,an,15,0.5,0.07936713099479675
0,0,yeah there is something funny happening here because yeah .,15,0.5,0.0657140240073204
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13250352442264557
0,0,but there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are we are we are around forty - two and,15,0.5,0.10506331920623779
0,0,now up,15,0.5,0.09676865488290787
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.09288208931684494
0,0,uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a a second um silence detection .,15,0.5,0.0954684242606163
0,0,yeah . so there are some results here,15,0.5,0.14418736100196838
0,0,for the italian .,15,0.5,0.12344695627689362
0,0,uh so the third and the fifth line of the table,15,0.5,0.0788973718881607
0,0,for this one .,15,0.5,0.13147254288196564
0,0,so filt is what that is ?,15,0.5,0.08197920024394989
0,0,"filt , yeah",15,0.5,0.08723973482847214
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12307827919721603
0,0,um yeah so it seems f for the the well match and mismatched condition it 's uh it brings something . uh but uh actually apparently there are there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay . uh well,15,0.5,0.09757711738348007
0,0,oh we ca n't do it . oh ok .,15,0.5,0.12131223827600479
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.09608974307775497
0,0,for that for that we,15,0.5,0.11519314348697662
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.07516936212778091
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.043169256299734116
0,0,"too bad . good idea , but ca n't do it .",15,0.5,0.08395323902368546
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13112756609916687
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09782256186008453
0,0,except i do n't know because they i think they are still working well .,15,0.5,0.1193038821220398
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.11669554561376572
0,0,uh t two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector so but yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that 's on the handset and on the server side . perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and but well hmm for the moment they have this large delay on the the feature computation and so we do n't,15,0.5,0.18787729740142822
0,0,ok . so alright so for now at least that 's not there you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum does n't have a huge effect but it but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places .,15,0.5,0.070658840239048
0,0,i th,15,0.5,0.13153237104415894
0,0,uh little bit .,15,0.5,0.14280107617378235
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12407007813453674
0,0,um and um um yeah and uh let 's see what else did we have in there ? uh i guess it makes a l um at this point this is i i guess i should probably look at these others a little bit uh and you you yellowed these out uh but uh uh oh i see yeah that that one you ca n't use because of the delay . those look pretty good . um let 's see that one well even the just the the second row does n't look that bad right ? that 's just uh yeah ?,15,0.5,0.11699386686086655
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.08941931277513504
0,0,and and that looks like an interesting one too .,15,0.5,0.14371244609355927
0,0,mmm yeah .,15,0.5,0.0835244208574295
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.0673295259475708
0,0,actually the yeah the second line is uh pretty much like the first line in yellow except that we do n't have this klt on the first on the left part of the diagram . we just have the features as they are .,15,0.5,0.09054269641637802
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1256573647260666
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.1403200924396515
0,0,yeah . yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better . and it 's it 's it 's a little slightly simpler .,15,0.5,0.12468689680099487
0,0,mm - hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.07764171808958054
0,0,"so so there 's so i i would put that one also as a as a maybe . uh and it yeah and it 's actually does does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched italian , so s and little worse on the mis on the mm case , but uh well yeah it 's worse than a few things",15,0.5,0.0764579251408577
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10299726575613022
0,0,so uh let 's see how that c that c c see how that comes out on their their measure and are are we running this uh for ti - digits or uh,15,0.5,0.09334639459848404
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1291559934616089
0,0,"now is ti di is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of end of the month , the ti - digits are there also ?",15,0.5,0.09261983633041382
0,0,"yeah . yeah . it 's included , yeah .",15,0.5,0.18040727078914642
0,0,oh ok . ok . and see what else there is here . um oh i see the one i was looking down here at the the o the row below the lower yellowed one . uh that 's uh that 's with the reduced uh klt size reduced dimensionality .,15,0.5,0.08730064332485199
0,0,mm - hmm ? yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.10576803237199783
0,0,what happens there is it 's around the same and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps .,15,0.5,0.10891413688659668
0,0,"yeah , it 's it 's significantly worse well but mm - hmm .",15,0.5,0.12647737562656403
0,0,it 's significantly worse it 's it 's uh it 's it 's mostly worse .,15,0.5,0.11873195320367813
0,0,exc - except for the hm,15,0.5,0.13388416171073914
0,0,for many a mismatch it 's worse .,15,0.5,0.09565113484859467
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.14128050208091736
0,0,"yeah . but it is little . i mean not not by a huge amount , i do n't know . what are what are the sizes of any of these sets , i i 'm i 'm sure you told me before , but i 've forgotten . so you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ?",15,0.5,0.06792529672384262
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.08593492209911346
0,0,i do n't remember .,15,0.5,0.12805531919002533
0,0,about ?,15,0.5,0.12209145724773407
0,0,"um it 's it depends well the well matched is generally larger than the other sets and i think it 's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least .",15,0.5,0.09087777882814407
0,0,ye but words well word i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.11844699829816818
0,0,"hmm ? the words , yeah . s sentences .",15,0.5,0.11656396836042404
0,0,sentences .,15,0.5,0.12769284844398499
0,0,"some sets have five hundred sentences , so .",15,0.5,0.07216920703649521
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12724265456199646
0,0,"so the so the sets so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences , let 's say",15,0.5,0.09768015891313553
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.15961024165153503
0,0,and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it most of them longer or,15,0.5,0.14348861575126648
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08735333383083344
0,0,yeah for the italian even seven digits y more or less,15,0.5,0.1622762829065323
0,0,it it d seven digits .,15,0.5,0.1779516488313675
0,0,"but sometime the sentence have only one digit and sometime uh like uh the number of uh credit cards , something like that .",15,0.5,0.15454140305519104
0,0,"mm - hmm . right , so between one and sixteen . see the i mean the reason i 'm asking is is is we have all these small differences and i do n't know how seriously to take them , right ?",15,0.5,0.0953434482216835
0,0,mm - hmm ?,15,0.5,0.10404420644044876

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10461050271987915
0,0,um so um yeah it be kind of i 'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually .,15,0.5,0.1089547872543335
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15799137949943542
0,0,the size that we have ?,15,0.5,0.1717500388622284
0,0,we could we could run run some kind of significance tests,15,0.5,0.10802372545003891
0,0,"yeah since these well also just to know the numbers ,",15,0.5,0.13194817304611206
0,0,or,15,0.5,0.09139890223741531
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1495155245065689
0,0,right . so these these are word error rates,15,0.5,0.11738904565572739
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09851966053247452

0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.07573363929986954
0,0,yeah we have the result that the output of the htk,15,0.5,0.13040177524089813
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15111175179481506

0,0,yeah sure sure . yeah sure .,15,0.5,0.11072749644517899
0,0,yeah so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then then that that be great .,15,0.5,0.10663686692714691
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09734943509101868

0,0,"um what else is there here ? um see the second second from the bottom it says sil , but this is some different kind of silence or thing or what was that ?",15,0.5,0.10111421346664429
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.11443816870450974
0,0,it the the output silence of the mlp .,15,0.5,0.10267984122037888
0,0,oh yeah i see .,15,0.5,0.17730046808719635
0,0,it 's only one small experiment to know what happened . to apply also to in include also the the silence of the mlp we have the fifty - six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those .,15,0.5,0.11384309083223343
0,0,"yes . uh - huh , uh - huh . the silence plus the klt output ? oh so you 're only using the silence .",15,0.5,0.13049107789993286
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.17223110795021057
0,0,"yeah , because when we apply the klt",15,0.5,0.10191507637500763
0,0,no they 're i think there is this silence in addition to the um klt outputs,15,0.5,0.08802124112844467
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.128221333026886
0,0,"in addition , yes .",15,0.5,0.06624484807252884
0,0,it is because we we we just keep uh we do n't keep all the dimensions after the klt,15,0.5,0.07255788892507553
0,0,in addition t,15,0.5,0.08155447244644165
0,0,and yeah .,15,0.5,0.14020158350467682
0,0,and we not s we are not sure if we pick we have the silence .,15,0.5,0.08909132331609726
0,0,so we try to add the silence also in addition to the these twenty - eight dimensions .,15,0.5,0.1769275814294815
0,0,i see . ok . and what and what 's ogi forty - five ? the bottom one there ?,15,0.5,0.11790099740028381
0,0,"uh it 's o it 's ogi two , it 's so the th it 's the features from the first line",15,0.5,0.06729726493358612
0,0,it 's in fact ogi two .,15,0.5,0.2321578860282898

0,0,"right , but i mean what 's the what does the last row mean ?",15,0.5,0.11045440286397934
0,0,so it 's uh basically this but without the klt on the from the left path .,15,0.5,0.0903981477022171
0,0,i thought that was the one i thought that was the second row . so what 's the difference between the second,15,0.5,0.08602242916822433
0,0,uh the second line you do n't have this combo stuff so you just,15,0.5,0.10938645899295807
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.08235827088356018
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.062195297330617905
0,0,so this is like the second line but with with the combo stuff .,15,0.5,0.11752976477146149
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.1289645880460739

0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.07387898117303848
0,0,"ok , so alright so it looks to me i guess the same given that we have to take the filt ones out of the the running because of this delay problem so it looks to me like the ones you said i agree are are the ones to look at",15,0.5,0.10251477360725403
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.16705618798732758

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.11649321019649506
0,0,"oh yeah also when when they 're using this weighting scheme of forty , thirty - five , twenty - five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors ? i guess it 's probably on the percentages right ?",15,0.5,0.10290896147489548
0,0,"uh i guess , yeah .",15,0.5,0.06442517042160034

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1406441628932953
0,0,"so , anyway , i can talk about digits . um , did everyone get the results or shall i go over them again ? i mean that it was basically the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well . um , and in retrospect that 's not as surprising as maybe i it should n't have been as surprising as i as as i felt it was . the lapel mike is a very high - quality microphone . and as morgan pointed out , that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling if no one else is talking .",15,0.5,0.10874273627996445

0,0,it 's g it,15,0.5,0.08396709710359573
0,0,or the cross - talk . yeah .,15,0.5,0.1344405710697174

0,0,"right . i mean , a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits ,",15,0.5,0.18308216333389282
0,0,it 's it 's,15,0.5,0.10421687364578247
0,0,so it 's it 's a very different task than sort of the natural .,15,0.5,0.1262645125389099
0,0,"yeah . you do n't move much during reading digits , i think .",15,0.5,0.0821474939584732

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14016233384609222
0,0,"right . so in the digits , in most most cases , there were n't other people talking .",15,0.5,0.12692329287528992
0,0,right . right .,15,0.5,0.06955941021442413

0,0,"they have a little bit ,",15,0.5,0.1035386323928833
0,0,and then it would,15,0.5,0.11284440010786057
0,0,"but they 're not noise - cancelling . so , uh",15,0.5,0.09604533761739731
0,0,they 're they 're intended to be omni - directional .,15,0.5,0.0844331905245781

0,0,"and and it was uh , i mean , there the point of interest to the group was primarily that , um , the , uh the system that we had that was based on h t k , that 's used by , you know , all the participants in aurora , was so much worse than the than the s r",15,0.5,0.17647117376327515

0,0,"um . a a a couple percent or some i mean well , i do n't know it overall uh , i i do n't remember , but there was there was a significant , um , loss or win { comment } from adaptation with with adaptation . and , um , that was the phone - loop adaptation . and then there was a very small like point one percent on the natives uh , win from doing , um , you know , adaptation to the recognition hypotheses . and i tried both means adaptation and means and variances , and the variances added another or subtracted another point one percent . so , it 's , um that 's the number there . point six , i believe , is what you get with both , uh , means and variance adaptation .",15,0.5,0.08287297934293747

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.130166158080101

0,0,yeah . no problem .,15,0.5,0.09367965161800385
0,0,so you just make a f,15,0.5,0.11855199187994003
0,0,"yeah . yeah . cuz our sense from the other from the aurora , uh , task is that",15,0.5,0.14433680474758148

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11228609085083008

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.13446712493896484
0,0,"one is , yeah , the sri system is a lot better than the htk",15,0.5,0.09595367312431335

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1010499894618988
0,0,"uh , but the other is that , um , the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the studio - recording ti - digits . i think , you know , one reason for that , uh , might be that there 's still even though it 's close - talking , there still is some noise and some room acoustics .",15,0.5,0.09982217103242874
0,0,mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.23911111056804657
0,0,"and another might be that , uh , i 'd i would presume that in the studio , uh , uh , situation recording read speech that if somebody did something a little funny or n pronounced something a little funny or made a little that they did n't include it ,",15,0.5,0.16790562868118286
0,0,they did n't include it .,15,0.5,0.08690830320119858

0,0,mmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.16558820009231567
0,0,"so that , if someone just read the wrong digit , i corrected it .",15,0.5,0.09877117723226547
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.18847166001796722
0,0,and then there was another one where jose could n't tell whether i could n't tell whether he was saying zero or six . and i asked him and he could n't tell either .,15,0.5,0.09938419610261917
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.15570586919784546
0,0,so i just cut it out .,15,0.5,0.08994841575622559
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15793481469154358
0,0,"you know , so i just e edited out the first , i uh , word of the utterance . um , so there 's a little bit of correction but it 's definitely not as clean as ti - digits . so my expectations is ti - digits would , especially i think ti - digits is all american english .",15,0.5,0.1407310664653778
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1438976228237152
0,0,"right ? so it would probably do even a little better still on the sri system , but we could give it a try .",15,0.5,0.0863567590713501
0,0,"well . but remember , we 're using a telephone bandwidth front - end here , uh , on this , uh on this sri system , so , um , i was i thought that maybe that 's actually a good thing because it it gets rid of some of the uh , the noises , um , you know , in the the below and above the um , the , you know , speech bandwidth",15,0.5,0.07410667836666107

0,0,"and , um , i suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher - quality recordings you would have to in fact , uh , use models that , uh , were trained on wider - band data . and of course we ca n't do that or",15,0.5,0.16909737884998322
0,0,wha - what 's ti - digits ? i thought t,15,0.5,0.09899555891752243
0,0,"it 's wide - band , yeah . it 's in in fact , we looked it up",15,0.5,0.16508637368679047
0,0,it is wide - band . ok .,15,0.5,0.0881146788597107
0,0,and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling .,15,0.5,0.10342614352703094
0,0,"oh , that 's right . i i did look that up .",15,0.5,0.12152550369501114
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.16821086406707764
0,0,i could n't remember whether that was ti - digits or one of the other digit tasks .,15,0.5,0.1323871910572052
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10687526315450668
0,0,"right . but but , i would yeah . it 's it 's easy enough to try , just run it on",15,0.5,0.09018956124782562
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08620957285165787

0,0,see w,15,0.5,0.08762121945619583
0,0,"so , morgan , you 're getting a little breath noise .",15,0.5,0.1116233840584755
0,0,"now , eh , does",15,0.5,0.18912141025066376
0,0,you might wan na move the mike down a little bit .,15,0.5,0.12125691771507263
0,0,"one one issue one issue with with that is that um , the system has this , uh , notion of a speaker to which is used in adaptation , variance norm uh , you know , both in , uh , mean and variance normalization and also in the vtl estimation .",15,0.5,0.08376669138669968
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12943358719348907
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.10959155857563019
0,0,"yeah , i noticed the script that extracted it .",15,0.5,0.13613231480121613
0,0,"do y ? is ? so does so th so does does , um , the ti - digits database have speakers that are known ?",15,0.5,0.0987643450498581
0,0,yep . yep .,15,0.5,0.12935620546340942
0,0,and is there is there enough data or a comparable comparable amount of data to to what we have in our recordings here ?,15,0.5,0.2332097291946411
0,0,"that i do n't know . i do n't know . i do n't know how many speakers there are ,",15,0.5,0.0564386248588562
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14976216852664948
0,0,and and how many speakers per utterance .,15,0.5,0.09993487596511841
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08326458930969238
0,0,"well , the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation . that would",15,0.5,0.12399431318044662
0,0,"right . uh , but i 'm not so much worried about the adaptation , actually , than than the , um , um the , uh , vtl estimation .",15,0.5,0.09197138249874115
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.20533962547779083
0,0,"if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the the warping , uh , factor . so , um",15,0.5,0.14231427013874054
0,0,"i strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do . so , uh",15,0.5,0.1145721897482872
0,0,"right . but it 's not the amount of speakers , it 's the num it 's the amount of data per speaker .",15,0.5,0.11403759568929672
0,0,right . so we we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent .,15,0.5,0.0902806967496872
0,0,right . right .,15,0.5,0.13678230345249176
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.1408420205116272
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.15693633258342743
0,0,"so , although i i sort of know how to run it , there are a little a f few details here and there that i 'll have to dig out .",15,0.5,0.13679081201553345
0,0,ok . the key so th the system actually extracts the speaker id from the waveform names .,15,0.5,0.07405287027359009
0,0,right . i saw that .,15,0.5,0.1319042444229126
0,0,"and there 's a there 's a script and that is actually all in one script . so there 's this one script that parses waveform names and extracts things like the , um , speaker , uh , id or something that can stand in as a speaker id . so , we might have to modify that script to recognize the , um , speakers , um , in the in the , uh , um , ti - digits database .",15,0.5,0.09779763966798782
0,0,"right . right . and that , uh",15,0.5,0.08534186333417892
0,0,or you can fake you can fake names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the for the meetings .,15,0.5,0.15032334625720978
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11862222850322723
0,0,"that would be the , sort of probably the safest way to do",15,0.5,0.1504511535167694
0,0,i might have to do that anyway to to do because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right .,15,0.5,0.09349746257066727
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.148562490940094
0,0,"the other thing is , is n't ti - digits isolated digits ?",15,0.5,0.23054581880569458
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.09939049184322357
0,0,"or is that another one ? i 'm i looked through a bunch of the digits t corp corpora , and now they 're all blurring .",15,0.5,0.13659311830997467
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1682330071926117
0,0,cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit . and then others were connected digits .,15,0.5,0.2290964126586914
0,0,"yeah . most of ti - digits is connected digits , i think .",15,0.5,0.1315339356660843
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09451036900281906

0,0,maybe it 's the bell gram . bell digits . alright .,15,0.5,0.22272813320159912
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.17771460115909576
0,0,"by the way , i think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr improve them by , um , not starting with the switchboard models but by taking the switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting .",15,0.5,0.12669283151626587
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.11359946429729462
0,0,"because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics and f for the far - field microphones , you know , to the noise . and that should really improve things , um , further . and then you use those adapted models , which are not speaker adapted but sort of acous you know , channel adapted",15,0.5,0.19493508338928223
0,0,channel adapted .,15,0.5,0.11991331726312637

0,0,"yeah . but the thing is , uh i mean , w when you it depends whether you 're ju were just using this as a a starter task for you know , to get things going for conversational or if we 're really interested i in connected digits . and i i think the answer is both . and for for connected digits over the telephone you do n't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation",15,0.5,0.13009533286094666
0,0,"well , i do n't know .",15,0.5,0.12350389361381531

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12801483273506165

0,0,that looks good . yeah .,15,0.5,0.07917526364326477

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.06495852023363113
0,0,"um . the other thing that that , uh of course , what barry was looking at was was just that , the near versus far . and , yeah , the adaptation would get th some of that .",15,0.5,0.09746791422367096
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13611094653606415
0,0,"but , i think even even if there was , uh , only a factor of two or something , like i was saying in the email , i think that 's that 's a big factor . so",15,0.5,0.1300078183412552

0,0,um,15,0.5,0.22976499795913696

0,0,"right . ok . well , let 's see . i think the a certainly the segmentation and recognition we wan na maybe focus on when an - andreas is here since that was particularly his thing .",15,0.5,0.1961929351091385
0,0,and also the smartkom thing should b,15,0.5,0.21377012133598328
0,0,"smartkom also , andreas . absinthe , i think also he has sort of been involved in a lot of those things .",15,0.5,0.14865516126155853

0,0,"um so , i mean , i think they 'll be inter i 'll be interested in all this , but but , uh , probably , if we had to pick something that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they 're coming here . or i guess it would be , you think , reorganization status , or ?",15,0.5,0.06698303669691086
0,0,"yeah . i mean , i think , chuck was the one who added out the agenda item . i do n't really have anything to say other than that we still have n't done it .",15,0.5,0.09993764013051987
0,0,"well , i mean , i uh just basically that",15,0.5,0.08705545961856842
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.17453764379024506
0,0,maybe i said maybe we said this before just that we met and we talked about it and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized and,15,0.5,0.16640473902225494
0,0,"and i and i think a crucial part of that is the idea of of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back - up so that there wo n't be huge number of of added ,",15,0.5,0.0781097263097763

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.17079876363277435
0,0,that that was basically it . not not much @ @,15,0.5,0.14314168691635132
0,0,"although dave basically said that if we wan na do it , just tell him and he 'll do a d level zero then .",15,0.5,0.10171566903591156
0,0,"yeah . uh - huh . oh , excellent .",15,0.5,0.08267805725336075

0,0,"oh , good .",15,0.5,0.11059875041246414
0,0,"oh , so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready , and",15,0.5,0.10188507288694382
0,0,"yep . so , i think we do need to talk a little bit about well , we do n't need to do it during this meeting .",15,0.5,0.11837178468704224
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15214647352695465
0,0,"we have a little more to discuss . but , uh , we 're we 're basically ready to do it . and , uh , i have some web pages on ts { comment } more of the background . so , naming conventions and things like that , that i 've been trying to keep actually up to date . so . and i 've been sharing them with u - d uw folks also .",15,0.5,0.11583820730447769
0,0,"i 'm sorry , you 've been what ? showing them ?",15,0.5,0.08243950456380844

0,0,sharing them .,15,0.5,0.11342416703701019
0,0,sharing them with the uw folks .,15,0.5,0.12856577336788177
0,0,ok . ok .,15,0.5,0.08202013373374939
0,0,"ok . well , maybe uh , since that that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the ibm transcription status . someone can fill in liz and andreas later . uh",15,0.5,0.13882344961166382
0,0,"ok . so , we , uh we did another version of the beeps , where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit . chuck came up here and recorded some di himself speaking some digits , and so it just goes `` beep one beep `` and then the phrase , and then `` beep two beep `` and then the phrase . and that seems pretty good . um , i think they 'll have a b easier time keeping track of where they are in the file .",15,0.5,0.18568174540996552
0,0,and we have done that on the automatic segmentations .,15,0.5,0.1327904462814331
0,0,"and we did it with the automatic segmentation , and i do n't think we ne we did n't look at it in detail . we just sent it to ibm . we we sorta spot - checked it .",15,0.5,0.07763103395700455
0,0,"i listened to probably , uh , five or ten minutes of it from the beginning .",15,0.5,0.055294182151556015
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1293283998966217

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09722276777029037
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.08543193340301514
0,0,i sorta spot - checked here and there and it sounded pretty good . so . i think it 'll work .,15,0.5,0.08514440059661865
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10875140130519867
0,0,"and , uh , we 'll just hafta see what we get back from them . uh",15,0.5,0.12536336481571198
0,0,"and the main thing will be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them . i mean , that 's the crucial part .",15,0.5,0.0990067571401596
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10128892958164215
0,0,and i think we 'll be able to do that at with this new beep format .,15,0.5,0.19089961051940918
0,0,"yep . well , i think it 's also they are much less likely to d have errors .",15,0.5,0.07841119170188904
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1071113869547844
0,0,"i mean , so the problem wi last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there were n't any , or and they put in extraneous beeps .",15,0.5,0.11816897988319397
0,0,right . yeah .,15,0.5,0.08896774798631668
0,0,"and with the numbers there , it 's much less likely .",15,0.5,0.14007443189620972
0,0,"yeah , one interesting note is uh , or problem i dunno if this was just because of how i play it back , i say , uh , snd - play and then the file , every once in a while , @ @ { comment } uh , like a beep sounds like it 's cut into two beeps .",15,0.5,0.1514895260334015
0,0,yeah . into two pieces .,15,0.5,0.07085777819156647
0,0,"yeah , and i i dunno if that 's an , uh , artifact of playback",15,0.5,0.07435673475265503
0,0,yeah . yep .,15,0.5,0.07864619046449661
0,0,"bu uh , i do n't think it 's probably in the original file . um , but , uh",15,0.5,0.10606661438941956
0,0,"i recognize that , too . yeah .",15,0.5,0.11868865042924881
0,0,ha . that 's interesting . i did n't hear that .,15,0.5,0.1115138903260231
0,0,"yeah . but with this new format , um , that hopefully they 're not hearing that , and if they are , it should n't throw them .",15,0.5,0.15976493060588837
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.08928439021110535
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.12365170568227768
0,0,"well , maybe we better listen to it again , make sure , but , i mean , certainly the software should n't do that ,",15,0.5,0.06179533526301384
0,0,yeah . that 's what i thought .,15,0.5,0.13688337802886963
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.08839133381843567
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12056092917919159
0,0,"i it 's probably just , you know , mmm , somehow the audio device gets hung for a second ,",15,0.5,0.07015646994113922
0,0,yeah . some latency or something .,15,0.5,0.08306179940700531

0,0,yeah . right .,15,0.5,0.14053069055080414
0,0,yeah . the only the only part that might be confusing is when chuck is reading digits .,15,0.5,0.10725553333759308
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10614052414894104

0,0,"yes . because , uh , we do n't we did n't in order to cut them out we 'd have to listen to it .",15,0.5,0.10198104381561279
0,0,we we did n't cut those out .,15,0.5,0.1630922257900238

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10531353205442429
0,0,"we can we can ignore it when we get it back ,",15,0.5,0.12901906669139862
0,0,"although we could tell them { comment } we could tell them , if you hear someone reading a digits string just say `` bracket digit bracket ``",15,0.5,0.12002824246883392
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.1284146010875702
0,0,and do n't bother actually computing the di writing down the digits .,15,0.5,0.19106657803058624
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1526259183883667

0,0,yep . and then i wanted to talk about but as i said i we may not have time what we should do about digits . we have a whole pile of digits that have n't been transcribed .,15,0.5,0.0959908589720726
0,0,"le - let 's talk about it , because that 's that 's something that i i know andreas is less interested in than liz is ,",15,0.5,0.10118565708398819

0,0,do we have anything else to say about transcription ? about ibm stuff ?,15,0.5,0.12436243146657944
0,0,"uh , brian i i sent bresset sent brian a message about the meeting and i have n't heard back yet . so . i g hope he got it and hopefully he 's",15,0.5,0.07920850068330765

0,0,"alright . so , we have a whole bunch of digits , if we wan na move on to digits .",15,0.5,0.1732095330953598
0,0,"actually , maybe i one one relate more related thing in transcription . so that 's the ibm stuff . we 've got that sorted out . um , how 're we doing on the on the rest of it ?",15,0.5,0.15015965700149536

0,0,"yeah , uh , so twenty hours . but i guess the other thing is that , um , that that 's kinda twenty hours asap because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours , the more time it 'll be for people to actually do cool things with it .",15,0.5,0.09985893964767456

0,0,is that most of what it ?,15,0.5,0.1042916402220726
0,0,and correcting .,15,0.5,0.0950273871421814
0,0,i mean correcting .,15,0.5,0.09790822118520737

0,0,"oh , right .",15,0.5,0.07770480960607529

0,0,"i see what you mean . a backchannel , or",15,0.5,0.16325661540031433

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.15021678805351257
0,0,"and they 're rare events , but you can really go through a meeting very quickly . you just you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips . and , i think that we 're gon na end up with , uh better coverage of the backchannels ,",15,0.5,0.11323829740285873

0,0,"hmm . ok . uh , yeah . so , uh yeah . so let 's talk about the digits , since they 're not here yet .",15,0.5,0.08347748965024948
0,0,"uh , so , we have a whole bunch of digits that we 've read and we have the forms and so on , um , but only a small number of that ha well , not a small number only a subset of that has been transcribed . and so we need to decide what we wan na do . and , uh , liz and andreas actually they 're not here , but , they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment . and , again , i do n't think we 'll be able to do with that alone , because , um , sometimes people correct themselves and things like that . but so , i was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits , doing a forced alignment , and doing the timing .",15,0.5,0.19666318595409393

0,0,"i mean , so one option i",15,0.5,0.1342313438653946
0,0,"because people make mistakes and stuff . i was just asking , just out of curiosity , if if with , uh uh , the sri recognizer getting one percent word error , uh , would we would we do better ? so , if you do a forced alignment but the force but the but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes , uh , or false starts , it 's it 's much less c it 's much less common than one percent ?",15,0.5,0.16074499487876892

0,0,we should be able to .,15,0.5,0.10453791171312332

0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.09341573715209961
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1131451204419136

0,0,"but , well , there there 're a couple different of doing it . we could use the tools i 've already developed and transcribe it . hire some people , or use the transcribers to do it . we could let ibm transcribe it . you know , they 're doing it anyway , and unless we tell them different , they 're gon na transcribe it . um , or we could try some automated methods .",15,0.5,0.11787696927785873

0,0,"yeah , it 's y you raised a point , kind of , uh , euphemistically but , i mean , m maybe it is a serious problem . ho - what will they do when they go hear `` beep seven beep seven three five two `` i mean , you think they 'll we 'll get ?",15,0.5,0.09836504608392715

0,0,yep . yeah she she did n't explicitly state that so .,15,0.5,0.10053741186857224
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.14856180548667908
0,0,and um i told her that we gon na um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s look for the potential sources to find people . she also agrees that you know if it 's all just gon na be students the data is gon na be less valuable because of that so .,15,0.5,0.15854795277118683

0,0,we 're already yeah .,15,0.5,0.0774298682808876

0,0,"however , we may run into a problem with a reading task there . and um , we 'll see .",15,0.5,0.2023511528968811
0,0,"yeah . we could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there 's a task , pays ten bucks or something ,",15,0.5,0.09768801182508469
0,0,mm - hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.11335177719593048
0,0,but um you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff . and and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent .,15,0.5,0.17067758738994598
0,0,mmm . yep .,15,0.5,0.06860027462244034

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.15929515659809113
0,0,"so , my idea on that was uh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists , but partly i did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all um you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically , because to the extent that we can get them contributing , that will be good . so this issue about you know re - formulating things ,",15,0.5,0.14436295628547668

0,0,mm - hmm . sounds good . the uh other two things is um we 've can have johno tell us a little about this,15,0.5,0.1212710291147232

0,0,"so , what i did for this this is uh , a pedagogical belief - net because i was i i took i tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out so what i did was i took i made these dummy nodes called trajector - in and trajector - out that would isolate the things related to the trajector .",15,0.5,0.08706868439912796

0,0,"ok , great . alright .",15,0.5,0.11837674677371979
0,0,so basically all i did was i took the last belief - net,15,0.5,0.1407005339860916
0,0,so mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.06488599628210068
0,0,and i grouped things according to what how i thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related . and the two that i came up with were trajector - landmark and then source - path - goal as initial ones .,15,0.5,0.07090584933757782

0,0,"right , yep .",15,0.5,0.0870782881975174

0,0,"or they were hurried . that 's kind of related to that . and then um in terms of the source , the things uh the only things that we had on there i believe were whether oh actually , i kind of , i might have added these cuz i do n't think we talked too much about the source in the old one but uh whether the where i 'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether",15,0.5,0.1284513622522354

0,0,"right , ok .",15,0.5,0.06774035096168518

0,0,"oh , ok . so , so if you if we made if we wanted to make it into a a real uh bayes - net , that is , you know , with fill you know , actually f uh , fill it @ @ in , then uh",15,0.5,0.18673333525657654
0,0,so we 'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the mode .,15,0.5,0.1310395747423172
0,0,"well , i do n't that 's an issue . so , um",15,0.5,0.10110113024711609
0,0,cuz i do n't understand how it would work otherwise .,15,0.5,0.14690935611724854
0,0,"well , here 's the problem . and and uh bhaskara and i was talking about this a little earlier today is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the mode thing . and uh",15,0.5,0.06803654134273529
0,0,"well i oh yeah , i unders i understand that , i just uh it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that .",15,0.5,0.137080579996109

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10868557542562485
0,0,"ok , so , so , uh . there there are a variety of ways of doing it . uh . let me just mention something that i do n't want to pursue today which is there are technical ways of doing it , uh i i slipped a paper to bhaskara and about noisy - or 's and noisy - maxes and there 're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your bayes - net - edness .",15,0.5,0.11128313094377518
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.14349228143692017
0,0,"uh , so . if you co you could ima and i now i do n't know that any of those actually apply in this case , but there is some technology you could try to apply .",15,0.5,0.11784800887107849
0,0,so it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that ok .,15,0.5,0.09480687975883484
0,0,"yeah . yeah . and , um so .",15,0.5,0.11697233468294144
0,0,"so in that case , the sum we 'd have we i mean , these would n't be the summary nodes . we 'd have the summary nodes like where the things were i guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other",15,0.5,0.09879086166620255
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08022554963827133
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1135890781879425
0,0,"so what i was gon na say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally i mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . so , if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode , you know , what are the most relevant things .",15,0.5,0.10447587817907333
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.14169612526893616
0,0,"and the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n each node sufficiently narrow that you do n't get this combinatorics . so that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be , ok ? then you could say `` aha , let 's have these three factors `` , ok ? and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one .",15,0.5,0.1288381665945053
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.16126777231693268
0,0,"and then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about . so that y so that , you know , you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing",15,0.5,0.1290980726480484
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1511586606502533
0,0,"given that we 're not gon na screw with the technology and just always use uh sort of orthodox bayes - nets , then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that . um and",15,0.5,0.16852355003356934
0,0,so what i kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ?,15,0.5,0.09475572407245636
0,0,`` eh - eh - eh . `` yeah .,15,0.5,0.08618751913309097
0,0,so that,15,0.5,0.13338324427604675
0,0,"well , mmm , something . i mean , so uh , robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around , so he may have some good intuition about you know , what are the crucial things .",15,0.5,0.16725097596645355

0,0,"uh , i do n't think our friends uh on wednesday are going to be able to well , maybe they will . well , let me think about whether whether i think we can present this to them or not . um , uh ,",15,0.5,0.11187400668859482
0,0,"well , i think this is still , i mean , ad - hoc . this is sort of th the second version and i i i look at this maybe just as a , you know , a a whatever , uml diagram or , you know , as just a uh screen shot , not really as a bayes - net as john johno said .",15,0.5,0.12557850778102875

0,0,and uh,15,0.5,0.08432558178901672
0,0,and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that that is helpful to them .,15,0.5,0.2079095095396042
0,0,"i mean , ultimately we we may w w we regard this as sort of an exercise in in thinking about the problem and maybe a first version of uh a module , if you wan na call it that , that you can ask , that you can give input and it it 'll uh throw the dice for you , uh throw the die for you , because um i integrated this into the existing smartkom system in in the same way as much the same way we can um sort of have this uh this thing . close this down . so if this is what m - three - l um will look like and what it 'll give us , um and a very simple thing . we have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace .",15,0.5,0.0908481627702713

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10327930748462677
0,0,"so i do n't see the problem . the biggest problem of course is that f that alcatel french telecom cl claims `` well we fulfilled the conditions . we are the best . uh . we are the standard . `` and e and other people do n't feel that , because they so they now decided that that is the whole thing will be done on well - endpointed data , essentially that somebody will endpoint the data based on clean speech , because most of this the speechdat - car has the also close speaking mike and endpoints will be provided .",15,0.5,0.12215886265039444

0,0,"and uh we will run again still not clear if we are going to run the if we are allowed to run uh uh new algorithms , but i assume so . because uh we would fight for that , really . uh but since uh u u n u at least our experience is that only endpointing a a mel cepstrum gets uh gets you twenty - one percent improvement overall and twenty - seven improvement on speechdat - car",15,0.5,0.08175045996904373
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.09142225235700607
0,0,then obvious the database uh i mean the the the uh the baseline will go up . and nobody can then achieve fifty percent improvement .,15,0.5,0.0792977586388588
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.07904026657342911
0,0,so they agreed that uh there will be a twenty - five percent improvement required on on uh h u m bad mis badly mismatched,15,0.5,0.09317973256111145
0,0,"but wait a minute , i thought the endpointing really only helped in the noisy cases .",15,0.5,0.08657343685626984

0,0,"oh , but you still have that with the mfcc .",15,0.5,0.08975078165531158

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07239175587892532
0,0,yeah but you have the same prob i mean mfcc basically has an enormous number of uh insertions .,15,0.5,0.08811312168836594
0,0,yeah . right . yeah . yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.09929938614368439

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.07155430316925049
0,0,"and uh and they almost agreed on that except that it was n't a hundred percent agreed . and so last time uh during the meeting , i just uh brought up the issue , i said `` well you know uh quite frankly i 'm surprised how lightly you are making these decisions because this is a major decision . for two years we are fighting for fifty percent improvement and suddenly you are saying `` oh no we we will do something less `` , but maybe we should discuss that . and everybody said `` oh we discussed that and you were not a mee there `` and i said `` well a lot of other people were not there because not everybody participates at these teleconferencing c things . `` then they said `` oh no no no because uh everybody is invited . `` however , there is only ten or fifteen lines , so people ca n't even con you know participate . so eh they agreed , and so they said `` ok , we will discuss that . `` immediately nokia uh raised the question and they said `` oh yeah we agree this is not good to to uh dissolve the uh uh the uh the criterion . ``",15,0.5,0.07869800925254822

0,0,"yeah , that 's what that 's a g very good uh point , because david says `` well you know we ca we can manipulate this number by choosing the right weights anyways . `` so while you are right but uh you know but",15,0.5,0.06611869484186172

0,0,"well , of course people will not like it . now what is happening now is that i th i think that people try to match the criterion to solution .",15,0.5,0.14313921332359314
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10389537364244461
0,0,they have solution . now they want to make sure their criterion is,15,0.5,0.13656733930110931
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08317897468805313
0,0,and i think that this is not the right way .,15,0.5,0.11188504844903946
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10262477397918701
0,0,uh it may be that that eventually it may ha may ha it may have to happen . but it 's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could .,15,0.5,0.07972695678472519

0,0,"basically , i think that that this test was a little bit bogus because of the data and uh essentially there were these arbitrary decisions made , and and everything . so , so so this is so this is where it is . so what we are doing at ogi now is uh uh uh working basically on our parts which we i think a little bit neglected , like noise separation . uh so we are looking in ways is in uh which uh with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically , which would be a l uh , f more robust to noise , and so far not much uh success .",15,0.5,0.07287277281284332

0,0,yeah . yeah . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08124101907014847

0,0,"but i mean is the is the critical band the right uh uh dimension ? so we somehow made arbitrary decision , `` yes `` . then but then now we are thinking a lot how to uh how to use at least the neighboring band because that seems to be happening this i somehow start to believe that 's what 's happening in recognition . cuz a lot of experiments point to the fact that people can split the signal into critical bands , but then oh uh uh so you can you are quite capable of processing a signal in uh uh independently in individual critical bands . that 's what masking experiments tell you . but at the same time you most likely pay attention to at least neighboring bands when you are making any decisions , you compare what 's happening in in this band to what 's happening to the band to to to the to the neighboring bands . and that 's how you make uh decisions . that 's why the articulatory events , which uh f f fletcher talks about , they are about two critical bands . you need at least two , basically . you need some relative , relative relation .",15,0.5,0.0991789922118187

0,0,yep . sure . go ahead .,15,0.5,0.10675937682390213
0,0,and so so so for instance if you d if you a if you add the noise that normally masks masks the uh the the signal right ?,15,0.5,0.13008742034435272
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.178444966673851
0,0,"and you can show that in that if the if you add the noise outside the critical band , that does n't affect the the decisions you 're making about a signal within a critical band .",15,0.5,0.10642386972904205
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.12112424522638321
0,0,"unless this noise is modulated . if the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band , the amount of masking is less . the moment you moment you provide the noise in n neighboring critical bands .",15,0.5,0.11348961293697357
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.222226083278656
0,0,"so the s m masking curve , normally it looks like sort of i start from from here , so you { comment } you have uh no noise then you you you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching is increasing . and when you e hit a certain point , which is a critical band , then the amount of masking is the same .",15,0.5,0.1231493130326271
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.1411677598953247

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10730695724487305
0,0,"but , if you if you if you modulate the noise , the masking goes up and the moment you start hitting the another critical band , the masking goes down . so essentially essentially that 's a very clear indication that that that cognition can take uh uh into consideration what 's happening in the neighboring bands . but if you go too far in a in a if you if the noise is very broad , you are not increasing much more , so so if you if you are far away from the signal uh from the signal f uh the frequency at which the signal is , then the m even the when the noise is co - modulated it it 's not helping you much .",15,0.5,0.08850938826799393

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12819407880306244

0,0,"well , that 's yeah . so",15,0.5,0.11061496287584305
0,0,"i also have the feeling that um , the reason ye why it does n't work is yeah , that the models are much are t um , not complex enough . because i actually i als always had a good experience with spectral subtraction , just a straight spectral subtraction algorithm when i was using neural networks , big neural networks , which maybe are more able to model strange distributions and",15,0.5,0.07615359872579575

0,0,"hmm . yeah , y i i was whe w w just yesterday when i was thinking about it um w what what we could try to do , or do about it i mean , if you if you get at this in this situation that you get this this negative values and you simply set it to zero or to a constant or whatever if we if we would use there a somehow , um a random generator which which has a certain distribution , u not a certain { comment } yeah , a special distribution we should see we we have to think about it .",15,0.5,0.11731638759374619

0,0,"if we look at the france telecom proposal , they use some kind of noise addition . they have a random number generator , right ? and they add noise on the trajectory of , uh , the log energy only , right ?",15,0.5,0.09868460893630981
0,0,"oh , they do !",15,0.5,0.11412511020898819
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.10743493586778641

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.19196592271327972
0,0,so it it it it it is l somehow similar to what,15,0.5,0.1098385825753212
0,0,"i think because they have th log energy , yeah , and then just generate random number . they have some kind of mean and variance , and they add this number to to the log energy simply . um",15,0.5,0.14912845194339752
0,0,"yeah the the log energy , the after the clean cleaning up .",15,0.5,0.15891318023204803
0,0,to the l,15,0.5,0.11303330957889557
0,0,so they add a random random noise to it .,15,0.5,0.06235421448945999
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.16470342874526978
0,0,"to the just the energy , or to the mel uh , to the mel filter ?",15,0.5,0.15826934576034546
0,0,no . on - only to the log energy .,15,0.5,0.1359705924987793

0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.06295281648635864
0,0,"so it cuz i mean , i think this is most interesting for the mel filters . right ?",15,0.5,0.22222250699996948
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.09731439501047134
0,0,or or f f one or the other .,15,0.5,0.22027842700481415
0,0,but but they do not apply filtering of the log energy or what,15,0.5,0.11769922077655792
0,0,"like , uh i mean",15,0.5,0.04748661443591118
0,0,like like a spectral subtraction or,15,0.5,0.09472842514514923
0,0,no their filter is not m domain . s so they did filter their time signal,15,0.5,0.09559006989002228
0,0,yeah . i kn,15,0.5,0.1372634917497635
0,0,and then what @ @ u,15,0.5,0.13111354410648346
0,0,"and then they calculate from this , the log energy",15,0.5,0.11349692195653915
0,0,yeah then after that it is s almost the same as the baseline prop system .,15,0.5,0.07507060468196869
0,0,or ? mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11414024233818054
0,0,"and then the final log energy that they that they get , that to the to that they add some random noise .",15,0.5,0.17366981506347656
0,0,"yeah , but again , that 's just log energy as opposed to filter bank energy .",15,0.5,0.20615732669830322
0,0,yeah . so it 's not the mel .,15,0.5,0.12218519300222397

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.08400940150022507
0,0,"maybe it 's just a way to decrease the importance of this particular parameter in the in the world feature vector cu if you add noise to one of the parameters , you widen the distributions",15,0.5,0.07621342688798904

0,0,eee - sss - uh .,15,0.5,0.08107531070709229
0,0,so it could reduce the dependence on the amplitude and so on . yeah .,15,0.5,0.1293720006942749
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09674213081598282
0,0,yeah . although,15,0.5,0.1110081672668457
0,0,maybe .,15,0.5,0.08842406421899796

0,0,or ?,15,0.5,0.11092188954353333
0,0,"ok . so the other thing is the i 'm just looking at a little bit on the delay issue where the delay of the system is like a hundred and eighty millisecond . so i just just tried another sk system i mean , another filter which i 've like shown at the end . which is very similar to the existing uh , filter . only uh , only thing is that the phase is is like a totally nonlinear phase because it 's a it 's not a symmetric filter anymore .",15,0.5,0.06377910077571869
0,0,this is for the lda ?,15,0.5,0.10870497673749924
0,0,yeah so so this this is like so this makes the delay like zero for lda because it 's completely causal .,15,0.5,0.14553183317184448
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.16822369396686554
0,0,"so so i got actually just the results for the italian for that and that 's like so the fifty - one point o nine has become forty - eight point o six , which is like three percent relative degradation . so i have like the fifty - one point o nine",15,0.5,0.07501726597547531
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13671067357063293

0,0,but but is there is there a problem with the one hundred eighty milliseconds ? or ?,15,0.5,0.06286084651947021

0,0,"this is so so , basically our our position is that , um , we should n't be unduly constraining the latency at this point because we 're all still experimenting with trying to make the performance better in the presence of noise . uh , there is a minority in that group who is a arguing who are arguing for um , uh , having a further constraining of the latency . so we 're s just continuing to keep aware of what the trade - offs are and , you know , what what do we gain from having longer or shorter latencies ?",15,0.5,0.0808606967329979

0,0,what what was it ?,15,0.5,0.15977643430233002
0,0,it was thirty - five .,15,0.5,0.09029991924762726

0,0,you know ?,15,0.5,0.09456620365381241

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.11736389994621277
0,0,they did n't include that .,15,0.5,0.09579247981309891

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11362206935882568
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.15222936868667603
0,0,where does the comprish compression in decoding delay comes from ?,15,0.5,0.12954014539718628
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.15062209963798523
0,0,"that 's the way the the the frames are packed , like you have to wait for one more frame to pack . because it 's the crc is computed for two frames always .",15,0.5,0.10971911996603012
0,0,"well , that the they would need that forty milliseconds also .",15,0.5,0.06462467461824417
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12542667984962463
0,0,no . they actually changed the compression scheme altogether .,15,0.5,0.1194603368639946

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12467493116855621
0,0,so they have their own compression and decoding scheme and they i do n't know what they have .,15,0.5,0.16213764250278473
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.16054882109165192
0,0,"but they have coded zero delay for that . because they ch i know they changed it , their compression . they have their own crc , their their own error correction mechanism .",15,0.5,0.134003683924675
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.1681581437587738
0,0,so they do n't have to wait more than one more frame to know whether the current frame is in error .,15,0.5,0.09432146698236465
0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.10107352584600449

0,0,yeah . right .,15,0.5,0.08915256708860397
0,0,and you told me that there was a difference in how the normalization was done . and i was asking if you were going to do redo it uh for plp with the normalization done as it had been done for the mel cepstrum .,15,0.5,0.06636837869882584

0,0,"yeah , i agree , but i thought that the normalization difference was one of the possibilities ,",15,0.5,0.07830817252397537

0,0,"so that 's right . well , what i was gon na do is i was gon na take um a couple of the utterances that he had run through , then run them through again but modify the pruning threshold and see if it you know , affects the score .",15,0.5,0.11580995470285416

0,0,and,15,0.5,0.13434652984142303
0,0,so i i did n't think it would be that big a deal because i was figuring well you have it turned back so far that you know it,15,0.5,0.12419351190328598

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10151883959770203

0,0,and the idea is that the transcripts will that get stored as a master there 'll be a master transcript which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses .,15,0.5,0.12475346028804779

0,0,wh - what,15,0.5,0.06034752354025841
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.16734756529331207

0,0,what if you put it in but did n't put the boundaries ?,15,0.5,0.11966319382190704
0,0,"well , but",15,0.5,0.10702195018529892
0,0,"so you just know it 's between these other things ,",15,0.5,0.13046564161777496
0,0,"well , ok . so now there 's there 's another another possibility",15,0.5,0.1174246072769165
0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.14993895590305328
0,0,"which is , um , the time boundaries could mark off words { comment } from nonwords . and that would be extremely time - effective , if that 's sufficient .",15,0.5,0.1691553145647049
0,0,"yeah i mean i 'm think if it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , we are gon na be building up models for these things and these things are somewhat self - aligning , so if so , we i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a `` breath `` or a `` breath - in `` or `` breath - out `` , the models will learn that sort of thing . uh , so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are . so",15,0.5,0.13658852875232697
0,0,"ok . but that would maybe include a pause as well ,",15,0.5,0.1313004046678543
0,0,"well , there 's a there 's",15,0.5,0.09933055937290192

0,0,"yeah , i you know there is there 's this dynamic tension between between marking absolutely everything , as you know , and and and marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods . basically the more we can mark the better . but if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area , and this might be one like this although i i i 'd be interested to h get get input from liz and andreas on this to see if they cuz they 've - they 've got lots of experience with the breaths in in , uh , uh , their transcripts .",15,0.5,0.10409947484731674
0,0,they have lots of experience with breathing ?,15,0.5,0.09537294507026672
0,0,i,15,0.5,0.10685873031616211
0,0,"actually well , yes they do , but we we can handle that without them here . but but but , uh , you were gon na say something about",15,0.5,0.07980769872665405
0,0,"yeah , i i think , um , one possible way that we could handle it is that , um , you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gon na transcribe , u th they 're gon na transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot . if there 's a breath in there , they could transcribe that .",15,0.5,0.10507453978061676
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.10435616225004196
0,0,"that 's what they 've been doing . so , within an overlap segment , they they do this .",15,0.5,0.19375455379486084
0,0,"right . but right . but if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , um , do n't do n't worry about that .",15,0.5,0.06961344182491302
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12397398054599762
0,0,"so what we 're saying is , there 's no guarantee that , um so for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed . but outside of those boundaries , there could have been stuff that was n't transcribed . so you just somebody ca n't rely on that data and say `` that 's perfectly clean data `` . uh do you see what i 'm saying ?",15,0.5,0.09594474732875824
0,0,"yeah , you 're saying it 's uncharted territory .",15,0.5,0.10474938154220581
0,0,so i would say do n't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words .,15,0.5,0.12423468381166458
0,0,that sounds like a reasonable reasonable compromise .,15,0.5,0.07987570017576218
0,0,"yeah , and that 's that that quite co corresponds to the way i i try to train the speech - nonspeech detector , as i really try to not to detect those breaths which are not within a speech chunk but with which are just in in a silence region .",15,0.5,0.09541231393814087
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1422051042318344
0,0,and they so they hopefully wo n't be marked in in those channel - specific files .,15,0.5,0.11214958876371384
0,0,u i i wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes .,15,0.5,0.11157268285751343

0,0,"yeah , so",15,0.5,0.08552864193916321
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14859874546527863
0,0,"see , in a in a way this is a really key point , that for speech recognition , uh , research , uh , um , e a it 's not just a minor part . in fact , the i think i would say the core thing that we 're trying to do is to recognize the actual , meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful . so it 's critical it 's not just incidental it 's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful . because that 's what we 're trying to pull the other out of . that 's our problem . if we had nothing",15,0.5,0.14578938484191895
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08526062965393066
0,0,"if we had only linguistically - relevant things if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components , and , uh , we we did n't have noise , we did n't have convolutional errors , we did n't have extraneous , uh , behaviors , and so forth , and moving your head and all these sorts of things , then , actually speech recognition i i is n't that bad right now . i mean you can you know it 's it 's the technology 's come along pretty well .",15,0.5,0.08965258300304413
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1324177384376526
0,0,the the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart .,15,0.5,0.13961710035800934
0,0,"ok , fair enough . i guess , um , i uh , what i was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem ? because if it were likely that a pda would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing , so it would n't even have to be processed at thi at this computational le well , let me see , it 'd have to be computationally processed to get rid of it , but if there were , uh , like likely on the frontier , a good breath extractor then , um , and then you 'd have to",15,0.5,0.09964615106582642
0,0,"but that 's a research question , you know ? and so",15,0.5,0.10755361616611481
0,0,"yeah , well , see and that 's what i would n't know .",15,0.5,0.12111620604991913
0,0,"that and we do n't either . i mean so so the thing is it 's it right now it 's just raw d it 's just data that we 're collecting , and so we do n't wan na presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations because that 's actually the research that we 're trying to feed . so , you know , an and maybe maybe in five years it 'll work really well ,",15,0.5,0.13153588771820068
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07167612016201019
0,0,"and and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time , but then we would still want to account for that ten percent , so .",15,0.5,0.10252618044614792
0,0,"i guess there 's another aspect which is that as we 've improved our microphone technique , we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent , uh , recordings , so it 's in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the on the earlier ones .",15,0.5,0.11095938831567764
0,0,uh - huh . i see .,15,0.5,0.08856455981731415
0,0,"one of the um , just to add to this one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them . i mean , that 's what a lot of people do nowadays .",15,0.5,0.16425171494483948
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.07405564188957214
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.0878547877073288
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14555887877941132
0,0,"and so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked , so that you know where the boundaries are .",15,0.5,0.09487596154212952
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.09882790595293045
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1368086338043213
0,0,"so i mean , i do n't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation . we do n't have to go and search for them to to mark them at all , but , i mean , if they 're there while they 're transcribing some hunk of words , i 'd say put them in if possible .",15,0.5,0.12528887391090393
0,0,"ok , and it 's also the fact that they differ a lot from one channel to the other because of the way the microphone 's adjusted .",15,0.5,0.053273435682058334

0,1,"ok . so uh , uh , well , thanks for having me here , first of all . um , so maybe just a a little background on on my visit . so , uh , i 'm not really involved in any project , that 's uh that 's relevant to you uh , a at the moment , uh , the the reason is really for me uh , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . and and so i 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what i 'm working on , and um , i just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and and so i 'll be uh , happy to talk to you and and uh , i 'd also like to find out some more and and maybe i 'll just walk around the office and and then and ask some some questions , uh , in a couple days . so i 'll be here for uh , tomorrow and then uh , the remainder of uh , next week . ok , so , um , what i started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general . so um , uh what 's uh sort of the state of the art there is to um uh you have a bunch of of uh documents or learning units or learning objects , um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them . so there 's some international standards like the i - triple - e , uh there 's an i - triple - e , lon standard , and um , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have uh author information , you have uh , size information , format information and so on . uh , but they 're two uh fields that are um , more interesting . one is uh you store keywords associated with the uh with the document , and one is uh , you have sort of a , um , well , what is the document about ? so it 's some sort of taxonomic uh , ordering of of the of the units . now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses , uh you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used , and uh , i think that 's a that 's a very that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and uh as a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , science , biology , and then but that 's really all that we have at the moment . so i think there 's a huge , um , uh need for improvement there . now , what this uh a standard like this would give us is we could um , sort of uh with a search engine just query uh , different repositories all over the world . but we ca n't really um , so what i 'm what i try to do is um , to have um , uh so . so the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . now , what what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh , students um , try to u program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same problems , uh , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and so , what i want to build is basically a a smart f a q system . now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than `` i 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . `` so . and i think that i do n't need to tell you this . i 'm i 'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , uh , context it , and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . so , i want to be able to model information like , um , so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , um , what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's um , which um , which error message was encountered . so this sort of information i think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved . now , um , basically giving this um uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically , and that 's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again . and , using this and some some uh , knowledge about the domain i think you can do some some simple inferences . like you know that when somebody 's working about uh , working on on servlets for example , he 's using java , cuz servlets are used are written in java . so some some inferences like that , now , um , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of um off the documents you 're you 're searching against . so , uh what i wan na do is basically have some sort of um given these inputs , and then i can compute how many documents match , and use this as a metric in the search . now , what i plan to do is i want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results , and i want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um steepest descent approach . so if i knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? and and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this i could simply compute that , and find out which um which questions are worth um , asking . and that 's what i then propagate back to the user , and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . now , the big problem that i 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . and uh uh , so robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a bayesian network , which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . and so , uh what i 'm what i try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine uh , knowledge from very different sources , and and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with . trying to to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , um , what you can do with those . um . what i 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh , computational model . that that probably is n't expressive enough . so . so that 's another thing , um , which i think you 're also uh , uh looking into right now . and then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it it uses , or basically its view of the world , uh you can get very different results . so it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines . and there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach , where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , rather than going to some yahoo - like uh , search engine . so these are some of the just in a nutshell , some of the ideas . and i think a lot of the even though it 's a it 's a very different domain , but i think a lot of the , um , issues are are fairly similar . so . ok .",15,0.5,0.11407740414142609

0,0,"yeah , yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.12577712535858154
0,0,right ? so that 's not as good as the one up above .,15,0.5,0.11220354586839676
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.11256641894578934

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12441561371088028
0,0,so i 'm confused .,15,0.5,0.11325041949748993
0,0,"uh , actually the noise compensation whatever , uh , we are put in it works very well for the high mismatch condition . i mean , it 's consistent in the speechdat - car and in the clean training also it gives it but this fifty percent is is that the the high mismatch performance equivalent to the high mismatch performance in the speech .",15,0.5,0.08161995559930801
0,0,"so n s so since the high mismatch performance is much worse to begin with , it 's easier to get a better relative improvement .",15,0.5,0.11514563113451004
0,0,"yeah . yeah . i do . yeah , yeah . so by putting this noise",15,0.5,0.12380127608776093

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14818808436393738
0,0,"ok . um , and , um , the other thing , uh , which i 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit , which is that , um , uh , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting i had the other day when i was in spain with , uh , manolo pardo and javier , uh , ferreiros , who was here before , was , um , why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries . so , in what javier did before when they were doing , um h he was looking for , uh , speaker change points .",15,0.5,0.10164690762758255
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09751494228839874
0,0,"um . as a simplification , he originally did this only using silence as , uh , a putative , uh , speaker change point .",15,0.5,0.06768466532230377
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.18815848231315613
0,0,"and , uh , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp uh , phonetic class , for instance . and for broadcast news , that was fine . here obviously it 's not .",15,0.5,0.10946609079837799
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08331580460071564
0,0,"and , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um , w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue , uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before",15,0.5,0.10413309186697006
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08537792414426804
0,0,"and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also ?",15,0.5,0.13141675293445587
0,0,"nnn , yeah .",15,0.5,0.15504825115203857
0,0,"so then you 've got you already have the super - structure with gaussians and h - you know , simple h m ms and so forth . and you you might so there was a there was a little bit of a a a a difference of opinion because i i thought that it was it 's interesting to look at what features are useful .",15,0.5,0.10107366740703583

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1482650339603424

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1307554543018341

0,0,"yeah . uh , yeah . that that was one one one thing , uh , why i added more mixtures for for the speech . so i saw that there were loud loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers .",15,0.5,0.10976507514715195
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1322704404592514
0,0,"and so i did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers .",15,0.5,0.11733148992061615
0,0,"and did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet , or did you just ?",15,0.5,0.09964822232723236
0,0,i did that for for five minutes of one dialogue,15,0.5,0.05764906853437424
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.16361986100673676

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.07875189185142517

0,0,"yeah . you can specify the minimum length of speech or and silence portions which you want . and so i did some some modifications in those parameters , basically changing the minimum minimum length for s for silence to have , er to have , um yeah to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted . so .",15,0.5,0.18480771780014038

0,0,but,15,0.5,0.13197600841522217
0,0,that 's true . but it it saves so much time the the transcribers,15,0.5,0.1364498883485794
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.1080562174320221

0,0,"ok . so , um , um , i spoke i had a meeting with dave gelbart on on and he had , uh , excellent ideas on how the interface could be modified to to do this kind of representation . but , um , he in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already , um , existing interfaces which might already have these properties . so , do you wan na say something about that ?",15,0.5,0.1432552933692932
0,0,"yes . um , i talked with , uh , munich guys from from ludwi - ludwig maximilians university , who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations .",15,0.5,0.07142402231693268

0,0,excuse me .,15,0.5,0.13889853656291962

0,0,under windows .,15,0.5,0.09424328058958054

0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.09875109046697617
0,0,"i also wanted to be sure i mean , i 've i 've seen the this this is called praat , praat , which i guess means spee speech in dutch or something .",15,0.5,0.09246300160884857
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.11931080371141434
0,0,"yeah , but then i 'm not sure that 's the right thing for us .",15,0.5,0.24285978078842163

0,0,oh ! i see .,15,0.5,0.09298957139253616
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.0969248116016388
0,0,"oh , i see . so praat may not be",15,0.5,0.1079663559794426
0,0,that 's not praat . it 's called `` trans transedit `` i think .,15,0.5,0.05831402167677879
0,0,it 's a different one .,15,0.5,0.05470303073525429

0,0,"i see . oh , i see . ok . ok . alright .",15,0.5,0.09602780640125275
0,0,"the other thing , uh , to keep in mind , uh i mean , we 've been very concerned to get all this rolling so that we would actually have data ,",15,0.5,0.06420934200286865
0,0,"mmm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.14690391719341278

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1312851905822754
0,0,"and ultimately that path will be smoothed out . so i do n't know if we have a long - term need to do lots and lots of transcribing . i think we had a very quick need to get something out and we 'd like to be able to do some later because just it 's inter it 's interesting . but as far a you know , uh , with with any luck we 'll be able to wind down the larger project .",15,0.5,0.1550348699092865
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.09384854882955551
0,0,but you s,15,0.5,0.09611575305461884
0,0,what our decision was is that we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps .,15,0.5,0.10734225064516068
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.06553572416305542
0,0,right . yeah .,15,0.5,0.11149638891220093
0,0,and and do what we can later to clean that up if we need to .,15,0.5,0.08872317522764206

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11667843163013458
0,0,"and and i was just thinking that , um , if it were possible to bring that in , like , you know , this week , then when they 're encoding the overlaps it would be nice for them to be able to specify when you know , the start points and end points of overlaps .",15,0.5,0.14221961796283722
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.0753210186958313
0,0,uh th - they 're making really quick progress .,15,0.5,0.15751604735851288
0,0,yeah . that 's great .,15,0.5,0.15331436693668365
0,0,"and , um , so my my goal was w m my charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month . and it 'll be i 'm i 'm i 'm clear that we 'll be able to do that .",15,0.5,0.09809541702270508
0,0,that 's great .,15,0.5,0.14012549817562103

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15757142007350922
0,0,"i sent it to , um who did i send that to ? i sent it to a list and i thought i sent it to the e to the local list .",15,0.5,0.15152449905872345

0,0,"you saw that ? so brian did tell me that in fact what you said , that , uh that our that they are making progress and that he 's going that they 're going he 's gon na check the f the output of the first transcription and and",15,0.5,0.1540185511112213
0,0,"i mean , basically it 's it 's all the difference in the world . i mean , basically he 's he 's on it now .",15,0.5,0.13929621875286102
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.07854736596345901
0,0,"oh , that 's this is a new development .",15,0.5,0.09748630225658417
0,0,so so so this is so i it 'll happen .,15,0.5,0.09820786863565445
0,0,ok . super . super . ok . great .,15,0.5,0.09309512376785278
0,0,"yeah . i mean , basically it 's just saying that one of our one of our best people is on it ,",15,0.5,0.1044912040233612
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10897752642631531
0,0,"you know , who just does n't happen to be here anymore . someone else pays him . so",15,0.5,0.13865473866462708
0,0,"but about the need for transcription ,",15,0.5,0.19674207270145416
0,0,is n't that great ?,15,0.5,0.10101059079170227
0,0,"i mean , do n't we did n't we previously decide that the ibm transcripts would have to be checked anyway and possibly augmented ?",15,0.5,0.10711845010519028
0,0,so . yeah .,15,0.5,0.06180518493056297
0,0,yes . that 's true .,15,0.5,0.08031260967254639
0,0,"so , i think having a good tool is worth something no matter what .",15,0.5,0.07739335298538208
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13434448838233948
0,0,yeah . s ok . that 's that 's a good point .,15,0.5,0.0845765471458435
0,0,"yeah , and dave gelbart did volunteer ,",15,0.5,0.1410197913646698
0,0,good .,15,0.5,0.12537693977355957
0,0,"and since he 's not here , i 'll repeat it to at least modify transcriber , which , if we do n't have something else that works , i think that 's a pretty good way of going .",15,0.5,0.11166372895240784
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.08309601992368698
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12459764629602432
0,0,"and we discussed on some methods to do it . my approach originally , and i 've already hacked on it a little bit it was too slow because i was trying to display all the waveforms . but he pointed out that you do n't really have to . i think that 's a good point .",15,0.5,0.10314680635929108
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09022460877895355
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14388684928417206
0,0,"that if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channels , that 's perfectly sufficient .",15,0.5,0.0924171581864357
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.14355330169200897
0,0,"yeah , exactly . and just keep those things separate . and and , um , dan ellis 's hack already allows them to be able to display different waveforms to clarify overlaps and things ,",15,0.5,0.1411319226026535
0,0,"no . they can only display one ,",15,0.5,0.1060057058930397
0,0,so that 's already,15,0.5,0.07411979883909225
0,0,but they can listen to different ones .,15,0.5,0.06088513880968094
0,0,"oh , yes , but well , uh , yes , but what i mean is that , uh , from the transcriber 's perspective , uh , those two functions are separate . and dan ellis 's hack handles the , um , choice the ability to choose different waveforms from moment to moment .",15,0.5,0.12444939464330673
0,0,"but only to listen to , not to look at .",15,0.5,0.1050357073545456
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1294841766357422
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.1430961936712265
0,0,the waveform you 're looking at does n't change .,15,0.5,0.11503943055868149
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11849794536828995
0,0,that 's true .,15,0.5,0.0900690034031868

0,0,"so , anyway , i can talk about digits . um , did everyone get the results or shall i go over them again ? i mean that it was basically the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well . um , and in retrospect that 's not as surprising as maybe i it should n't have been as surprising as i as as i felt it was . the lapel mike is a very high - quality microphone . and as morgan pointed out , that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling if no one else is talking .",15,0.5,0.10874273627996445

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14618666470050812

0,0,it 's g it,15,0.5,0.08396709710359573
0,0,or the cross - talk . yeah .,15,0.5,0.1344405710697174
0,0,"the lapel is typically worse on the on clothes rustling , but if no one 's rustling their clothes ,",15,0.5,0.21503905951976776
0,0,"right . i mean , a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits ,",15,0.5,0.18308216333389282
0,0,it 's it 's,15,0.5,0.10421687364578247
0,0,so it 's it 's a very different task than sort of the natural .,15,0.5,0.1262645572423935
0,0,"yeah . you do n't move much during reading digits , i think .",15,0.5,0.0821474939584732

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1307394802570343
0,0,"right . so in the digits , in most most cases , there were n't other people talking .",15,0.5,0.12692329287528992
0,0,right . right .,15,0.5,0.06955939531326294

0,0,"there typically do n't , no .",15,0.5,0.12786641716957092

0,0,"they have a little bit ,",15,0.5,0.1035386323928833
0,0,and then it would,15,0.5,0.11284440010786057
0,0,"but they 're not noise - cancelling . so , uh",15,0.5,0.09604533761739731
0,0,they 're they 're intended to be omni - directional .,15,0.5,0.0844331905245781

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11582205444574356

0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.12257514894008636
0,0,"and and it was uh , i mean , there the point of interest to the group was primarily that , um , the , uh the system that we had that was based on h t k , that 's used by , you know , all the participants in aurora , was so much worse than the than the s r",15,0.5,0.17647403478622437

0,0,"or if you did , i did n't include them , cuz it was",15,0.5,0.12098947912454605
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.07771967351436615
0,0,"yeah , i think i did , actually . so there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation .",15,0.5,0.07691075652837753

0,0,"um . a a a couple percent or some i mean well , i do n't know it overall uh , i i do n't remember , but there was there was a significant , um , loss or win { comment } from adaptation with with adaptation . and , um , that was the phone - loop adaptation . and then there was a very small like point one percent on the natives uh , win from doing , um , you know , adaptation to the recognition hypotheses . and i tried both means adaptation and means and variances , and the variances added another or subtracted another point one percent . so , it 's , um that 's the number there . point six , i believe , is what you get with both , uh , means and variance adaptation .",15,0.5,0.08287297934293747

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13016614317893982

0,0,"yeah , bu although i 'd be i think it 'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system so that these numbers were comparable",15,0.5,0.08919142931699753
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12321870028972626
0,0,and try it out on ti - digits .,15,0.5,0.1727074682712555
0,0,"well , adam knows how to run it ,",15,0.5,0.07085207849740982
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08947958797216415
0,0,yeah . no problem .,15,0.5,0.09367965161800385
0,0,so you just make a f,15,0.5,0.11855204403400421
0,0,"yeah . yeah . cuz our sense from the other from the aurora , uh , task is that",15,0.5,0.14433683454990387
0,0,and try it with ti - digits ?,15,0.5,0.1015222817659378
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10583575814962387
0,0,"i mean , cuz we were getting sub one percent numbers on ti - digits also with the tandem thing .",15,0.5,0.13138365745544434
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1122916117310524
0,0,"so , one so there were a number of things we noted from this .",15,0.5,0.14945094287395477
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.13446712493896484
0,0,"one is , yeah , the sri system is a lot better than the htk",15,0.5,0.09595367312431335
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.11564011871814728
0,0,"this , you know , very limited training htk system .",15,0.5,0.10023509711027145
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10104995965957642
0,0,"uh , but the other is that , um , the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the studio - recording ti - digits . i think , you know , one reason for that , uh , might be that there 's still even though it 's close - talking , there still is some noise and some room acoustics .",15,0.5,0.09982217103242874
0,0,mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.23911114037036896
0,0,"and another might be that , uh , i 'd i would presume that in the studio , uh , uh , situation recording read speech that if somebody did something a little funny or n pronounced something a little funny or made a little that they did n't include it ,",15,0.5,0.16790568828582764
0,0,they did n't include it .,15,0.5,0.08690830320119858
0,0,they made them do it again .,15,0.5,0.07409505546092987
0,0,"whereas , i took out the ones that i noticed that were blatant that were correctable .",15,0.5,0.06188910827040672
0,0,mmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.16558820009231567
0,0,"so that , if someone just read the wrong digit , i corrected it .",15,0.5,0.09877117723226547
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1837473064661026
0,0,and then there was another one where jose could n't tell whether i could n't tell whether he was saying zero or six . and i asked him and he could n't tell either .,15,0.5,0.09316696226596832
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.15570586919784546
0,0,so i just cut it out .,15,0.5,0.08994841575622559
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1579347550868988
0,0,"you know , so i just e edited out the first , i uh , word of the utterance . um , so there 's a little bit of correction but it 's definitely not as clean as ti - digits . so my expectations is ti - digits would , especially i think ti - digits is all american english .",15,0.5,0.14073100686073303
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14389753341674805
0,0,"right ? so it would probably do even a little better still on the sri system , but we could give it a try .",15,0.5,0.0863567665219307
0,0,"well . but remember , we 're using a telephone bandwidth front - end here , uh , on this , uh on this sri system , so , um , i was i thought that maybe that 's actually a good thing because it it gets rid of some of the uh , the noises , um , you know , in the the below and above the um , the , you know , speech bandwidth",15,0.5,0.07410665601491928
0,0,mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.21082493662834167
0,0,"and , um , i suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher - quality recordings you would have to in fact , uh , use models that , uh , were trained on wider - band data . and of course we ca n't do that or",15,0.5,0.1690906584262848
0,0,wha - what 's ti - digits ? i thought t,15,0.5,0.09899497777223587
0,0,"it 's wide - band , yeah . it 's in in fact , we looked it up",15,0.5,0.1650863140821457
0,0,it is wide - band . ok .,15,0.5,0.0881146788597107
0,0,and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling .,15,0.5,0.10342611372470856
0,0,"oh , that 's right . i i did look that up .",15,0.5,0.12152550369501114
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.16821086406707764
0,0,i could n't remember whether that was ti - digits or one of the other digit tasks .,15,0.5,0.1323871910572052
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10687526315450668
0,0,"right . but but , i would yeah . it 's it 's easy enough to try , just run it on",15,0.5,0.09018956124782562
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08620957285165787
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13167493045330048
0,0,see w,15,0.5,0.08762121945619583
0,0,"so , morgan , you 're getting a little breath noise .",15,0.5,0.1116233840584755
0,0,"now , eh , does",15,0.5,0.18912145495414734
0,0,you might wan na move the mike down a little bit .,15,0.5,0.12126516550779343
0,0,"one one issue one issue with with that is that um , the system has this , uh , notion of a speaker to which is used in adaptation , variance norm uh , you know , both in , uh , mean and variance normalization and also in the vtl estimation .",15,0.5,0.08377339690923691
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12941952049732208
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.10959155857563019
0,0,"yeah , i noticed the script that extracted it .",15,0.5,0.13613231480121613
0,0,"do y ? is ? so does so th so does does , um , the ti - digits database have speakers that are known ?",15,0.5,0.0987643152475357
0,0,yep . yep .,15,0.5,0.12935620546340942
0,0,and is there is there enough data or a comparable comparable amount of data to to what we have in our recordings here ?,15,0.5,0.2332097291946411
0,0,"that i do n't know . i do n't know . i do n't know how many speakers there are ,",15,0.5,0.0564386248588562
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14976216852664948
0,0,and and how many speakers per utterance .,15,0.5,0.09993487596511841
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08326458930969238
0,0,"well , the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation . that would",15,0.5,0.12399355322122574
0,0,"right . uh , but i 'm not so much worried about the adaptation , actually , than than the , um , um the , uh , vtl estimation .",15,0.5,0.09197124093770981
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.20533815026283264
0,0,"if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the the warping , uh , factor . so , um",15,0.5,0.14231427013874054
0,0,"i strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do . so , uh",15,0.5,0.1145721897482872
0,0,"right . but it 's not the amount of speakers , it 's the num it 's the amount of data per speaker .",15,0.5,0.11403763294219971
0,0,right . so we we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent .,15,0.5,0.090280681848526
0,0,right . right .,15,0.5,0.13678233325481415
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.14084206521511078
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.15693634748458862
0,0,"so , although i i sort of know how to run it , there are a little a f few details here and there that i 'll have to dig out .",15,0.5,0.13679085671901703
0,0,ok . the key so th the system actually extracts the speaker id from the waveform names .,15,0.5,0.07405287027359009
0,0,right . i saw that .,15,0.5,0.1319039762020111
0,0,"and there 's a there 's a script and that is actually all in one script . so there 's this one script that parses waveform names and extracts things like the , um , speaker , uh , id or something that can stand in as a speaker id . so , we might have to modify that script to recognize the , um , speakers , um , in the in the , uh , um , ti - digits database .",15,0.5,0.09779763221740723
0,0,"right . right . and that , uh",15,0.5,0.08534210920333862
0,0,or you can fake you can fake names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the for the meetings .,15,0.5,0.15032334625720978
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11862222850322723
0,0,"that would be the , sort of probably the safest way to do",15,0.5,0.1504511535167694
0,0,i might have to do that anyway to to do because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right .,15,0.5,0.09349749237298965
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.14856253564357758
0,0,"the other thing is , is n't ti - digits isolated digits ?",15,0.5,0.23054584860801697
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.1646878570318222
0,0,"or is that another one ? i 'm i looked through a bunch of the digits t corp corpora , and now they 're all blurring .",15,0.5,0.13659311830997467
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1682330071926117
0,0,cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit . and then others were connected digits .,15,0.5,0.2290964126586914
0,0,"yeah . most of ti - digits is connected digits , i think .",15,0.5,0.1315339356660843
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09451036900281906
0,0,"the i mean , we had a bellcore corpus that we were using . it was that 's that was isolated digits .",15,0.5,0.18852560222148895
0,0,maybe it 's the bell gram . bell digits . alright .,15,0.5,0.2227281630039215
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.17771460115909576
0,0,"by the way , i think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr improve them by , um , not starting with the switchboard models but by taking the switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting .",15,0.5,0.12669283151626587
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.11359935253858566
0,0,"because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics and f for the far - field microphones , you know , to the noise . and that should really improve things , um , further . and then you use those adapted models , which are not speaker adapted but sort of acous you know , channel adapted",15,0.5,0.19493521749973297
0,0,channel adapted .,15,0.5,0.11991520971059799
0,0,use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation .,15,0.5,0.15969334542751312
0,0,"yeah . but the thing is , uh i mean , w when you it depends whether you 're ju were just using this as a a starter task for you know , to get things going for conversational or if we 're really interested i in connected digits . and i i think the answer is both . and for for connected digits over the telephone you do n't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation",15,0.5,0.13009628653526306
0,0,"well , i do n't know .",15,0.5,0.12351012229919434
0,0,"because somebody gets on the phone and says a number and then you just want it . you do n't do n't , uh",15,0.5,0.10861658304929733
0,0,this is this that one 's better .,15,0.5,0.10340341925621033
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.07538826763629913
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09031850844621658
0,0,"um , but , you know , i uh , my impression was that you were actually interested in the far - field microphone , uh , problem , i mean . so , you want to you want to that 's the obvious thing to try .",15,0.5,0.09241687506437302
0,0,oh . oh .,15,0.5,0.11632270365953445
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.0709242969751358
0,0,"right ? then , eh because you you do n't have any",15,0.5,0.09448888152837753
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12801483273506165
0,0,that 's where the most m acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the the r the set up here .,15,0.5,0.08518949151039124
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08543829619884491
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.10659852623939514
0,0,yeah . so that 'd be anoth another interesting data point .,15,0.5,0.08271327614784241
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1109059676527977
0,0,"i mean , i i guess i 'm saying i do n't know if we 'd want to do that as the as",15,0.5,0.10052209347486496
0,0,other way .,15,0.5,0.126522958278656

0,0,it f it clips over your ears .,15,0.5,0.10718809813261032
0,0,alright . this way .,15,0.5,0.12451092898845673
0,0,there you go .,15,0.5,0.11077426373958588

0,0,i 'll get it .,15,0.5,0.0964977890253067

0,0,it is ?,15,0.5,0.10530348122119904
0,0,i do n't know if we wan na use that as the,15,0.5,0.08207790553569794
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1021781638264656

0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.07589397579431534
0,0,so if you see the picture,15,0.5,0.15026463568210602
0,0,it it like this .,15,0.5,0.11116989701986313
0,0,i i,15,0.5,0.09519346058368683
0,0,and then you have to scr,15,0.5,0.108831487596035
0,0,i i already adjusted this a number of times .,15,0.5,0.11655250191688538

0,0,"ca n't quite seem to yeah , i think this contraption around your head is not working so well .",15,0.5,0.1554858535528183
0,0,"too many adju too many adjustments . yeah . anyway , what i was saying is that i i think i probably would n't want to see that as sort of like the norm , that we compared all things to .",15,0.5,0.20923538506031036
0,0,that looks good . yeah .,15,0.5,0.07917526364326477
0,0,"to , uh , the to have have all this ad all this , uh , adaptation . but i think it 's an important data point , if you 're if yeah .",15,0.5,0.08980632573366165
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.06494510173797607
0,0,"um . the other thing that that , uh of course , what barry was looking at was was just that , the near versus far . and , yeah , the adaptation would get th some of that .",15,0.5,0.09743595123291016
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13613544404506683
0,0,"but , i think even even if there was , uh , only a factor of two or something , like i was saying in the email , i think that 's that 's a big factor . so",15,0.5,0.13000784814357758

0,0,it 's this thing 's this is too big for my head .,15,0.5,0.1165916919708252

0,0,"so the to get that , uh , pivoted this way , it pivots like this .",15,0.5,0.07914233952760696
0,0,no this way . yeah .,15,0.5,0.13602331280708313
0,0,yeah . there you go .,15,0.5,0.10555952787399292
0,0,and there 's a screw that you can tighten .,15,0.5,0.09506402164697647

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.09770800173282623

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11086113005876541

0,0,"will you get the door , and ?",15,0.5,0.13061794638633728
0,0,"ok , so um .",15,0.5,0.12710417807102203
0,0,"ok . you collected an agenda , huh ?",15,0.5,0.08423397690057755
0,0,i did collect an agenda . so i 'm gon na go first . mwa - ha - ha ! it should n't take too long .,15,0.5,0.15080426633358002
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15185320377349854
0,0,"um , so we 're pretty much out of digits . we 've gone once through the set . um , so the only thing i have to do",15,0.5,0.13243043422698975
0,0,no there 's only ten .,15,0.5,0.10499753057956696
0,0,"yeah , that 's right . so i i just have to go through them",15,0.5,0.10181012004613876
0,0,"well , ok .",15,0.5,0.12478920817375183
0,0,"and uh pick out the ones that have problems , and either correct them or have them re - read . so we probably have like four or five more forms to be read , to be once through the set . i 've also extracted out about an hour 's worth . we have about two hours worth . i extracted out about an hour 's worth which are the f digits with for which whose speaker have speaker forms , have filled out speaker forms . not everyone 's filled out a speaker form . so i extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms and for meetings in which the `` key `` file and the transcript files are parsable . some of the early key files , it looks like , were done by hand , and so they 're not automatically parsable and i have to go back and fix those . so what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with . um , liz",15,0.5,0.10850873589515686

0,0,"so it 's just a question of a little hand - editing of some files and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms . i have this web - based speaker form , and i sent mail to everyone who had n't filled out a speaker form , and they 're slowly s trickling in .",15,0.5,0.11182361096143723

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11324071884155273
0,0,do n't think that 'd be that hard to read them as single digits .,15,0.5,0.13583610951900482
0,0,i agree .,15,0.5,0.1583116352558136

0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.13211560249328613
0,0,it 's a little bit better for me too because the digits are easier to recognize . they 're better trained than the numbers .,15,0.5,0.2893572151660919

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10464005172252655
0,0,i mean for it 's,15,0.5,0.10449113696813583
0,0,"no , no , i guess what i 'm saying is that",15,0.5,0.09530304372310638
0,0,just let them read it how they read it .,15,0.5,0.11760106682777405
0,0,to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have .,15,0.5,0.1408521831035614
0,0,right . well that 's fine with me as long as it 's just that i did n't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits .,15,0.5,0.1589769423007965
0,0,yeah . we can go back to the other thing later .,15,0.5,0.11834388226270676
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.14391356706619263
0,0,i mean we s we we 've we can do this for awhile,15,0.5,0.10681568086147308
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09411077201366425
0,0,"and then go back to digits for awhile , or um . do yo i mean , do you want do you want this do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ?",15,0.5,0.11480338871479034
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07938720285892487

0,0,"it 's actually unclear right now . i just thought well we 're if we 're collec collecting digits , and adam had said we were running out of the ti forms , i thought it 'd be nice to have them in groups , and probably , all else being equal , it 'd be better for me to just have single digits",15,0.5,0.11061838269233704
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1281370371580124

0,0,"ok , well if you pre",15,0.5,0.09747029840946198
0,0,"but if they make mistakes , it 's no big deal if the people say a hundred instead of `` one oo `` . and also w maybe we can just let them choose `` zero `` versus `` o `` as they as they like because even the same person c sometimes says `` o `` and sometimes says `` zero `` in different context ,",15,0.5,0.10702265799045563
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13102930784225464

0,0,ok so so i can just add to the instructions to read it as digits not as connected numbers .,15,0.5,0.0857715830206871
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.146442711353302

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.07379879802465439

0,0,the spaces already bias it toward being separated .,15,0.5,0.1356615573167801
0,0,it 's just easier to read .,15,0.5,0.10194109380245209
0,0,and i know i 'm gon na find this easier than words .,15,0.5,0.0866951271891594
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.06085563823580742

0,0,"but then we went back and forth on that . ok , so let 's give that a try",15,0.5,0.12102100998163223
0,0,ok . and is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ?,15,0.5,0.24305811524391174
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08837582916021347

0,0,let 's try it .,15,0.5,0.0945773497223854

0,0,i did mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12058431655168533

0,0,go ahead .,15,0.5,0.12561817467212677
0,0,"sorry , i i was just gon na say , so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of of recordings now . and you 're saying two hours , uh , is digits , so that 's roughly the ratio then ,",15,0.5,0.11419808864593506
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.11706716567277908
0,0,something like twenty twenty to one . which i guess makes makes sense . so if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this .,15,0.5,0.14019478857517242

0,0,"yeah , i also would like to argue for that cuz it it seems to me that , um , there 's a real strength in having the same test replicated in a whole bunch of times and adding to that basic test bank .",15,0.5,0.12971045076847076
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11932800710201263
0,0,"hmm ? cuz then you have , you know , more and more , u chances to get away from random errors . and i think , um , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups , and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having uh f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done , which were done by non - native speakers so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set , which is totally american speakers , and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database .",15,0.5,0.1567493975162506

0,0,ti - digits was ?,15,0.5,0.16088800132274628
0,0,i thought so .,15,0.5,0.08203434944152832
0,0,i thought i thought it was read .,15,0.5,0.09536364674568176
0,0,was it read ?,15,0.5,0.1258758157491684
0,0,"yeah , i think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be ogi .",15,0.5,0.120453841984272
0,0,"oh , i may well be .",15,0.5,0.07675984501838684

0,0,i have n't ever listened to ti - digits . so i do n't really know how it compares .,15,0.5,0.09533341228961945
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.12296339124441147
0,0,but but regardless it 's gon na it 's hard to compare cross - corpus .,15,0.5,0.16178180277347565

0,0,you said there 's like ten different groupings ?,15,0.5,0.16692548990249634

0,0,mm - hmm . are the patterns like are they based on anything or,15,0.5,0.12888120114803314

0,0,that would be interesting to see whether that helps .,15,0.5,0.08301035314798355

0,0,huh ?,15,0.5,0.05912797525525093
0,0,"i mean , even before you get the scatter plots , just looking at a single feature uh , looking at the distribution , is a good thing to do .",15,0.5,0.08830109983682632
0,0,yeah . catal - uh combining the different possibilities of uh the parameters . i i i i mean the the the scatter plot combining eh different n two combination .,15,0.5,0.0965002179145813

0,0,"i mean , let 's start with the before we get complicated , let 's start with the most basic wh thing , which is we 're arguing that if you take energy uh if you look at the energy , that , when two people are speaking at the same time , usually there 'll be more energy than when one is right ?",15,0.5,0.09759893268346786

0,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.08999230712652206
0,0,"and the first way you 'd look at that , uh s she 's , you know , absolutely right , is that you would just take a look at the distribution of those two things , much as you 've plotted them here ,",15,0.5,0.108957439661026
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11680895835161209

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12239258736371994
0,0,"well in this case you have three . you have the silence , and that that 's fine .",15,0.5,0.0849158838391304
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14767801761627197

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08511214703321457
0,0,"and then , given that as a base , you can see if that gets improved , you know , or or or worsened by the looking at regular energy , looking at log energy , we were just proposing that maybe it 's you know , it 's harder to see with the log energy , um and uh also these different normalizations , does a particular choice of normalization make it better ?",15,0.5,0.10507185012102127
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08875656872987747

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09906041622161865
0,0,um and then we w i think we 're agreed that pitch - related things are are are going to be a a really likely candidate to help .,15,0.5,0.09414467215538025
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12426533550024033
0,0,"yeah . i agree , yeah . uh - huh .",15,0.5,0.135299414396286
0,0,"um but since uh your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did in fact usually go up , when two people were talking , that 's eh you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which will match your intuition .",15,0.5,0.19866856932640076
0,0,"ok . yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.10108526796102524
0,0,"and she 's right , that a that having a having { comment } having this table , with a whole bunch of things , with the standard deviation , the variance and so forth , it 's it 's it 's harder to interpret than just looking at the the same kind of picture you have here .",15,0.5,0.16154012084007263

0,0,"um , i did some experim uh , uh , just a few more experiments before i had to , uh , go away for the w well , that week .",15,0.5,0.09049361944198608
0,0,great !,15,0.5,0.13810710608959198
0,0,"was it last week or whenever ? um , so what i was started playing with was the th again , this is the htk back - end . and , um , i was curious because the way that they train up the models , they go through about four sort of rounds of of training . and in the first round they do uh , i think it 's three iterations , and for the last three rounds e e they do seven iterations of re - estimation in each of those three . and so , you know , that 's part of what takes so long to train the the the back - end for this .",15,0.5,0.0968480259180069
0,0,"i 'm sorry , i did n't quite get that . there 's there 's four and there 's seven and i i 'm sorry .",15,0.5,0.0835685133934021
0,0,"yeah . uh , maybe i should write it on the board . so , there 's four rounds of training . um , i g i g i guess you could say iterations . the first one is three , then seven , seven , and seven . and what these numbers refer to is the number of times that the , uh , hmm re - estimation is run . it 's this program called h e",15,0.5,0.09375637024641037

0,0,"ok . so what happens is , um , at each one of these points , you increase the number of gaussians in the model .",15,0.5,0.12915951013565063
0,0,"yeah . oh , right ! this was the mix up stuff .",15,0.5,0.10509829968214035
0,0,yeah . the mix up .,15,0.5,0.08247106522321701

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10189124196767807
0,0,i remember now .,15,0.5,0.1203887090086937
0,0,"and so , in the final one here , you end up with , uh for all of the the digit words , you end up with , uh , three mixtures per state ,",15,0.5,0.09415163844823837
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10597174614667892

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08836442232131958
0,0,"but , um , uh , i wanted to first test to see if we actually need to do this many iterations early on .",15,0.5,0.08221247047185898
0,0,"uh , one , two ,",15,0.5,0.10487205535173416
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12556272745132446
0,0,"and so , um , i i ran a couple of experiments where i reduced that to l to be three , two , two , uh , five , i think , and i got almost the exact same results .",15,0.5,0.08120372146368027
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.2199941873550415

0,0,as opposed to ?,15,0.5,0.10778157413005829
0,0,good .,15,0.5,0.11684844642877579
0,0,"as opposed to wh what , sixteen hours or something like that ? i mean , it takes you have to do an overnight basically , the way it is set up now .",15,0.5,0.11122705042362213
0,0,yeah . it depends .,15,0.5,0.07989846169948578
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.0964340791106224
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11195878684520721
0,0,"so , uh , even we do n't do anything else , doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster .",15,0.5,0.1285952925682068
0,0,"and then when you have your final thing , do a full one , so it 's",15,0.5,0.16219407320022583
0,0,"and when you have your final thing , we go back to this .",15,0.5,0.12663348019123077
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12315667420625687
0,0,"so , um , and it 's a real simple change to make . i mean , it 's like one little text file you edit and change those numbers , and you do n't do anything else .",15,0.5,0.08778388053178787
0,0,"oh , this is a",15,0.5,0.0922091007232666
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10390745103359222
0,0,and then you just run .,15,0.5,0.10624897480010986
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.06880053132772446
0,0,so it 's a very simple change to make and it does n't seem to hurt all that much .,15,0.5,0.07487715780735016
0,0,"so you you run with three , two , two , five ? that 's a",15,0.5,0.13737130165100098
0,0,"so i uh , i i have to look to see what the exact numbers were .",15,0.5,0.09888719767332077
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11880314350128174
0,0,"i i thought was , like , three , two , two , five ,",15,0.5,0.08872789144515991
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13268442451953888
0,0,"but i i 'll i 'll double check . it was over a week ago that i did it ,",15,0.5,0.12264924496412277
0,0,ok . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12370848655700684

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.19174404442310333
0,0,"um , but it 's so much faster . i it makes a big difference .",15,0.5,0.12059507519006729
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.07557245343923569
0,0,so we could do a lot more experiments and throw a lot more stuff in there .,15,0.5,0.09177461266517639
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1273302286863327
0,0,that 's great .,15,0.5,0.12446150928735733
0,0,"um . oh , the other thing that i did was , um , i compiled the htk stuff for the linux boxes . so we have this big thing that we got from ibm , which is a five - processor machine . really fast , but it 's running linux . so , you can now run your experiments on that machine and you can run five at a time and it runs , uh , as fast as , you know , uh , five different machines .",15,0.5,0.0991932824254036

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.17240534722805023
0,0,"and so we 've got it now htk 's compiled for both the linux and for , um , the sparcs . um , you have to make you have to make sure that in your dot cshrc , um , it detects whether you 're running on the linux or a a sparc and points to the right executables . uh , and you may not have had that in your dot cshrc before , if you were always just running the sparc . so , um ,",15,0.5,0.13220901787281036

0,0,"uh , i can i can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work . but it 'll it really increases what we can run on .",15,0.5,0.0944889485836029
0,0,hmm . cool .,15,0.5,0.11702300608158112
0,0,"so , together with the fact that we 've got these faster linux boxes and that it takes less time to do these , um , we should be able to crank through a lot more experiments .",15,0.5,0.11503926664590836

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.1171659305691719
0,0,"so after i did that , then what i wanted to do { comment } was try increasing the number of mixtures , just to see , um see how how that affects performance .",15,0.5,0.11173450201749802
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09494325518608093
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.08476758748292923
0,0,"yeah . in fact , you could do something like keep exactly the same procedure and then add a fifth thing onto it",15,0.5,0.07648079097270966
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11817501485347748
0,0,that had more .,15,0.5,0.11074791848659515

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08861269801855087
0,0,right . right .,15,0.5,0.10050928592681885
0,0,"so at at the middle o where the arrows are showing , that 's you 're adding one more mixture per state ,",15,0.5,0.1432640105485916
0,0,"uh - huh . uh ,",15,0.5,0.08613818138837814
0,0,or ?,15,0.5,0.24935999512672424
0,0,"let 's see , uh . it goes from this uh , try to go it backwards this at this point it 's two mixtures per state . so this just adds one . except that , uh , actually for the silence model , it 's six mixtures per state .",15,0.5,0.10191651433706284
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09006562829017639

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1194017082452774

0,0,"might be between , uh , shared , uh shared variances or something ,",15,0.5,0.06384385377168655
0,0,yeah . i think that 's what it is .,15,0.5,0.13052751123905182
0,0,or,15,0.5,0.07730524241924286

0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.12196581810712814
0,0,"um , there because they start off with , uh , an initial model which is just this global model , and then they split it to the individuals . and so , it may be that that 's what 's happening here . i i i have to look it up and see . i i do n't exactly remember .",15,0.5,0.11183973401784897

0,0,"yeah . the , um yeah . and so well , this is a point . and right now actually there is a thing also , uh , that happens with the current weight is that a very non - significant improvement on the well - matched case result in huge differences in in the final number .",15,0.5,0.0945219174027443

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1231609433889389
0,0,"no , that is relative . but the question is , do you average the relative improvements or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ?",15,0.5,0.1033727154135704
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.09666565805673599
0,0,and the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings .,15,0.5,0.165627583861351
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.109164759516716
0,0,it 's a weighted average . um .,15,0.5,0.08464550971984863
0,0,"yeah . and so when you average the the relative improvement it tends to to give a lot of of , um , importance to the well - matched case because the baseline is already very good and , um , i it 's",15,0.5,0.08217364549636841
0,0,"why do n't they not look at improvements but just look at your av your scores ? you know , figure out how to combine the scores",15,0.5,0.09627580642700195

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13450105488300323

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.15154337882995605

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.10109423846006393
0,0,i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first and then do the,15,0.5,0.13348425924777985
0,0,combine error rates and then,15,0.5,0.1021784245967865

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10826469212770462

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.07301312685012817
0,0,"uh so the argument for that being the the the more important thing , is that you 're gon na try and do that , but you wan na see how badly it deviates from that when when when the , uh it 's a little different .",15,0.5,0.07510169595479965

0,0,"so you should weight those other conditions v very you know , really small .",15,0.5,0.11593162268400192
0,0,but no . that 's a that 's a that 's an arg,15,0.5,0.11025664955377579

0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.0863957405090332

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1353631466627121
0,0,i i i think that you could make the opposite argument that the well - matched case is a fantasy .,15,0.5,0.09976702183485031

0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.10761307924985886
0,0,"i think the thing is is that if you look at the well - matched case versus the po you know , the the medium and the and the fo and then the mismatched case , um , we 're seeing really , really big differences in performance . right ? and and y you would n't like that to be the case . you would n't like that as soon as you step outside you know , a lot of the the cases it 's is",15,0.5,0.237393319606781
0,0,"well , that 'll teach them to roll their window up .",15,0.5,0.09304840862751007
0,0,"i mean , in these cases , if you go from the the , uh i mean , i do n't remember the numbers right off , but if you if you go from the well - matched case to the medium , it 's not an enormous difference in the in the the training - testing situation , and and and it 's a really big performance drop .",15,0.5,0.07053927332162857
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08735622465610504
0,0,"you know , so , um yeah , i mean the reference one , for instance this is back old on , uh on italian uh , was like six percent error for the well - matched and eighteen for the medium - matched and sixty for the for highly - mismatched . uh , and , you know , with these other systems we we helped it out quite a bit , but still there 's there 's something like a factor of two or something between well - matched and medium - matched . and so i think that if what you 're if the goal of this is to come up with robust features , it does mean so you could argue , in fact , that the well - matched is something you should n't be looking at at all , that that the goal is to come up with features that will still give you reasonable performance , you know , with again gentle degregra degradation , um , even though the the testing condition is not the same as the training .",15,0.5,0.07702314853668213

0,0,"um , it 's yeah . medium mismatch is everything with the far microphone , but trained on , like , low noisy condition , like low speed and or stopped car and tested on high - speed conditions , i think , like on a highway and",15,0.5,0.06913116574287415
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11202333122491837
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.13409872353076935
0,0,"so it 's still the same same microphone in both cases ,",15,0.5,0.08685556799173355
0,0,same microphone but yeah .,15,0.5,0.10191378742456436
0,0,"but , uh , it 's there 's a mismatch between the car conditions . and that 's uh , you could argue that 's a pretty realistic situation",15,0.5,0.09606432169675827
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.0716632828116417
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10188298672437668

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14889203011989594

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1539233773946762
0,0,"um , so , u i since they have these three categories , it seems like the reasonable thing to do is to go across the languages and to come up with an improvement for each of those .",15,0.5,0.10940591245889664

0,0,um are you familiar with with the with the very rough setup of the data ?,15,0.5,0.0901133120059967
0,0,but i i imagine i 'll c just catch on .,15,0.5,0.07121829688549042

0,0,and then you could like um figure out what the cate,15,0.5,0.19357091188430786
0,0,"it 's a tourist information web site ,",15,0.5,0.08557082712650299
0,0,"uh , this is where they 're supposed to",15,0.5,0.050733331590890884
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.12230627983808517
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08538848161697388

0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.18036049604415894
0,0,the question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task .,15,0.5,0.15093424916267395
0,0,ok . ok . ok .,15,0.5,0.0907958447933197
0,0,"because what will happen then is that people repeat repeat , { comment } or as much as they can , of that phrasing .",15,0.5,0.11019640415906906
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.0688859075307846
0,0,"hmm . um , are you worried about being able to identify",15,0.5,0.11492683738470078
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12653027474880219
0,0,um . the the goals that we 've d you guys have been talking about are this these you know identifying which of three modes um their question uh concerns .,15,0.5,0.07461293786764145
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14241047203540802
0,0,so it 's like the enter versus view,15,0.5,0.16246116161346436
0,0,"yeah , we we we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction ,",15,0.5,0.13293345272541046
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.09983136504888535
0,0,"right ? that 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things",15,0.5,0.22694920003414154
0,0,uh - huh . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.17464368045330048
0,0,"and so th the q first question for the subject is , `` so these are things , you know , we thought a tourist can do . is there anything that interests you ? ``",15,0.5,0.1457960605621338
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11713887751102448
0,0,"and the person can say `` yeah , sure sh this is something i would do . i would go shopping `` . yeah ? and then we can sort of this s instructor can say `` well , uh then you you may want to find out how to get over here",15,0.5,0.14168207347393036

0,0,because this is where the shopping district is `` .,15,0.5,0.14205767214298248
0,0,so the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session ?,15,0.5,0.1493796706199646
0,0,"no . just sort of ok , what what what would you like to buy and then um ok there you wan na buy a whatever cuckoos clocks",15,0.5,0.07770489156246185
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09160976111888885
0,0,ok and the there is a store there .,15,0.5,0.0959673598408699
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.15883617103099823

0,0,"ok , that 's what i mean so like those tasks are all gon na be um unambiguous about which of the three modes .",15,0.5,0.09070191532373428
0,0,hopefully .,15,0.5,0.07331806421279907
0,0,right . ok . so .,15,0.5,0.08671996742486954
0,0,"well , so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words .",15,0.5,0.0756453350186348
0,0,hopefully .,15,0.5,0.08646538853645325

0,0,nuh ?,15,0.5,0.1634128987789154
0,0,so to to uh actually um uh specify the the tasks .,15,0.5,0.10544024407863617
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.06207228824496269

0,0,"yeah . we had exactly that on our list of possible way things so we uh i even made a sort of a silly thing how that could work , how you control you are here you you want to know how to get someplace , and this is the place and it 's a museum and you want to do some and and and there 's a person looking at pictures . so , you know , this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at pictures .",15,0.5,0.1453125774860382

0,0,"all the different actions , if at all possible , and also people will get caught up in the pictures . so all of a sudden we 'll get descriptions of pictures in there .",15,0.5,0.13177555799484253
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.12404823303222656
0,0,and people talking about pictures and pictorial representations,15,0.5,0.10789097845554352
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.13485652208328247

0,0,i would s i would still be willing to try it .,15,0.5,0.1273881196975708
0,0,"i mean , i i 'm i 'm not saying it 's necessary but but uh i uh uh i you might be able to combine you know text uh and and some sort of picture and also uh i think it it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task and then take the test away the the the the the text away",15,0.5,0.07229868322610855
0,0,mm - hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.12282603979110718
0,0,"so that they are not uh guided by by by what you wrote ,",15,0.5,0.11474243551492691
0,0,we will,15,0.5,0.09670931845903397
0,0,but can come up with their with their own,15,0.5,0.09641214460134506
0,0,"yeah , they will have no more linguistic matter in front of them when they enter this room .",15,0.5,0.08106089383363724
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08916845917701721
0,0,"ok . then i suggest we move on to the to we have um uh the edu project , let me make one more general remark , has sort of two two side uh um actions , its um action items that we 're do dealing with , one is modifying the smartkom parser and the other one is modifying the smartkom natural language generation module . and um this is not too complicated but i 'm just mentioning it put it in the framework because this is something we will talk about now . um , i have some news from the generation , do you have news from the parser ?",15,0.5,0.15051309764385223
0,0,"um , not",15,0.5,0.1789935827255249
0,0,by that look i,15,0.5,0.13969220221042633
0,0,"yes , uh , i would really p it would be better if i talked about it on friday .",15,0.5,0.10002195835113525
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08837560564279556
0,0,if that 's ok .,15,0.5,0.1210065558552742
0,0,"yeah , wonderful . um , did you run into problems or did you run into not h having time ?",15,0.5,0.14689868688583374
0,0,yeah . but not not any time part .,15,0.5,0.09118732064962387

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12125562876462936
0,0,"and um i i do have some good news for the natural language generation however . and the good news is i guess it 's done . uh , meaning that tilman becker , who does the german one , actually took out some time and already did it in english for us . and so the version he 's sending us is already producing the english that 's needed to get by in version one point one .",15,0.5,0.11569232493638992
0,0,so i take it that was similar to the what what we did for the parsing ?,15,0.5,0.09212532639503479
0,0,"yeah . i i it even though the generator is a little bit more complex and it would have been , not changing one hundred words but maybe four hundred words ,",15,0.5,0.07563047856092453

0,0,finals was that .,15,0.5,0.06739510595798492
0,0,yeah w it does n't really have much meaning to grad students but final projects might .,15,0.5,0.08671079576015472

0,0,no it 's just um you know they 're coming for us so that we can bug them,15,0.5,0.09251348674297333
0,0,ye,15,0.5,0.10166163742542267
0,0,and ask them more questions and sit down together and write sensible code and they can give some nice talks and stuff . but uh,15,0.5,0.12162012606859207

0,0,"i did n't look , uh , more closely . um . it might be , yeah . mm - hmm . um . well , eh , there is one thing that we can observe , is that the mean are more different for for c - zero and c - one than for the other coefficients . and yeah . and yeah , it the c - one is there are strange strange thing happening with c - one , is that when you have different kind of noises , the mean for the the silence portion is can be different . and",15,0.5,0.07311448454856873

0,0,r right .,15,0.5,0.13741286098957062
0,0,"but but i mean , when you the the hints that you get from what they when they talk about it are that they do they all do something like this .",15,0.5,0.14283351600170135
0,0,"right , ok . i see . bec - because i so this smartkom task first off , it 's this tv and movie information system .",15,0.5,0.09943678230047226
0,0,"yeah , but you might have somebody who 's using it",15,0.5,0.07612495869398117
0,0,and yeah .,15,0.5,0.11472737044095993
0,0,and then later you might have somebody else who 's using it .,15,0.5,0.12972338497638702
0,0,yeah . right . right . i i see .,15,0.5,0.08393409848213196
0,0,and so you 'd wan na set some,15,0.5,0.1416306346654892
0,0,"i was i was about to say . so if if you ask it `` what what movies are on tv tonight ? `` ,",15,0.5,0.10610897839069366
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.0669945701956749
0,0,"if i look at my wristwatch when i say that it 's about two seconds . the way i currently have the mean subtraction , um , set up , the the analysis window is two seconds .",15,0.5,0.07472724467515945
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1872991919517517
0,0,"so what you just said , about what do you start with , raises a question of what do i start with then ?",15,0.5,0.07199201732873917
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1637164205312729
0,0,i guess it because,15,0.5,0.12589076161384583
0,0,"well , w ok , so in that situation , though , th maybe what 's a little different there , is i think you 're talking about there 's only one it it it also depends we 're getting a little off track here .",15,0.5,0.1552833616733551
0,0,"oh , right .",15,0.5,0.11076419055461884
0,0,"r but but but uh , there 's been some discussion about whether the work we 're doing in that project is gon na be for the kiosk or for the mobile or for both . and i think for this kind of discussion it matters . if it 's in the kiosk , then the physical situation is the same . it 's gon na you know , the exact interaction of the microphone 's gon na differ depending on the person and so forth . but at least the basic acoustics are gon na be the same . so f if it 's really in one kiosk , then i think that you could just chain together and and you know , as much as much speech as possible to because what you 're really trying to get at is the is the reverberation characteristic .",15,0.5,0.10820569097995758
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14730411767959595
0,0,"but in in the case of the mobile , uh , { comment } presumably the acoustic 's changing all over the place .",15,0.5,0.10140081495046616
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08224054425954819
0,0,"and in that case you probably do n't wan na have it be endless because you wan na have some sort of it 's it 's not a question of how long do you think it 's you can get an approximation to a stationary something , given that it 's not really stationary .",15,0.5,0.09270350635051727
0,0,right . right .,15,0.5,0.08377914875745773
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.09379329532384872
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.11598386615514755
0,0,"and i i g i guess i s just started thinking of another question , which is , for for the very first frame , w what what do i do if i 'm if i take if i use that frame to calculate the mean , then i 'm just gon na get n nothing .",15,0.5,0.08453049510717392
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14934901893138885
0,0,"um ,",15,0.5,0.12615807354450226
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.13246197998523712
0,0,so i should probably have some kind of default mean for the first f couple of frames ?,15,0.5,0.1130589172244072
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.08894593268632889
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10055944323539734
0,0,"yeah . or subtract nothing . i mean , it 's",15,0.5,0.12890830636024475
0,0,or subtract nothing . and and that 's that 's i guess that 's something that 's p people have figured out how to deal with in cepstral mean subtraction as well ?,15,0.5,0.10950624942779541
0,0,"yeah , yeah . yeah , people do something . they they , uh , they have some , um , uh , in in cepstral mean subtraction , for short - term window analysis windows , as is usually done , you 're trying to get rid of some very general characteristic . and so , uh , if you have any other information about what a general kind of characteristic would be , then you you can do it there .",15,0.5,0.15721502900123596
0,0,"you can also you can also reflect the data . so you take , uh you know , i 'm not sure how many frames you need .",15,0.5,0.1606549173593521
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08517136424779892
0,0,but you take that many from the front and flip it around to a as the negative value .,15,0.5,0.19707609713077545
0,0,"yeah , that 's yeah .",15,0.5,0.09881751984357834
0,0,so you can always,15,0.5,0.08737744390964508
0,0,"the other thing is that and and i i remember b b n doing this , is that if you have a multi - pass system , um , if the first pass ta it takes most of the computation , the second and the third pass could be very , very quick ,",15,0.5,0.08145792782306671
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.152168869972229
0,0,"just looking at a relatively small n small , uh , space of hypotheses .",15,0.5,0.14462213218212128
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.06346268951892853
0,0,then you can do your first pass without any subtraction at all .,15,0.5,0.15937139093875885
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.11428096890449524
0,0,"and then your second pass , uh , uh , eliminates those most of those hypotheses by , uh by having an improved improved version o of the analysis .",15,0.5,0.05397954210639
0,0,ok . ok .,15,0.5,0.11976133286952972

0,0,"um , so . if we ca n't , we ca n't . but uh we 're gon na try to make this an abbreviated meeting cuz the the next next occupants were pushing for it , so . um . so . agenda is according to this , is transcription status , darpa demos xml tools , disks , backups , et cetera and",15,0.5,0.09328073263168335
0,0,does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ?,15,0.5,0.07942704856395721
0,0,ok . should we just go in order ? transcription status ? who 's that 's probably you .,15,0.5,0.12187935411930084
0,0,"i can do that quickly . um i hired several more transcribers , they 're making great progress .",15,0.5,0.1358686089515686

0,0,i g,15,0.5,0.15732182562351227
0,0,"as a somewhat segue into the next topic , um could i get a hold of uh the data even if it 's not really corrected yet just so i can get the data formats and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ?",15,0.5,0.14437571167945862
0,0,"certainly . yeah i mean , it 's in the same place it 's been .",15,0.5,0.0897165983915329

0,0,"ok , wh",15,0.5,0.09667953848838806
0,0,i also got anot a short remark to the transcription . i 've uh just processed the first five edu meetings and they are chunked up so they would they probably can be sent to ibm whenever they want them .,15,0.5,0.1467408984899521
0,0,cool .,15,0.5,0.10248558223247528

0,0,"ok . it 's april fifth . actually , hynek should be getting back in town shortly if he is n't already .",15,0.5,0.1312745213508606
0,0,is he gon na come here ?,15,0.5,0.085006482899189

0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.08420144021511078
0,0,i have something just fairly brief to report on .,15,0.5,0.09355437755584717
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.12011472880840302
0,0,"um , i did some experim uh , uh , just a few more experiments before i had to , uh , go away for the w well , that week .",15,0.5,0.09049361944198608
0,0,great !,15,0.5,0.1381070911884308
0,0,"was it last week or whenever ? um , so what i was started playing with was the th again , this is the htk back - end . and , um , i was curious because the way that they train up the models , they go through about four sort of rounds of of training . and in the first round they do uh , i think it 's three iterations , and for the last three rounds e e they do seven iterations of re - estimation in each of those three . and so , you know , that 's part of what takes so long to train the the the back - end for this .",15,0.5,0.0968480259180069
0,0,"i 'm sorry , i did n't quite get that . there 's there 's four and there 's seven and i i 'm sorry .",15,0.5,0.08356855809688568
0,0,"yeah . uh , maybe i should write it on the board . so , there 's four rounds of training . um , i g i g i guess you could say iterations . the first one is three , then seven , seven , and seven . and what these numbers refer to is the number of times that the , uh , hmm re - estimation is run . it 's this program called h e",15,0.5,0.09375636279582977
0,0,"but in htk , what 's the difference between , uh , a an inner loop and an outer loop in these iterations ?",15,0.5,0.1042385920882225
0,0,"ok . so what happens is , um , at each one of these points , you increase the number of gaussians in the model .",15,0.5,0.12914690375328064
0,0,"yeah . oh , right ! this was the mix up stuff .",15,0.5,0.10509851574897766
0,0,yeah . the mix up .,15,0.5,0.08247106522321701
0,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.09467939287424088
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10189124196767807
0,0,i remember now .,15,0.5,0.1203867569565773
0,0,"and so , in the final one here , you end up with , uh for all of the the digit words , you end up with , uh , three mixtures per state ,",15,0.5,0.09415008127689362
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10597293078899384
0,0,"eh , in the final thing . so i had done some experiments where i was i i want to play with the number of mixtures .",15,0.5,0.09920831024646759
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.0883619487285614
0,0,"but , um , uh , i wanted to first test to see if we actually need to do this many iterations early on .",15,0.5,0.08221247047185898
0,0,"uh , one , two ,",15,0.5,0.10487204045057297
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12556272745132446
0,0,"and so , um , i i ran a couple of experiments where i reduced that to l to be three , two , two , uh , five , i think , and i got almost the exact same results .",15,0.5,0.08120370656251907
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.21999284625053406
0,0,"and but it runs much much faster . so , um , i i think m it only took something like , uh , three or four hours to do the full training ,",15,0.5,0.1348351538181305
0,0,as opposed to ?,15,0.5,0.10778245329856873
0,0,good .,15,0.5,0.10913339257240295
0,0,"as opposed to wh what , sixteen hours or something like that ? i mean , it takes you have to do an overnight basically , the way it is set up now .",15,0.5,0.1289285272359848
0,0,yeah . it depends .,15,0.5,0.0798991397023201
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.0964340791106224
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1119590774178505
0,0,"so , uh , even we do n't do anything else , doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster .",15,0.5,0.1285952627658844
0,0,"and then when you have your final thing , do a full one , so it 's",15,0.5,0.16219308972358704
0,0,"and when you have your final thing , we go back to this .",15,0.5,0.1266334503889084
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12315668910741806
0,0,"so , um , and it 's a real simple change to make . i mean , it 's like one little text file you edit and change those numbers , and you do n't do anything else .",15,0.5,0.08778388053178787
0,0,"oh , this is a",15,0.5,0.0922091007232666
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10390745103359222
0,0,and then you just run .,15,0.5,0.10624897480010986
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.06880053132772446
0,0,so it 's a very simple change to make and it does n't seem to hurt all that much .,15,0.5,0.07487715780735016
0,0,"so you you run with three , two , two , five ? that 's a",15,0.5,0.1373712718486786
0,0,"so i uh , i i have to look to see what the exact numbers were .",15,0.5,0.09888719767332077
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11880314350128174
0,0,"i i thought was , like , three , two , two , five ,",15,0.5,0.08872789144515991
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13268442451953888
0,0,"but i i 'll i 'll double check . it was over a week ago that i did it ,",15,0.5,0.12264924496412277
0,0,ok . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12370848655700684
0,0,so i ca n't remember exactly .,15,0.5,0.1329738348722458
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.07542881369590759
0,0,"but , uh",15,0.5,0.0471496656537056
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.19174398481845856
0,0,"um , but it 's so much faster . i it makes a big difference .",15,0.5,0.12059507519006729
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.07557247579097748
0,0,so we could do a lot more experiments and throw a lot more stuff in there .,15,0.5,0.09177461266517639
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1273302435874939
0,0,that 's great .,15,0.5,0.12446150928735733
0,0,"um . oh , the other thing that i did was , um , i compiled the htk stuff for the linux boxes . so we have this big thing that we got from ibm , which is a five - processor machine . really fast , but it 's running linux . so , you can now run your experiments on that machine and you can run five at a time and it runs , uh , as fast as , you know , uh , five different machines .",15,0.5,0.0991932675242424
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09165854752063751
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11085527390241623
0,0,"so , um , i 've forgotten now what the name of that machine is but i can i can send email around about it .",15,0.5,0.10293606668710709
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.17240531742572784
0,0,"and so we 've got it now htk 's compiled for both the linux and for , um , the sparcs . um , you have to make you have to make sure that in your dot cshrc , um , it detects whether you 're running on the linux or a a sparc and points to the right executables . uh , and you may not have had that in your dot cshrc before , if you were always just running the sparc . so , um ,",15,0.5,0.13220901787281036
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08309121429920197
0,0,"uh , i can i can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work . but it 'll it really increases what we can run on .",15,0.5,0.0944889485836029
0,0,hmm . cool .,15,0.5,0.11702324450016022
0,0,"so , together with the fact that we 've got these faster linux boxes and that it takes less time to do these , um , we should be able to crank through a lot more experiments .",15,0.5,0.11503957957029343
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10393481701612473
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.09537730365991592
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.11716300994157791
0,0,"so after i did that , then what i wanted to do { comment } was try increasing the number of mixtures , just to see , um see how how that affects performance .",15,0.5,0.11170803010463715
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09493467211723328
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.08474802225828171
0,0,"yeah . in fact , you could do something like keep exactly the same procedure and then add a fifth thing onto it",15,0.5,0.07644888758659363
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11821041256189346
0,0,that had more .,15,0.5,0.11074791848659515
0,0,exactly .,15,0.5,0.08200801908969879
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08861269801855087
0,0,right . right .,15,0.5,0.10050924122333527
0,0,"so at at the middle o where the arrows are showing , that 's you 're adding one more mixture per state ,",15,0.5,0.14326395094394684
0,0,"uh - huh . uh ,",15,0.5,0.08613818883895874
0,0,or ?,15,0.5,0.24935999512672424
0,0,"let 's see , uh . it goes from this uh , try to go it backwards this at this point it 's two mixtures per state . so this just adds one . except that , uh , actually for the silence model , it 's six mixtures per state .",15,0.5,0.10191651433706284
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.090065598487854
0,0,"uh , so it goes to two .",15,0.5,0.08010343462228775
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.11940167844295502
0,0,um . and i think what happens here is,15,0.5,0.07436073571443558
0,0,"might be between , uh , shared , uh shared variances or something ,",15,0.5,0.06381752341985703
0,0,yeah . i think that 's what it is .,15,0.5,0.13054966926574707
0,0,or,15,0.5,0.07730524241924286
0,0,"uh , yeah . it 's , uh shoot . i i i ca n't remember now what happens at that first one . uh , i have to look it up and see .",15,0.5,0.0752013623714447
0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.12196581810712814
0,0,"um , there because they start off with , uh , an initial model which is just this global model , and then they split it to the individuals . and so , it may be that that 's what 's happening here . i i i have to look it up and see . i i do n't exactly remember .",15,0.5,0.11183973401784897
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07725109159946442

0,0,so . that 's it .,15,0.5,0.09761422872543335
0,0,alright . so what else ?,15,0.5,0.07171445339918137
0,0,"um . yeah . there was a conference call this tuesday . um . i do n't know yet the what happened tuesday , but the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , uh , things like the weights , uh",15,0.5,0.09516731649637222
0,0,"oh , this is a conference call for , uh , uh , aurora participant sort of thing .",15,0.5,0.1751711517572403
0,0,for,15,0.5,0.07578074932098389
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.10362237691879272
0,0,i see .,15,0.5,0.11620419472455978
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.08779110759496689
0,0,"do you know who was who was since we were n't in on it , uh , do you know who was in from ogi ? was was was hynek involved or was it sunil",15,0.5,0.06517497450113297
0,0,i have no idea .,15,0.5,0.09890784323215485
0,0,or ?,15,0.5,0.1346595734357834
0,0,"mmm , i just",15,0.5,0.1130814254283905
0,0,"oh , you do n't know . ok .",15,0.5,0.09544406831264496
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1153748482465744
0,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.11048351228237152
0,0,"um , yeah . so the points were the the weights how to weight the different error rates that are obtained from different language and and conditions . um , it 's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting . right now it 's a weighting on on improvement .",15,0.5,0.13722899556159973
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.0977281853556633
0,0,"some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on uh well , to to combine error rates before computing improvement . uh , and the fact is that for right now for the english , they have weights they they combine error rates , but for the other languages they combine improvement . so it 's not very consistent . um",15,0.5,0.0928574651479721
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10838095843791962
0,0,"yeah . the , um yeah . and so well , this is a point . and right now actually there is a thing also , uh , that happens with the current weight is that a very non - significant improvement on the well - matched case result in huge differences in in the final number .",15,0.5,0.09452085942029953
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10344668477773666
0,0,"and so , perhaps they will change the weights to",15,0.5,0.08920260518789291
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.0903286412358284
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1166105568408966
0,0,"how should that be done ? i mean , it it seems like there 's a simple way",15,0.5,0.10511333495378494
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09958942979574203
0,0,"uh , this seems like an obvious mistake or something .",15,0.5,0.09932605177164078
0,0,"well , i mean , the fact that it 's inconsistent is an obvious mistake .",15,0.5,0.14664283394813538
0,0,th - they 're,15,0.5,0.11515620350837708
0,0,"but the but , um , the other thing",15,0.5,0.16440311074256897
0,0,in,15,0.5,0.13371625542640686
0,0,"i do n't know i have n't thought it through , but one one would think that each it it 's like if you say what 's the what 's the best way to do an average , an arithmetic average or a geometric average ?",15,0.5,0.12550033628940582
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09337745606899261
0,0,it depends what you wan na show .,15,0.5,0.09383313357830048
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13247732818126678
0,0,each each one is gon na have a different characteristic .,15,0.5,0.12466710805892944
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11935443431138992
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.11090012639760971
0,0,"well , it seems like they should do , like , the percentage improvement or something , rather than the absolute improvement .",15,0.5,0.11207105219364166
0,0,tha - that 's what they do .,15,0.5,0.08040699362754822

0,0,"no , that is relative . but the question is , do you average the relative improvements or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ?",15,0.5,0.10337268561124802
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.09666436165571213
0,0,and the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings .,15,0.5,0.1656322330236435
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.10915759205818176
0,0,it 's a weighted average . um .,15,0.5,0.08464549481868744
0,0,"yeah . and so when you average the the relative improvement it tends to to give a lot of of , um , importance to the well - matched case because the baseline is already very good and , um , i it 's",15,0.5,0.08217359334230423
0,0,"why do n't they not look at improvements but just look at your av your scores ? you know , figure out how to combine the scores",15,0.5,0.09627582132816315
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11101401597261429
0,0,"with a weight or whatever , and then give you a score here 's your score . and then they can do the same thing for the baseline system and here 's its score . and then you can look at",15,0.5,0.09969541430473328
0,1,"and and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things . uh , i mean , one could argue about the lda and so forth but i i think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things . but what what",15,0.5,0.07516022771596909
0,0,"so how did they fill up this all these these bits ? i mean , if we 're u",15,0.5,0.1817084401845932
0,0,"um , why are we using half ? well , so you could you c",15,0.5,0.11678455024957657
0,0,"yeah . or how are they using more than half , i guess maybe is what i",15,0.5,0.09142956137657166
0,0,"yeah , so i i think uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if i 'm wrong , but i i think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects . uh , they have some cepstral modification ,",15,0.5,0.06901857256889343
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14042966067790985
0,0,"right ? in our case we have a couple things . we have the on - line normalization and then we have the lda rasta . and they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us . but in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing . but there 's one difference . the lda rasta , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies . and they 're not doing that .",15,0.5,0.07506779581308365
0,0,so th so,15,0.5,0.1145382821559906
0,0,"so that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample .",15,0.5,0.08956638723611832
0,0,get down .,15,0.5,0.11654668301343918
0,0,i see . i see .,15,0.5,0.09561748802661896
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.09553956240415573
0,0,so what if you did n't so do you explicitly downsample then ? do we explicitly downsample ?,15,0.5,0.08195994794368744
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.0878114253282547
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11754896491765976
0,0,and what if we did n't do that ? would we get worse performance ?,15,0.5,0.1247548833489418
0,0,"um yeah , not better , not worse .",15,0.5,0.11334063857793808
0,0,"i think it does n't affect it , does it ?",15,0.5,0.09591004997491837
0,0,i see . ok .,15,0.5,0.12174008041620255
0,0,"yeah . so i think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information .",15,0.5,0.10509328544139862
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.0937199518084526
0,0,"and , uh , so i you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream uh , helps a lot . so that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though i 'm saying i think we could do much better , just because it 's simple .",15,0.5,0.08924726396799088
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12517258524894714
0,0,"um . and you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , `` oh , yeah , i understand `` , is is very helpful .",15,0.5,0.11432244628667831
0,0,"so you would you 're you 're thinking to put the , uh , mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff ? or after ?",15,0.5,0.14386673271656036
0,0,"well , that 's a question . i mean , we were talking about that . it looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , uh , remove the noise , um , and , uh ,",15,0.5,0.1650780439376831
0,0,"cuz that happens before the mel conversion , right ?",15,0.5,0.22354605793952942
0,0,"yeah . so , i mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion . there 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not . uh . i sort of think you should , but i do n't know .",15,0.5,0.09270111471414566
0,0,what about norm normalizing also ?,15,0.5,0.10470858961343765
0,0,"right . uh . well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ?",15,0.5,0.077427439391613
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1745063215494156
0,0,"yeah , probably . some kind would be good . you know ? i would think .",15,0.5,0.12880045175552368
0,0,"well , it it it it so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the uh , the frame .",15,0.5,0.11546937376260757
0,0,if you do or do n't normalize ?,15,0.5,0.08932884782552719
0,0,if yo if you do n't normalize and if if you do n't normalize .,15,0.5,0.08846583962440491
0,0,"right . yes , so i mean , one would think that you would want to normalize . but i i w w my thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it . and then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , `` ok , this much effect `` i mean , you do n't want to change six things and then see what happens . you want to change them one at a time .",15,0.5,0.08146850764751434
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09226936846971512
0,0,"so adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way . and then saying , oh uh particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization . normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot . so , i would think you would wan na have some baseline that says , `` ok , we do n't normalize , this is what we get `` , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization . but but the other question is so i think ultimately we 'll wind up doing some normalization . i agree .",15,0.5,0.05695391446352005

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14350652694702148
0,0,so it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on . it 's depending on the same data as the other .,15,0.5,0.16636215150356293
0,0,same data .,15,0.5,0.09584128856658936

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12474900484085083
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.0728745087981224
0,0,"so with this , uh , new stream would you train up a vad on both both features , somehow ?",15,0.5,0.13257081806659698
0,0,"no , i guess the vad has its own set of features .",15,0.5,0.12320687621831894
0,0,ok . that 's,15,0.5,0.11007288843393326
0,0,"i mean , which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams .",15,0.5,0.05628358572721481
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15330536663532257
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08382254838943481
0,0,"and there is also the idea of using traps , maybe , for the vad , which , um",15,0.5,0.07446905225515366
0,0,"yeah , that 's also",15,0.5,0.13003745675086975
0,0,"well , pratibha apparently showed , when , she was at ibm , that it 's a good idea . so .",15,0.5,0.10494168847799301

0,0,it would have to fit but yeah .,15,0.5,0.1743483990430832
0,0,"yeah , if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff .",15,0.5,0.17215588688850403
0,0,"well , there 's the delays and the storage ,",15,0.5,0.1511749029159546
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08848872035741806

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.07099130004644394
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.125643789768219
0,0,i think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net . right ?,15,0.5,0.09472455829381943
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08694607764482498
0,0,"yeah . um . and so i guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based traps , and and how big are they ? so that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue .",15,0.5,0.1169930025935173
0,0,"oh , right .",15,0.5,0.0660095065832138
0,0,maybe they can be little ones .,15,0.5,0.06904196739196777

0,0,mini - traps .,15,0.5,0.14128784835338593

0,0,right . and maybe for vad they would be ok . yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.073917455971241
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.16743092238903046

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1223769336938858
0,0,"or a simple neural net , right ? i mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple uh , uh uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data .",15,0.5,0.08949218690395355
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13011038303375244

0,0,mm - hmm . right .,15,0.5,0.10264936834573746

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.11123804748058319
0,0,"yeah . and like i was saying , i think the you know , the basic directions are , uh , uh i mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , uh , the second stream . and then , uh , improving the vad . uh . so .",15,0.5,0.09971275925636292
0,0,"so , i 'll , um i 'll actually after the meeting i 'll add the second stream to the vad and maybe i 'll start with the feature net in that case . it 's like , you 're looking at the vad , right ?",15,0.5,0.10309988260269165

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12378627806901932
0,0,"and compared to , um , do using a twelve second centered window , i think there was a drop in performance but it was just a slight drop .",15,0.5,0.10642079263925552
0,0,hmm !,15,0.5,0.09838803857564926
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.099830761551857
0,0,is is that right ?,15,0.5,0.08827609568834305
0,0,"um , yeah , i mean , it was pretty it was pretty tiny . yeah .",15,0.5,0.10686992108821869
0,0,"uh - huh . so that was encouraging . and , um , that that um , that 's encouraging for for the idea of using it in an interactive system like and , um , another issue i 'm i 'm thinking about is in the smartkom system . so say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ? and , um so i w bef before , um back in may , i did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . in those i trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . and , um , here , i was curious , what if i trained the models using twelve seconds but i f i gave it a situation where the test set i was subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . and , um so i did that for about three different conditions . and , um i mean , i th i think it was , um , four se i think i think it was , um , something like four seconds and , um , six seconds , and eight seconds . something like that . and it seems like it it it hurts compared to if you actually train the models { comment } using th that same length of time but it it does n't hurt that much . um , u usually less than point five percent , although i think i did see one where it was a point eight percent or so rise in word error rate . but this is , um , w where , um , even if i train on the , uh , model , and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test , it the word error rate is around , um , ten percent or nine percent . so it does n't seem like that big a d a difference .",15,0.5,0.11661241203546524
0,0,"but it but looking at it the other way , is n't it what you 're saying that it did n't help you to have the longer time for training , if you were going to have a short time for",15,0.5,0.14839743077754974
0,0,"that that 's true . um ,",15,0.5,0.15983980894088745

0,0,wa,15,0.5,0.04858725890517235

0,0,"is this twelve seconds of uh , regardless of speech or silence ? or twelve seconds of speech ?",15,0.5,0.0715557336807251

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09340793639421463
0,0,"the other thing , um , which maybe relates a little bit to something else we 've talked about in terms of windowing and so on is , that , um , i wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in you used two seconds , and when you were four seconds in , you used four seconds , and when you were six and you basically build up to the twelve seconds . so that if you have very long utterances you have the best ,",15,0.5,0.08190377801656723
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.17337632179260254
0,0,but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can .,15,0.5,0.1295885145664215
0,0,right . and that 's actually what we 're planning to do in,15,0.5,0.07213016599416733
0,0,ok . yeah .,15,0.5,0.11537223309278488
0,0,"but s so i g so i guess the que the question i was trying to get at with those experiments is , `` does it matter what models you use ? does it matter how much time y you use to calculate the mean when you were , um , tra doing the training data ? ``",15,0.5,0.09638269990682602
0,0,"right . but i mean the other thing is that that 's i mean , the other way of looking at this , going back to , uh , mean cepstral subtraction versus rasta kind of things , is that you could look at mean cepstral subtraction , especially the way you 're doing it , uh , as being a kind of filter . and so , the other thing is just to design a filter . you know , basically you 're you 're you 're doing a high - pass filter or a band - pass filter of some sort and and just design a filter . and then , you know , a filter will have a certain behavior and you loo can look at the start up behavior when you start up with nothing .",15,0.5,0.06948348134756088
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12538279592990875
0,0,"and and , you know , it will , uh , if you have an iir filter for instance , it will , um , uh , not behave in the steady - state way that you would like it to behave until you get a long enough period , but , um , uh , by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only a subtraction of the mean , you 're kind of , you know , tying your hands behind your back because there 's filters have all sorts of be temporal and spectral behaviors .",15,0.5,0.09924869984388351
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12186886370182037
0,0,"and the only thing , you know , consistent that we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency component .",15,0.5,0.11300491541624069
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.09772181510925293
0,0,"but do you really want to calculate the mean ? and you neglect all the silence regions { comment } or you just use everything that 's twelve seconds , and",15,0.5,0.11963072419166565
0,0,"um , you do you mean in my tests so far ?",15,0.5,0.0934620276093483
0,0,ye - yeah .,15,0.5,0.12847800552845
0,0,most of the silence has been cut out .,15,0.5,0.09541373699903488
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1788628101348877
0,0,just there 's just inter - word silences .,15,0.5,0.07187490165233612
0,0,"mm - hmm . and they are , like , pretty short . shor",15,0.5,0.12786467373371124
0,0,pretty short .,15,0.5,0.10694397240877151

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08157947659492493
0,0,yeah . mm - hmm . so you really need a lot of speech to estimate the mean of it .,15,0.5,0.07826410979032516
0,0,"well , if i only use six seconds , it still works pretty well .",15,0.5,0.08449705690145493
0,0,yeah . yeah . uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.12068180739879608
0,0,i saw in my test before . i was trying twelve seconds cuz that was the best in my test before,15,0.5,0.11503477394580841
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09134025871753693
0,0,and that increasing past twelve seconds did n't seem to help .,15,0.5,0.06411582231521606
0,0,hmm . huh .,15,0.5,0.10953698307275772
0,0,"th um , yeah , i guess it 's something i need to play with more to decide how to set that up for the smartkom system . like , may maybe if i trained on six seconds it would work better when i only had two seconds or four seconds , and",15,0.5,0.10988325625658035
0,0,"yeah . yeah . and , um",15,0.5,0.16160927712917328
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09279592335224152
0,0,"yeah , and again , if you take this filtering perspective and if you essentially have it build up over time . i mean , if you computed means over two and then over four , and over six , essentially what you 're getting at is a kind of , uh , ramp up of a filter anyway . and so you may may just want to think of it as a filter . but , uh , if you do that , then , um , in practice somebody using the smartkom system , one would think { comment } if they 're using it for a while , it means that their first utterance , instead of , you know , getting , uh , a forty percent error rate reduction , they 'll get a uh , over what , uh , you 'd get without this , uh , um , policy , uh , you get thirty percent . and then the second utterance that you give , they get the full you know , uh , full benefit of it if it 's this ongoing thing .",15,0.5,0.0854816809296608
0,0,"oh , so you you cache the utterances ? that 's how you get your , uh",15,0.5,0.09912160038948059

0,0,"oh , i yeah , so what happened here is that , um , the overall improvement that they have with this method so well , to be more precise , what they have is , they have these alignments and then they drop the beginning silence and and the end silence but they keep , uh , two hundred milliseconds before speech and two hundred after speech . and they keep the speech pauses also . um , and the overall improvement over the mfcc baseline so , when they just , uh , add this frame dropping in addition it 's r uh , forty percent , right ?",15,0.5,0.07566289603710175

0,0,"ok , so the wiener filter , it 's it 's like it 's like you try to minimize i mean , so the basic principle of wiener filter is like you try to minimize the , uh , d uh , difference between the noisy signal and the clean signal if you have two channels . like let 's say you have a clean t signal and you have an additional channel where you know what is the noisy signal .",15,0.5,0.05343149974942207

0,0,"mm - hmm , ok .",15,0.5,0.14786507189273834

0,0,it 's not quite better .,15,0.5,0.10292337089776993

0,0,this is the work that i did during this date,15,0.5,0.12241768091917038
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.11933732032775879
0,0,and also mmm i h hynek last week say that if i have time i can to begin to to study well seriously the france telecom proposal,15,0.5,0.17377221584320068
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.0706275999546051
0,0,to look at the code and something like that to know exactly what they are doing because maybe that we can have some ideas,15,0.5,0.07275769114494324
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1353914886713028
0,0,but not only to read the proposal . look insi look i carefully what they are doing with the program @ @ and i begin to to work also in that . but the first thing that i do n't understand is that they are using r - the uh log energy that this quite i do n't know why they have some constant in the expression of the lower energy . i do n't know what that means .,15,0.5,0.12978295981884003
0,0,"they have a constant in there , you said ?",15,0.5,0.06446655839681625
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12705662846565247
0,0,"oh , at the front it says uh `` log energy is equal to the rounded version of sixteen over the log of two ``",15,0.5,0.1348089575767517
0,0,this yeah .,15,0.5,0.05915602296590805
0,0,uh . uh times the,15,0.5,0.07876937091350555
0,0,then maybe i can understand .,15,0.5,0.13816671073436737
0,0,"well , this is natural log , and maybe it has something to do with the fact that this is i i have no idea .",15,0.5,0.17341728508472443
0,0,"is that some kind of base conversion , or ?",15,0.5,0.11145678162574768
0,0,"yeah , that 's what i was thinking , but but um , then there 's the sixty - four , uh , i do n't know .",15,0.5,0.06391508132219315
0,0,because maybe they 're the threshold that they are using on the basis of this value,15,0.5,0.17230334877967834
0,0,experimental results .,15,0.5,0.11348456144332886

0,0,"i do n't know exactly , because well th i thought maybe they have a meaning . but i do n't know what is the meaning of take exactly this value .",15,0.5,0.08904104679822922
0,0,"yeah , it 's pretty funny looking .",15,0.5,0.1238296702504158
0,0,so they 're taking the number inside the log and raising it to sixteen over log base two .,15,0.5,0.1589507758617401
0,0,"i do n't know . yeah , i um right . sixteen over { comment } two .",15,0.5,0.10070878267288208
0,0,"does it have to do with those sixty - fours , or ?",15,0.5,0.10028687864542007
0,0,"um . if we ignore the sixteen , the natural log of t one over the natural log of two times the natu i do n't know . well , maybe somebody 'll think of something ,",15,0.5,0.18294838070869446
0,0,"but this is uh it may just be that they they want to have for very small energies , they want to have some kind of a",15,0.5,0.09642381221055984
0,0,"yeah , the e the effect i do n't @ @ i can understand the effect of this , no ? because it 's to to do something like that .",15,0.5,0.07100658863782883
0,0,"well , it says , since you 're taking a natural log , it says that when when you get down to essentially zero energy , this is gon na be the natural log of one , which is zero .",15,0.5,0.19961947202682495
0,0,no ? mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10790828615427017
0,0,"so it 'll go down to uh to the natural log being so the lowest value for this would be zero . so y you 're restricted to being positive . and this sort of smooths it for very small energies . uh , why they chose sixty - four and something else , that was probably just experimental . and the the the constant in front of it , i have no idea .",15,0.5,0.13496670126914978
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10220449417829514
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.13940143585205078
0,0,"well . i i will look to try if i move this parameter in their code what happens , maybe everything is maybe they tres hole are on basis of this .",15,0.5,0.10944296419620514
0,0,"uh i mean it they they probably have some fi particular s fixed point arithmetic that they 're using ,",15,0.5,0.09781245142221451
0,0,i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.17127801477909088
0,0,and then it just,15,0.5,0.07683230191469193
0,0,"yeah , i was just gon na say maybe it has something to do with hardware ,",15,0.5,0.07717371731996536
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10346093028783798
0,0,something they were doing .,15,0.5,0.12060227990150452
0,0,"yeah , i mean that they 're s probably working with fixed point or integer or something . i think you 're supposed to on this stuff anyway , and and so maybe that puts it in the right realm somewhere .",15,0.5,0.12282925099134445
0,0,"well it just , yeah , puts it in the right range , or",15,0.5,0.08325088769197464
0,0,"yeah . i think , given at the level you 're doing things in floating point on the computer , i do n't think it matters , would be my guess ,",15,0.5,0.085023432970047
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09472363442182541
0,0,but .,15,0.5,0.13279424607753754
0,0,i this more or less anything,15,0.5,0.08349897712469101
0,0,"yeah . ok , and wh when did stephane take off ? he took off",15,0.5,0.08200052380561829
0,0,i think that stephane will arrive today or tomorrow .,15,0.5,0.16936762630939484
0,0,"oh , he was gone these first few days , and then he 's here for a couple days before he goes to salt lake city .",15,0.5,0.0870596170425415

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.0905979797244072
0,0,he 's i think that he is in las vegas or something like that .,15,0.5,0.10747795552015305
0,0,yeah . yeah . so he 's he 's going to icassp which is good . i i do n't know if there are many people who are going to icassp,15,0.5,0.14190290868282318
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10943768918514252

0,0,"um , people are less consistent about going to icassp and i think it 's still it 's still a reasonable forum for students to to present things . uh , it 's i think for engineering students of any kind , i think it 's it 's if you have n't been there much , it 's good to go to , uh to get a feel for things , a range of things , not just speech . uh . but i think for for sort of dyed - in - the - wool speech people , um i think that icslp and eurospeech are much more targeted .",15,0.5,0.08332584798336029

0,0,"so i 'm i i just need to ask um malek . one more . um . tsk . then uh i talked a little bit about um continuing with these dynamic ev um acoustic events , and um we 're we 're we 're thinking about a way to test the completeness of a a set of um dynamic uh events . uh , completeness in the in the sense that um if we if we pick these x number of acoustic events , do they provide sufficient coverage for the phones that we 're trying to recognize or or the f the words that we 're gon na try to recognize later on . and so morgan and i were uh discussing um s uh s a form of a cheating experiment where we get um we have uh um a chosen set of features , or acoustic events , and we train up a hybrid um system to do phone recognition on timit . so i i the idea is if we get good phone recognition results , using um these set of acoustic events , then um that that says that these acoustic events are g sufficient to cover a set of phones , at least found in timit . um so i it would be a a measure of `` are we on the right track with with the the choices of our acoustic events `` . um , so that 's going on . and also , just uh working on my uh final project for jordan 's class , uh which is",15,0.5,0.08859601616859436

0,0,"ok , sure .",15,0.5,0.1447519212961197
0,0,"let me back up while we 're still on it . the the other thing i was suggesting , though , is that given that you 're talking about binary features , uh , maybe the first thing to do is just to count and uh count co - occurrences and get probabilities for a discrete hmm cuz that 'd be pretty simple because it 's just say , if you had ten ten events , uh that you were counting , uh each frame would only have a thousand possible values for these ten bits , and uh so you could make a table that would say , if you had thirty - nine phone categories , that would be a thousand by thirty - nine , and just count the co - occurrences and divide them by the the uh uh uh occ uh count the co - occurrences between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrences of the phone , and that would give you the likelihood of the of the event given the phone . and um then just use that in a very simple hmm and uh you could uh do phone recognition then and uh would n't have any of the issues of the uh training of the net or i mean , it 'd be on the simple side , but",15,0.5,0.10006260871887207
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.16727714240550995
0,0,"uh um you know , if uh uh the example i was giving was that if if you had um onset of voicing and and end of voicing as being two kinds of events , then if you had those a all marked correctly , and you counted co - occurrences , you should get it completely right .",15,0.5,0.10567032545804977
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12980450689792633
0,0,"so . um but you 'd get all the other distinctions , you know , randomly wrong . i mean there 'd be nothing to tell you that . so um uh if you just do this by counting , then you should be able to find out in a pretty straightforward way whether you have a sufficient uh set of events to to do the kind of level of of uh classification of phones that you 'd like . so that was that was the idea . and then the other thing that we were discussing was was um ok , how do you get the your training data .",15,0.5,0.0945131927728653
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.15338477492332458
0,0,"cuz uh the switchboard transcription project uh uh you know was half a dozen people , or so working off and on over a couple years , and uh similar similar amount of data to what you 're talking about with timit training . so , it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is uh to automatically translate the uh current timit markings into the markings you want . and uh it wo n't have the kind of characteristic that you 'd like , of catching funny kind of things that maybe are n't there from these automatic markings ,",15,0.5,0.10716281086206436

0,0,"no , but those are all different people with different i mean , i in y so for instance , in in the in a telephone task , these are different phone calls . so you do n't wan na @ @ { comment } chain it together from a from a different phone call .",15,0.5,0.11455103754997253
0,0,"ok , so so so they would g s",15,0.5,0.09665895998477936
0,0,"so it 's within speaker , within phone call ,",15,0.5,0.10758653283119202
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1973465532064438

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.10746791958808899
0,0,r and it,15,0.5,0.09407183527946472
0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.07076174020767212
0,0,"right . ok , so you 'd you and so in training you would start over at at every new phone call or at every new speaker . yeah ,",15,0.5,0.08974272757768631
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13151699304580688
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10762830823659897
0,0,"yeah . now , you know , maybe you 'd use something from the others just because at the beginning of a call you do n't know anything , and so you might have some kind of general thing that 's your best guess to start with . but so , s i i you know , a lot of these things are proprietary so we 're doing a little bit of guesswork here . i mean , what do comp what do people do who really face these problems in the field ? well , they have companies and they do n't tell other people exactly what they do .",15,0.5,0.12232574075460434
0,0,r right .,15,0.5,0.13741281628608704
0,0,"but but i mean , when you the the hints that you get from what they when they talk about it are that they do they all do something like this .",15,0.5,0.14283344149589539
0,0,"right , ok . i see . bec - because i so this smartkom task first off , it 's this tv and movie information system .",15,0.5,0.09943678230047226
0,0,"yeah , but you might have somebody who 's using it",15,0.5,0.07612495869398117
0,0,and yeah .,15,0.5,0.11472737044095993
0,0,and then later you might have somebody else who 's using it .,15,0.5,0.12972338497638702
0,0,yeah . right . right . i i see .,15,0.5,0.08393409848213196
0,0,and so you 'd wan na set some,15,0.5,0.1416306346654892
0,0,"i was i was about to say . so if if you ask it `` what what movies are on tv tonight ? `` ,",15,0.5,0.10610897839069366
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.06699575483798981
0,0,"if i look at my wristwatch when i say that it 's about two seconds . the way i currently have the mean subtraction , um , set up , the the analysis window is two seconds .",15,0.5,0.07472852617502213

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1637163907289505
0,0,i guess it because,15,0.5,0.12589076161384583
0,0,"well , w ok , so in that situation , though , th maybe what 's a little different there , is i think you 're talking about there 's only one it it it also depends we 're getting a little off track here .",15,0.5,0.1552833616733551
0,0,"oh , right .",15,0.5,0.11076414585113525
0,0,"r but but but uh , there 's been some discussion about whether the work we 're doing in that project is gon na be for the kiosk or for the mobile or for both . and i think for this kind of discussion it matters . if it 's in the kiosk , then the physical situation is the same . it 's gon na you know , the exact interaction of the microphone 's gon na differ depending on the person and so forth . but at least the basic acoustics are gon na be the same . so f if it 's really in one kiosk , then i think that you could just chain together and and you know , as much as much speech as possible to because what you 're really trying to get at is the is the reverberation characteristic .",15,0.5,0.108205646276474
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14730411767959595
0,0,"but in in the case of the mobile , uh , { comment } presumably the acoustic 's changing all over the place .",15,0.5,0.1014007106423378
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.0822405070066452
0,0,"and in that case you probably do n't wan na have it be endless because you wan na have some sort of it 's it 's not a question of how long do you think it 's you can get an approximation to a stationary something , given that it 's not really stationary .",15,0.5,0.09270387887954712
0,0,right . right .,15,0.5,0.08377673476934433
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.09379329532384872
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.11598829180002213
0,0,"and i i g i guess i s just started thinking of another question , which is , for for the very first frame , w what what do i do if i 'm if i take if i use that frame to calculate the mean , then i 'm just gon na get n nothing .",15,0.5,0.08453582972288132

0,0,"um ,",15,0.5,0.12615807354450226
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.1324620395898819
0,0,so i should probably have some kind of default mean for the first f couple of frames ?,15,0.5,0.11305896937847137
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.0889458954334259
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10055944323539734
0,0,"yeah . or subtract nothing . i mean , it 's",15,0.5,0.12893033027648926
0,0,or subtract nothing . and and that 's that 's i guess that 's something that 's p people have figured out how to deal with in cepstral mean subtraction as well ?,15,0.5,0.10953499376773834
0,0,"yeah , yeah . yeah , people do something . they they , uh , they have some , um , uh , in in cepstral mean subtraction , for short - term window analysis windows , as is usually done , you 're trying to get rid of some very general characteristic . and so , uh , if you have any other information about what a general kind of characteristic would be , then you you can do it there .",15,0.5,0.15719391405582428
0,0,"you can also you can also reflect the data . so you take , uh you know , i 'm not sure how many frames you need .",15,0.5,0.16066068410873413
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08516097813844681
0,0,but you take that many from the front and flip it around to a as the negative value .,15,0.5,0.19706878066062927
0,0,"yeah , that 's yeah .",15,0.5,0.09883188456296921
0,0,so you can always,15,0.5,0.08737733215093613
0,0,"the other thing is that and and i i remember b b n doing this , is that if you have a multi - pass system , um , if the first pass ta it takes most of the computation , the second and the third pass could be very , very quick ,",15,0.5,0.0814577117562294
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.15216916799545288
0,0,"just looking at a relatively small n small , uh , space of hypotheses .",15,0.5,0.144622340798378
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.06346273422241211
0,0,then you can do your first pass without any subtraction at all .,15,0.5,0.159371480345726
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.11428096890449524
0,0,"and then your second pass , uh , uh , eliminates those most of those hypotheses by , uh by having an improved improved version o of the analysis .",15,0.5,0.05397954210639
0,0,ok . ok .,15,0.5,0.11976133286952972
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.09772118926048279
0,0,"ok . so that was all i had , for now .",15,0.5,0.10467709600925446
0,1,"oh , the short amount of time thing , right .",15,0.5,0.10124491900205612
0,0,"so so we you know , we had spent a lot of time , um , writing up the hlt paper and we wanted to use that , uh , kind of analysis ,",15,0.5,0.0889483317732811
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.16338783502578735
0,0,"but the hlt paper has , you know , it 's a very crude measure of overlap . it 's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap , it 's just whether or not the , um , the segments that were all synchronized , whether there was some overlap somewhere .",15,0.5,0.15143869817256927
0,0,c high correlation .,15,0.5,0.13857616484165192
0,0,"and , you know , that pointed out some differences , so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because dan said the cross - cancellation , it 's not straight - forward . if it were straight - forward then we would try it , but so , it 's sort of good to hear that it was not straight - forward , thinking if we can get decent forced alignments , then at least we can do sort of a overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time , but , um",15,0.5,0.15062132477760315
0,0,i did n't think that his message said it was n't straight - forward .,15,0.5,0.06789758801460266
0,0,well if we 'd just,15,0.5,0.11616959422826767
0,0,well,15,0.5,0.12262842059135437
0,0,i thought he 's just saying you have to look over a longer time window when you do it .,15,0.5,0.10265300422906876
0,0,um - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09453873336315155
0,0,"and the but there are some issues of this timing , um , in the recordings",15,0.5,0.11423508822917938
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08249961584806442
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.09776167571544647
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.13920198380947113
0,0,"so you just have to look over longer time when you 're trying to align the things , you ca n't you ca n't just look",15,0.5,0.1444046050310135
0,0,well . are you talking about the fact that the recording software does n't do time - synchronous ? is that what you 're referring to ?,15,0.5,0.13130807876586914
0,0,that seems to me you can do that over the entire file and get a very accurate,15,0.5,0.12271655350923538
0,0,i do n't thi i d i do n't think that was the issue .,15,0.5,0.09912194311618805
0,0,"i yeah , that was sort of a side issue .",15,0.5,0.08907968550920486
0,0,i did n't think so either .,15,0.5,0.07561676949262619
0,0,the issue was that you have to you have have you first have to have a pretty good speech detection on the individual channels .,15,0.5,0.11081620305776596
0,0,"and it 's dynamic , so i guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able t to so so there are some things available , and i do n't know too much about this area where if people are n't moving around much than you could apply them , and it should work pretty well if you took care of this recording time difference .",15,0.5,0.1616947203874588
0,0,"right , which should be pretty straight forward .",15,0.5,0.0808078795671463
0,0,"which a at least is well defined , and",15,0.5,0.09465605020523071
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1313713937997818
0,0,"um , but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances , then it was n't i guess it just was n't something that he could do quickly and not in time for us to be able to do something by two weeks from now , so . well less than a week . so um , so i do n't know what we can do if anything , that 's sort of worth , you know , a eurospeech paper at this point .",15,0.5,0.1446155607700348
0,0,"well , andreas , how well did it work on the non - lapel stuff ?",15,0.5,0.10071493685245514
0,0,yeah . that 's what i was gon na say .,15,0.5,0.11780250817537308
0,0,i have n't checked those yet .,15,0.5,0.10576759278774261
0,0,c,15,0.5,0.09026696532964706
0,0,it 's very tedious to check these .,15,0.5,0.10321470350027084
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.14687828719615936
0,0,"um , we would really need , ideally , a transcriber to time mark the you know , the be at least the beginning and s ends { comment } of contiguous speech . um , and , you know , then with the time marks , you can do an automatic comparison of your of your forced alignments .",15,0.5,0.14399376511573792
0,0,"because really the the at least in terms of how we were gon na use this in our system was to get an ideal an idea , uh , for each channel about the start and end boundaries .",15,0.5,0.06869271397590637
0,0,"oh , mncm .",15,0.5,0.08451184630393982
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1386512815952301
0,0,"we do n't really care about like intermediate word boundaries , so",15,0.5,0.15005765855312347
0,0,"no , that 's how i 've been looking at it .",15,0.5,0.07208948582410812
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08878324925899506
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11888719350099564
0,0,"i mean , i do n't care that the individual words are aligned correctly ,",15,0.5,0.08880214393138885
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15140992403030396
0,0,"but you do n't wan na , uh , infer from the alignment that someone spoke who did n't .",15,0.5,0.10936049371957779
0,0,"right , exactly . so that 's why i was wondering if it",15,0.5,0.09850221872329712
0,0,"so , so",15,0.5,0.1216232180595398
0,0,"i mean , maybe if it does n't work for lapel stuff , we can just not use that",15,0.5,0.10739022493362427
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12013169378042221
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.08909124881029129
0,0,"i have n't i ha just have n't had the time to , um , do the same procedure on one of the so i would need a k i would need a channel that has a speaker whose who has a lot of overlap but s you know , is a non - lapel mike . and , um , where preferably , also there 's someone sitting next to them who talks a lot .",15,0.5,0.08756928890943527
0,0,hmm !,15,0.5,0.12695756554603577
0,0,"so , i",15,0.5,0.12702229619026184
0,0,so a meeting with me in it .,15,0.5,0.1355120837688446
0,0,maybe someone can help me find a good candidate and then i would be willing to,15,0.5,0.083391472697258
0,0,we c you know what ? maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these .,15,0.5,0.22373038530349731
0,0,"you know , hand",15,0.5,0.1638665348291397
0,0,"cuz you can see the seat numbers , and then you can see what type of mike they were using . and so we just look for , you know , somebody sitting next to adam at one of the meetings",15,0.5,0.15149687230587006
0,0,"actually y we can tell from the data that we have ,",15,0.5,0.13174432516098022
0,0,"from the insertions , maybe ?",15,0.5,0.07373339682817459
0,0,"um , yeah , there 's a way to tell .",15,0.5,0.08634644001722336
0,0,fr fr from the,15,0.5,0.13513968884944916
0,0,"it might not be a single person who 's always overlapping that person but any number of people ,",15,0.5,0.11099538207054138
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08670173585414886
0,0,"and , um , if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels , you know , just word alignment , you 'd be able to find that . so so i guess that 's sort of a last ther there 're sort of a few things we could do . one is just do like non - lapels if we can get good enough alignments . another one was to try to get somehow align thilo 's energy segmentations with what we have . but then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation . but maybe there 's something that could be done .",15,0.5,0.11892521381378174
0,0,"what what is why do you need the , um , the forced alignment for the hlt i mean for the eurospeech paper ?",15,0.5,0.08982331305742264
0,0,"well , i guess i i wanted to just do something not on recognition experiments because that 's ju way too early , but to be able to report , you know , actual numbers . like if we if we had hand - transcribed pe good alignments or hand - checked alignments , then we could do this paper . it 's not that we need it to be automatic . but without knowing where the real words are , in time",15,0.5,0.17261600494384766
0,0,so it was to get it was to get more data and better to to squeeze the boundaries in .,15,0.5,0.1469847410917282
0,0,"to to know what an overlap really if it 's really an overlap , or if it 's just a a a segment correlated with an overlap ,",15,0.5,0.09583891183137894
0,0,"ah , ok . yeah .",15,0.5,0.11319299787282944
0,0,"and i guess that 's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of , promissory paper . so , um , if we d it might be possible to take thilo 's output and like if you have , um , like right now these meetings are all ,",15,0.5,0.10541883856058121
0,0,ugh ! i forgot the digital camera again .,15,0.5,0.1578620970249176
0,0,"um ,",15,0.5,0.15226717293262482
0,0,every meeting !,15,0.5,0.17237050831317902
0,0,"you know , they 're time - aligned , so if these are two different channels and somebody 's talking here and somebody else is talking here , just that word , if thilo can tell us that there 're boundaries here , we should be able to figure that out",15,0.5,0.09159901738166809
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1347089409828186
0,0,"because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word . but , um , you know , if there are things",15,0.5,0.15960779786109924
0,0,two words .,15,0.5,0.12746746838092804
0,0,"yeah , if you have two and they 're at the edges , it 's like here and here , and there 's speech here , then it does n't really help you , so , um",15,0.5,0.07293886691331863
0,0,thilo 's wo n't put down two separate marks in that case,15,0.5,0.14134138822555542
0,0,"well it w it would , but , um , we do n't know exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words in this time bin",15,0.5,0.07794065773487091
0,0,thilo 's will . but .,15,0.5,0.0782906711101532

0,0,"that you 're not gon na miss something ,",15,0.5,0.11835542321205139

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08361929655075073
0,0,i think it 's,15,0.5,0.1100008562207222

0,0,to delete .,15,0.5,0.11712680011987686
0,0,"anyways , so i i guess",15,0.5,0.08797776699066162
0,0,ok . that maybe that 's an interface issue that might be addressable .,15,0.5,0.12951432168483734
0,0,it 's possible .,15,0.5,0.09627825766801834
0,0,"but i think it 's the semantics that are that are questionable to me , that you delete something so let 's say someone is talking to here , and then you have a little segment here . well , is that part of the speech ? is it part of the nonspeech ? i mean , w what do you embed it in ?",15,0.5,0.16376550495624542
0,0,"there 's something nice , though , about keeping , and this is probably another discussion , keeping the stuff that thilo 's detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than deleting it . because then when you align it , then the alignment can you can put a reject model or whatever ,",15,0.5,0.15793529152870178
0,0,"oh , i see . so then they could just like put oh that 's what you meant by just put an `` x `` there .",15,0.5,0.15583185851573944
0,0,"and you 're consistent with th the automatic system ,",15,0.5,0.07772506773471832
0,0,"uh , that 's an interesting idea .",15,0.5,0.050612904131412506
0,0,whereas if you delete it,15,0.5,0.17384757101535797
0,0,so so all they so that all they would have to do is put like an `` x `` there .,15,0.5,0.1280720978975296
0,0,"yeah , or some , you know , dummy reject mod",15,0.5,0.0974603220820427

0,0,"whatever , yeah . that 's actually a better way to do it cuz the a the forced alignment will probably be more consistent than",15,0.5,0.1576234996318817
0,0,"well , like , i think there 's a complication which is that that you can have speech and noise in s",15,0.5,0.08320022374391556
0,0,"i mean if it 's just as easy , but",15,0.5,0.17413334548473358
0,0,"uh , you know , on the same channel , the same speaker , so now sometimes you get a ni microphone pop and , uh , i mean , there 're these fuzzy hybrid cases , and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around . it 's not a simple not a simple problem .",15,0.5,0.11639419943094254
0,0,"anyway , quick question , though , at a high level do people think , let 's just say that we 're moving to this new era of like using the , um , pre - segmented t you know , non - synchronous conversations , does it make sense to try to take what we have now , which are the ones that , you know , we have recognition on which are synchronous and not time - tightened , and try to get something out of those for sort of purposes of illustrating the structure and the nature of the meetings , or is it better to just , you know , forget that and tr i mean , it 's",15,0.5,0.16977578401565552

0,0,"uh uh , that 's a good question actually .",15,0.5,0.10768330842256546
0,0,i mean cuz for the corpus it would be nice if everything were,15,0.5,0.1582338511943817
0,0,"actually that 's a good question because we 'd have to completely redo those meetings , and we have like ten of them now .",15,0.5,0.13355809450149536

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1109318733215332
0,0,"i mean , we might be able , at the very worst , we can get transcribers to correct the cases where i mean , you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition 's so poor . right ?",15,0.5,0.1066177561879158
0,0,"yeah , we were never just gon na go with these as the final alignments .",15,0.5,0.08466498553752899

0,0,absolutely .,15,0.5,0.13515084981918335

0,0,"yeah . and um , that 's that bit of news , and the other bit of news is we had you know , uh , i was visited by my german project manager who a , did like what we did what we 're doing here , and b , is planning to come here either three weeks in july or three weeks in august , to actually work .",15,0.5,0.1153934895992279

0,0,"and we sat around and we talked and he came up we came up with a pretty strange idea . and that 's what i 'm gon na lay on you now . and um , maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for eva because she has been known to complain about the fact that the stuff we do here is not weird enough .",15,0.5,0.09812599420547485
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10394927859306335

0,0,uh . { comment } ok .,15,0.5,0.09066484123468399
0,0,oh great .,15,0.5,0.07684142887592316

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14939212799072266
0,0,"it should be possible to make that system produce questions . so if you have the knowledge of how to interpret `` where is x ? `` under given conditions , situational , user , discourse and ontological conditions , you should also be able to make that same system ask `` where is x ? ``",15,0.5,0.11520817875862122
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1174517497420311
0,0,"in a sper certain way , based on certain intentions . so in instead of just being able to observe phenomenon , um , and , guess the intention we might be able just to sort of give it an intention , and make it produce an utterance .",15,0.5,0.1317238211631775
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.07134566456079483
0,0,"well , like in ai they generally do the take in , and then they also do the generation phase , like nancy 's thing . or uh , you remember , in the the hand thing in one - eighty - two , like not only was it able to recognize but it was also to generate based upon situations . you mean that sort of thing ?",15,0.5,0.08960652351379395
0,0,absolutely .,15,0.5,0.11546775698661804
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08278064429759979
0,0,"and once you 've done that what we can do is have the system ask itself . and answer , understand the answer , ask something else , and enter a dialogue with itself . so the the ba basic the same idea as having two chess computers play against each other .",15,0.5,0.07759620994329453
0,0,except this smacks a little bit more of a schizophrenic computer than ai .,15,0.5,0.10593777149915695
0,0,"yeah you c if you want , you can have two parallel machines um , asking each other . what would that give us ? would a be something completely weird and strange , and b , i if you look at all the factors , we will never observe people let 's say , in wheelchairs under you know , in under all conditions ,",15,0.5,0.13691410422325134
0,0,that 's good .,15,0.5,0.10921107977628708
0,0,"you know , when they say `` x `` , and there is a ride at the goal , and the parking is good , we can never collect enough data . it 's it 's it 's not possible .",15,0.5,0.070307157933712
0,0,"mm - hmm . right , right .",15,0.5,0.14859424531459808
0,0,"but maybe one could do some learning . if you get the system to speak to itself , you may find n break downs and errors and you may be able to learn . and make it more robust , maybe learn new things . and um , so there 's no no end of potential things one could get out of it , if that works . and he would like to actually work on that with us .",15,0.5,0.16930639743804932
0,0,"well then , he probably should be coming back a year from now .",15,0.5,0.1041269600391388
0,0,"so yeah , i w see the the generation bit , making the system generate generate something , { comment } is should n't be too hard .",15,0.5,0.074887216091156
0,0,"well , once the system understands things .",15,0.5,0.1595279723405838
0,0,yeah . no problem .,15,0.5,0.10966407507658005
0,0,i just do n't think i think we 're probably a year away from getting the system to understand things .,15,0.5,0.19374655187129974
0,0,"yeah . well , if we can get it to understand one thing , like our `` where is `` run through we can also , maybe , e make it say , or ask `` where is x ? `` or not .",15,0.5,0.11853712797164917
0,0,"mmm , i do n't know . e i 'm sort of have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on , you know , i mean just cuz it 's sort of harder to learn to speak correctly in a foreign language , rather than learning to understand it . right ? i mean",15,0.5,0.11844606697559357
0,0,just the fact that we 'll get the point is that getting it to understand one construction does n't mean that it will n always know exactly when it 's correct to use that construction . right ?,15,0.5,0.14283587038516998
0,0,"it 's it 's uh well , i 've i 've done generation and language production research for fo four four and a half years . and so it 's it 's you 're right , it 's not the same as the understanding . it 's in some ways easier and some ways harder . nuh ?",15,0.5,0.09019485861063004
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12932224571704865
0,0,"but , um , i think it 'd be fun to look at it , or into that question .",15,0.5,0.0852658748626709
0,0,"nnn , yeah .",15,0.5,0.08360358327627182
0,0,it 's a pretty strange idea . and so that 's that 's but,15,0.5,0.10876518487930298
0,0,"the basic idea i guess would be to give allow the system to have intentions , basically ? cuz that 's basically what needs to be added to the system for it .",15,0.5,0.20548959076404572
0,0,"well , look at th eee , i think even think even what it would be the the prior intention . so let 's uh uh , let 's say we have this",15,0.5,0.10615343600511551
0,0,"well we 'd have to seed that , i mean .",15,0.5,0.10176228731870651
0,0,"no . let 's we have to we have some some top - down processing , given certain setting . ok , now we change nothing , and just say ask something . right ?",15,0.5,0.12782472372055054
0,0,what would it ask ?,15,0.5,0.06464782357215881
0,0,it would n't know what to ask . i mean .,15,0.5,0.0897507444024086
0,0,it shur,15,0.5,0.15192174911499023
0,0,"unless it was in a situation . we 'd have to set up a situation where , it did n't know where something was and it wanted to go there .",15,0.5,0.11743968725204468

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13382673263549805
0,0,"which means that we 'd need to set up an intention inside of the system . right ? which is basically , `` i do n't know where something is and i need to go there `` .",15,0.5,0.11045236885547638
0,0,"eh , n",15,0.5,0.06931261718273163

0,0,"well , no i guess not . excel",15,0.5,0.11378175765275955
0,0,"s it 's i i know it 's it 's strange , but look at it look at our bayes - net . if we do n't have let 's assume we do n't have any input from the language . right ? so there 's also nothing we could query the ontology , but we have a certain user setting . if you just ask , what is the likelihood of that person wanting to enter some something , it 'll give you an answer .",15,0.5,0.18278682231903076
0,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.2241666465997696
0,0,"right ? that 's just how they are . and so , @ @ whatever that is , it 's the generic default intention . that it would find out . which is , wanting to know where something is , maybe nnn and wanting i do n't know what it 's gon na be , but there 's gon na be something that",15,0.5,0.19034181535243988
0,0,"well you 're not gon na are you gon na get a variety of intentions out of that then ? i mean , you 're just talking about like given this user , what 's the th what is it what is that user most likely to want to do ?",15,0.5,0.08744098246097565
0,0,"well you can observe some user and context stuff and ask , what 's the posterior probabilities of all of our decision nodes .",15,0.5,0.12484198063611984

0,0,"and yes . and come up with posterior probabilities for all the values of the decision nodes . which , if we have an algorithm that filters out whatever the the best or the most consistent answer out of that , will give us the intention ex nihilo . and that is exactly what would happen if we ask it to produce an utterance , it would be b based on that extension , ex nihilo , which we do n't know what it is , but it 's there . so we would n't even have to t to kick start it by giving it a certain intention or observing anything on the decision node . and whatever that maybe that would lead to `` what is the castle ? `` ,",15,0.5,0.08221331983804703

0,0,"but , so what ? it 's still it 's interesting for other reasons .",15,0.5,0.11662167310714722
0,0,ok . yeah . just wanted to know .,15,0.5,0.08933603763580322

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1353239119052887
0,0,we should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ?,15,0.5,0.14138318598270416
0,0,"oh . yes , we should do that .",15,0.5,0.08398640155792236

0,0,i,15,0.5,0.11458294093608856
0,0,"so , um , i really liked the idea of what i thought was interesting was the combination of the crosspad and the speech . especially , um , the interaction of them rather than just note - taking . so , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? can you do special gestures and so on that that have , uh , special meaning to the corpora ? i really liked that .",15,0.5,0.13152118027210236
0,0,"well , i i just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , um , i i found this discussion very , uh , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . and and the and i and the fact that it 's sort of , uh , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . so i actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . but that 's not really a specific fact . i just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which i thought was worthwhile .",15,0.5,0.13538049161434174
0,0,i had a real revelation about taking pictures . i do n't know why i did n't do this before and i regret it . so that was very interesting for me .,15,0.5,0.10792683809995651

0,0,"i think i think `` pass `` is socially acceptable . but i will say uh , i will actually uh , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , uh , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . so that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , uh , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . so that 's an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data .",15,0.5,0.135317862033844
0,0,"i agree with jane and eric . i think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so i do n't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we do n't have funding on it , uh , in this project . but , um , it 's definitely something i would want to do something on .",15,0.5,0.11121469736099243

0,0,or ? uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.1141214594244957
0,0,"well , being more management lately than than research , i think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . that is , i i really enjoyed hanging out with this group of people today . so that 's what really impressed me .",15,0.5,0.2688620686531067
0,0,how are we gon na find that in the data ?,15,0.5,0.11249163001775742
0,0,"well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time",15,0.5,0.07510969042778015
0,0,"oh , yeah .",15,0.5,0.08513746410608292
0,0,"yeah , i think",15,0.5,0.11751049757003784
0,0,"well , i mean , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot .",15,0.5,0.11840997636318207
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.09230375289916992
0,0,right ? so .,15,0.5,0.0938148945569992
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10122562199831009
0,0,how happy were they ?,15,0.5,0.10066830366849899
0,0,i 'd probably search for something like that .,15,0.5,0.09941215813159943
0,0,that actually has come up a couple times in queries . i was talking to landay,15,0.5,0.09881404787302017
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10170584172010422
0,0,and that was one of his examples .,15,0.5,0.12649600207805634
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10325388610363007
0,0,when when did people laugh ?,15,0.5,0.14643707871437073
0,0,that 's great .,15,0.5,0.0996483713388443
0,0,find me a funny thing that jeff said . yeah .,15,0.5,0.14619259536266327
0,0,so we need a laugh detector .,15,0.5,0.08262404054403305
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10484428703784943
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11357361823320389
0,0,perfect .,15,0.5,0.09558720141649246
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11886908113956451
0,0,cuz that seems to be pretty common . not in the congressional hearings .,15,0.5,0.150191068649292
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.0851212739944458
0,0,quiet sobbing .,15,0.5,0.09609916806221008
0,0,so i think we 're done .,15,0.5,0.10520318150520325
0,1,"and we already got the crash out of the way . it did crash , so i feel much better , earlier .",15,0.5,0.10595342516899109
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11086113005876541
0,0,interesting . hmm .,15,0.5,0.11211397498846054
0,0,"will you get the door , and ?",15,0.5,0.1581028252840042
0,0,"ok , so um .",15,0.5,0.12710417807102203
0,0,"ok . you collected an agenda , huh ?",15,0.5,0.08423391729593277
0,0,i did collect an agenda . so i 'm gon na go first . mwa - ha - ha ! it should n't take too long .,15,0.5,0.15080420672893524
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1518532633781433
0,0,"um , so we 're pretty much out of digits . we 've gone once through the set . um , so the only thing i have to do",15,0.5,0.13243068754673004
0,0,no there 's only ten .,15,0.5,0.10499755293130875
0,0,"yeah , that 's right . so i i just have to go through them",15,0.5,0.10181012004613876
0,0,"well , ok .",15,0.5,0.12478907406330109
0,0,"and uh pick out the ones that have problems , and either correct them or have them re - read . so we probably have like four or five more forms to be read , to be once through the set . i 've also extracted out about an hour 's worth . we have about two hours worth . i extracted out about an hour 's worth which are the f digits with for which whose speaker have speaker forms , have filled out speaker forms . not everyone 's filled out a speaker form . so i extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms and for meetings in which the `` key `` file and the transcript files are parsable . some of the early key files , it looks like , were done by hand , and so they 're not automatically parsable and i have to go back and fix those . so what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with . um , liz",15,0.5,0.10850857943296432
0,0,so you think two you think two hours is the is the total that we have ?,15,0.5,0.11949458718299866
0,0,"yep , yeah .",15,0.5,0.10563107579946518
0,0,"and you think we th uh , i i did n't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right , but you think we 'll be able to retrieve the other hour , reasonably ?",15,0.5,0.16129009425640106
0,0,"yes , absolutely .",15,0.5,0.08340775221586227
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.13350537419319153
0,0,"so it 's just a question of a little hand - editing of some files and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms . i have this web - based speaker form , and i sent mail to everyone who had n't filled out a speaker form , and they 're slowly s trickling in .",15,0.5,0.11182384938001633
0,0,"so the relevance of the speaker form here , s",15,0.5,0.1299208402633667
0,0,it 's for labeling the extracted audio files .,15,0.5,0.1681167483329773
0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.08894506096839905
0,0,by speaker id and microphone type .,15,0.5,0.1392308920621872
0,0,was n't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something .,15,0.5,0.2197602242231369
0,0,"no , i spoke with jane about that and we sort of decided that it 's probably not an issue that we edit out any of the errors anyway . right ? so the there are no errors in the digits ,",15,0.5,0.12542977929115295
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08441919833421707
0,0,"you 'll always read the string correctly . so i ca n't imagine why anyone would care . so the other topic with digits is uh , liz would like to elicit different prosodics , and so we tried last week with them written out in english . and it just did n't work at all because no one grouped them together . so it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else . so in conversations with liz and uh jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings . the problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits . when i look at this , that first line is `` sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . `` um , and so the question is does anyone care ? um , i 've already spoken with liz and she feels that , correct me if i 'm wrong , that for her , connected numbers is fine ,",15,0.5,0.09239803999662399
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13126416504383087
0,0,"as opposed to connected digits . um , i think two hours is probably fine for a test set , but it may be a little short if we actually wan na do training and adaptation and all that other stuff .",15,0.5,0.12794260680675507
0,0,"yeah um , do um you want different prosodics , so if you always had the same groupings you would n't like that ? is that correct ?",15,0.5,0.16405460238456726
0,0,"well , we actually figured out a way to",15,0.5,0.10678990930318832
0,0,"yeah , the the",15,0.5,0.12951374053955078
0,0,the the groupings are randomly generated .,15,0.5,0.1563142091035843
0,0,"no but , i was asking if that was something you really cared about because if it was n't , it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people would n't , uh , go and do numbers so much . you know if it if it 's",15,0.5,0.09683646261692047
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.06911975890398026
0,0,"i think they may still do it , um ,",15,0.5,0.12877047061920166
0,0,"maybe some , but i probably not so much .",15,0.5,0.10825148224830627
0,0,what about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group ?,15,0.5,0.1295108199119568
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.07912577688694
0,0,right ? so if you if if you have uh,15,0.5,0.0720055103302002
0,0,"six dash one , you mean ?",15,0.5,0.1291912943124771
0,0,if you go six six six uh dash uh two nine three one .,15,0.5,0.09681254625320435
0,0,"i well ok i it might help , i would like to g get away from having only one specific grouping .",15,0.5,0.08284588903188705
0,0,"that 's what i was asking , yeah .",15,0.5,0.11889374256134033
0,0,"um , so if that 's your question ,",15,0.5,0.07666557282209396
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15425695478916168
0,0,"but i mean it seems to me that , at least for us , we can learn to read them as digits",15,0.5,0.11779545247554779
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1378495991230011
0,0,if that 's what people want . i i 'm,15,0.5,0.1266167163848877
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11324071884155273
0,0,do n't think that 'd be that hard to read them as single digits .,15,0.5,0.13583610951900482
0,0,i agree .,15,0.5,0.1583116352558136
0,0,"um , and it seems like that might be better for you guys since then you 'll have just more digit data ,",15,0.5,0.10566446930170059
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.09225765615701675
0,0,and that 's always a good thing .,15,0.5,0.16008532047271729
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.13211560249328613
0,0,it 's a little bit better for me too because the digits are easier to recognize . they 're better trained than the numbers .,15,0.5,0.2893572151660919
0,0,"so we could just , uh , put in the instructions `` read them as digits `` .",15,0.5,0.1514037847518921
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.14154721796512604
0,0,"right . right , read them as single digits , so sixty - one w is read as six one ,",15,0.5,0.076439268887043
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1593913733959198
0,0,and if people make a mistake we,15,0.5,0.15002696216106415
0,0,how about `` o `` versus `` zero `` ?,15,0.5,0.12407374382019043
0,0,"i mean , the other thing is we could just bag it because it 's it 's it 's - i 'm not worrying about it i mean , because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from ogi . i 'm sorry , digits numbers training that we have from ogi , we 've done lots and lots of studies with that . and um .",15,0.5,0.11272957175970078
0,0,but it 's nice to get it in this room with the acous,15,0.5,0.09543584287166595
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10464007407426834
0,0,i mean for it 's,15,0.5,0.10449113696813583
0,0,"no , no , i guess what i 'm saying is that",15,0.5,0.09530304372310638
0,0,just let them read it how they read it .,15,0.5,0.11760106682777405
0,0,to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have .,15,0.5,0.14085213840007782
0,0,right . well that 's fine with me as long as it 's just that i did n't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits .,15,0.5,0.1589769423007965
0,0,yeah . we can go back to the other thing later .,15,0.5,0.11834388226270676
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.14391356706619263
0,0,i mean we s we we 've we can do this for awhile,15,0.5,0.10681568086147308
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09411077201366425
0,0,"and then go back to digits for awhile , or um . do yo i mean , do you want do you want this do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ?",15,0.5,0.11480338871479034
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07938720285892487

0,0,"ok , well if you pre",15,0.5,0.09745669364929199
0,0,"but if they make mistakes , it 's no big deal if the people say a hundred instead of `` one oo `` . and also w maybe we can just let them choose `` zero `` versus `` o `` as they as they like because even the same person c sometimes says `` o `` and sometimes says `` zero `` in different context ,",15,0.5,0.10702265799045563
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13102930784225464
0,0,"and that 's sort of interesting . so i do n't have a specific need cuz if i did i 'd probably try to collect it , you know , without bothering this group , but if we can try it",15,0.5,0.18379007279872894
0,0,ok so so i can just add to the instructions to read it as digits not as connected numbers .,15,0.5,0.0857715830206871
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1464427262544632
0,0,"right , and you can give an example like , you know , `` six sixty - one would be read as six one `` .",15,0.5,0.13644669950008392
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.0737987831234932
0,0,mm - hmm . and i actually it 's no more artificial than what we 've been doing with words .,15,0.5,0.13464918732643127
0,0,and i think people will get it .,15,0.5,0.1597939431667328
0,0,"i 'm sure people can adapt to this , read it single .",15,0.5,0.09869295358657837
0,0,"right , right .",15,0.5,0.08631594479084015
0,0,the spaces already bias it toward being separated .,15,0.5,0.1356615573167801
0,0,it 's just easier to read .,15,0.5,0.1019410640001297
0,0,and i know i 'm gon na find this easier than words .,15,0.5,0.08669514209032059
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.06085566058754921
0,0,"oh yeah , absolutely , cognitively it 's much easier .",15,0.5,0.13576489686965942
0,0,"ok i also had a hard hard time with the words ,",15,0.5,0.10604903101921082
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10557171702384949
0,0,"but then we went back and forth on that . ok , so let 's give that a try",15,0.5,0.12102100998163223
0,0,ok . and is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ?,15,0.5,0.24305811524391174
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09162922948598862
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.11140523105859756
0,0,or is that alright ?,15,0.5,0.11005890369415283
0,0,i mean what do other people think cuz you guys are reading { comment } them .,15,0.5,0.18364781141281128
0,0,i think that i it 's fine .,15,0.5,0.06732919812202454
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.06429498642683029
0,0,i it it to me it looks like you 've got the func the idea of grouping and you have the grou the idea of separation,15,0.5,0.06291704624891281
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.18697623908519745

0,0,great . ok .,15,0.5,0.13216382265090942
0,0,and i think there are about ten different gouping patterns,15,0.5,0.15445764362812042
0,0,let 's try it .,15,0.5,0.0945773497223854
0,0,well let 's give it a try .,15,0.5,0.07828312367200851
0,0,"is n't that right , liz ? that we did .",15,0.5,0.1516655832529068
0,0,"righ - right , and you just they 're randomly generated and randomly assigned to digits .",15,0.5,0.10560198128223419
0,0,i did mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12058431655168533
0,0,so we have,15,0.5,0.10431057214736938
0,0,go ahead .,15,0.5,0.12561815977096558
0,0,"sorry , i i was just gon na say , so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of of recordings now . and you 're saying two hours , uh , is digits , so that 's roughly the ratio then ,",15,0.5,0.11419808119535446
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.11706716567277908
0,0,something like twenty twenty to one . which i guess makes makes sense . so if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this .,15,0.5,0.14019478857517242
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.09161685407161713
0,0,"um , yeah like you say , i think a couple hours for a for a for a test test set 's ok . it 'd be nice to get , you know , more later because we 'll we might use use this up , uh , in some sense ,",15,0.5,0.07451224327087402
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11067096889019012
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.07978899776935577
0,0,but but uh,15,0.5,0.10508207976818085
0,0,"yeah , i also would like to argue for that cuz it it seems to me that , um , there 's a real strength in having the same test replicated in a whole bunch of times and adding to that basic test bank .",15,0.5,0.07680657505989075
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11933829635381699
0,0,"hmm ? cuz then you have , you know , more and more , u chances to get away from random errors . and i think , um , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups , and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having uh f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done , which were done by non - native speakers so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set , which is totally american speakers , and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database .",15,0.5,0.156749427318573

0,0,it 's gon na be very hard to be comparable .,15,0.5,0.07685869932174683
0,0,"except that if you have the stimuli comparable , then it says something about the the contribution of setting",15,0.5,0.06693758070468903
0,0,no it 's it 's not the same .,15,0.5,0.15145161747932434
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.12774090468883514
0,0,"a little bit , but the other differences are so major .",15,0.5,0.1073933094739914
0,0,yeah i mean read versus not .,15,0.5,0.09282351285219193
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08594837784767151
0,0,they 're such major sources of variance that it 's it 's it 's uh,15,0.5,0.12457045167684555
0,0,what 's an example of a of m some of the other differences ? any other a difference ?,15,0.5,0.14726263284683228
0,0,"well i i individual human glottis is going to be different for each one ,",15,0.5,0.07804936170578003

0,0,it 's it and and enunciation .,15,0.5,0.1256406158208847
0,0,"i mean the uh the corpus itself . i mean , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list , and i 'm sure that they 're doing more specific stuff . i mean if i remember correctly it was like postman reading zipcodes and things like that .",15,0.5,0.14846834540367126
0,0,ti - digits was ?,15,0.5,0.16089056432247162
0,0,i thought so .,15,0.5,0.08203433454036713
0,0,i thought i thought it was read .,15,0.5,0.09536364674568176
0,0,was it read ?,15,0.5,0.1258758306503296
0,0,"yeah , i think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be ogi .",15,0.5,0.120453841984272
0,0,"oh , i may well be .",15,0.5,0.07675984501838684
0,0,"yeah , no ti - digits was read in th in read in the studio i believe .",15,0.5,0.13533586263656616
0,0,i have n't ever listened to ti - digits . so i do n't really know how it compares .,15,0.5,0.09533341228961945
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.1229635700583458
0,0,but but regardless it 's gon na it 's hard to compare cross - corpus .,15,0.5,0.1617833375930786

0,0,"ok , fine .",15,0.5,0.14352287352085114
0,0,"and they 're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth , so it 's it 's it 's really pretty different . but i think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework , so that even though you could n't do exact comparisons , it would n't be s valid scientifically at least it 'd give you some kind of uh frame of reference . uh , you know it 's not",15,0.5,0.15210218727588654
0,0,"hey liz , what what do the groupings represent ?",15,0.5,0.11613619327545166
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1076989695429802
0,0,you said there 's like ten different groupings ?,15,0.5,0.16692551970481873
0,0,"right , just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line , and number of digits in a group , and the pattern of groupings .",15,0.5,0.12724874913692474
0,0,mm - hmm . are the patterns like are they based on anything or,15,0.5,0.12888117134571075
0,0,"um , i i just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there , and they 're usually grouped into either two , three , or four , four digits at a time .",15,0.5,0.15754392743110657
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.10005936771631241
0,0,"and they can have , i mean , actually , things are getting longer and longer . in the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth . so , there 's between , um well if you look at it , there are between like three and five groups , and each one has between two and four groupings and i purposely did n't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern .",15,0.5,0.11721934378147125
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.11628884077072144
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.12413278967142105
0,0,"and which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly .",15,0.5,0.10884472727775574
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12492640316486359
0,0,"so unlike the previous one , which i d simply replicated ti - digits , this is generated randomly .",15,0.5,0.15323491394519806

0,0,"mmm , oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.14792975783348083
0,0,"but i think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits , whether it 's these digits or ti - digits , to speakers , um , and compare that to their spontaneous speech , and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data because you might be wearing a different microphone",15,0.5,0.1004519909620285
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14241810142993927

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09772127866744995

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14148759841918945
0,0,yeah all we have for some people is digits .,15,0.5,0.14239998161792755
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08907948434352875
0,0,"so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation , and we 're not using the digit data now , but you know",15,0.5,0.10751163214445114
0,0,"oh , you 're not .",15,0.5,0.09046898037195206
0,0,"not for adaptation , nope . v w we 're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on and i 'd as soon as someone started to read transcript number , that 's read speech and i thought `` well , we 're gon na do better on that ,",15,0.5,0.11548065394163132
0,0,oh i see .,15,0.5,0.12418855726718903
0,0,that 's not fair to use `` .,15,0.5,0.06481240689754486

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.11968283355236053

0,0,that would be interesting to see whether that helps .,15,0.5,0.08301258832216263

0,0,like adam ?,15,0.5,0.06286907941102982

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15893323719501495

0,0,same channel .,15,0.5,0.13771188259124756
0,0,"right , and so i still like the idea of having some kind of digit data .",15,0.5,0.21148286759853363
0,0,ok . good .,15,0.5,0.11836576461791992
0,0,"yeah i mean , for the for the um acoustic research , for the signal - processing , farfield stuff , i see it as as as the place that we start . but , th i mean , it 'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data , but but uh the truth is i 'm hoping that we we through the the stuff that that you guys have been doing as you continue that , we get , uh , the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff uh , uh nearfield , and then um , we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield , and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield . so .",15,0.5,0.1230551153421402

0,0,"you could just you could just throw up , you know , uh the uh some mfcc feature vectors . you know , one from one , one from the other , and then , you know , you can look and see how different the numbers are .",15,0.5,0.06422390043735504
0,0,"right . well , that 's why i saying either well , either spectrum or cepstrum",15,0.5,0.09395495057106018
0,0,i 'm just kidding .,15,0.5,0.17837417125701904
0,0,but but i think the thing is you wan na,15,0.5,0.14253592491149902
0,0,i do n't mean a graph . i mean the actual numbers .,15,0.5,0.16998381912708282
0,0,"oh . i see . oh . that would be lovely , yeah .",15,0.5,0.09218648076057434
0,0,yeah . `` see how different these sequences of numbers are ? ``,15,0.5,0.0768309161067009
0,0,yeah . or i could just add them up and get a different total .,15,0.5,0.11232227087020874
0,0,yeah . it 's not the square .,15,0.5,0.1086520105600357
0,0,ok . uh . what else wh what 's what else is going on ?,15,0.5,0.13670317828655243
0,0,"uh , yeah . yeah , at first i had a remark why i am wondering why the pda is always so far . i mean we are always meeting at the beginning of the table and the pda 's there .",15,0.5,0.10469640046358109
0,0,"uh . i guess cuz we have n't wanted to move it . we we could we could move us ,",15,0.5,0.05708574876189232
0,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.13727670907974243
0,0,and .,15,0.5,0.09961312264204025
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07730486989021301
0,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.07664097845554352
0,0,"well , anyway . um . yeah , so . uh . since the last meeting we 've we 've tried to put together um the clean low - pass um downsampling , upsampling , i mean , uh the new filter that 's replacing the lda filters , and also the um delay issue so that we considered th the the delay issue on the for the on - line normalization . mmm . so we 've put together all this and then we have results that are not um very impressive . well , there is no real improvement .",15,0.5,0.07026993483304977
0,0,"but it 's not wer worse and it 's better better latency ,",15,0.5,0.0955330953001976
0,0,it 's not,15,0.5,0.11383526772260666
0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.10232946276664734
0,0,"yeah . yeah . well . actually it 's better . it seems better when we look at the mismatched case but i think we are like like cheated here by the th this problem that uh in some cases when you modify slight slightly modify the initial condition you end up completely somewhere air somewhere else in the in the space , the parameters .",15,0.5,0.09455636888742447
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11316759884357452
0,0,"so . well . the other system are for instance . for italian is at seventy - eight percent recognition rate on the mismatch , and this new system has eighty - nine . but i do n't think it indicates something , really . i do n't i do n't think it means that the new system is more robust",15,0.5,0.15995314717292786
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08351226150989532
0,0,or it 's simply the fact that well .,15,0.5,0.2988928556442261
0,0,"well , the test would be if you then tried it on one of the other test sets , if if it was",15,0.5,0.08245915174484253
0,0,y,15,0.5,0.11961516737937927
0,0,"right . so this was italian , right ?",15,0.5,0.05948939919471741
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.09303662925958633
0,0,so then if you take your changes,15,0.5,0.10373303294181824
0,0,it 's similar for other test sets,15,0.5,0.10703141987323761
0,0,and then,15,0.5,0.13696260750293732
0,0,"but i mean from this se seventy - eight um percent recognition rate system , i could change the transition probabilities for the the first hmm and it will end up to eighty - nine also .",15,0.5,0.1309925764799118
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.0852828398346901
0,0,"by using point five instead of point six , point four as in the the htk script .",15,0.5,0.1681102067232132
0,0,uh - huh . yeah .,15,0.5,0.07887306064367294
0,0,so . well . that 's,15,0.5,0.12441316246986389
0,0,yeah . yeah i looked at um looked at the results when stephane did that,15,0.5,0.09950967133045197
0,0,well . eh uh,15,0.5,0.12638495862483978
0,0,and it 's it 's really wo really happens .,15,0.5,0.09501541405916214
0,0,this really happens .,15,0.5,0.1019333079457283
0,0,i mean th the only difference is you change the self - loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent,15,0.5,0.08185332268476486
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.087593674659729
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15315799415111542
0,0,and it causes ten percent difference in the word error rate .,15,0.5,0.12332096695899963

0,0,"well , we tried we tried point one ,",15,0.5,0.08643202483654022
0,0,f for point from you change at point one,15,0.5,0.07825186848640442
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13201360404491425
0,0,oh !,15,0.5,0.10414901375770569

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11440269649028778
0,0,alright ? um so from point five so from point six to point five and you get ten percent better .,15,0.5,0.08673669397830963
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1037551611661911
0,0,and it 's i think it 's what you basically hypothesized in the last meeting about uh it just being very,15,0.5,0.08811666816473007
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09788767993450165
0,0,and i think you mentioned this in your email too it 's just very um,15,0.5,0.10722007602453232
0,0,"mmm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.1528700739145279
0,0,you know get stuck in some local minimum and this thing throws you out of it i guess .,15,0.5,0.09364344924688339
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1434953212738037
0,0,"well , what 's what are according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ? are they supposed to be point five or point six ?",15,0.5,0.1064407005906105
0,0,"i think you 're not allowed to yeah . that 's supposed to be point six , for the self - loop .",15,0.5,0.08259069919586182
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11010276526212692
0,0,point it 's supposed to be point six .,15,0.5,0.1024516150355339
0,0,"yeah . but changing it to point five i think is which gives you much better results , but that 's not allowed .",15,0.5,0.09992761164903641
0,0,but not allowed ? yeah . ok .,15,0.5,0.09035474807024002
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09751234948635101
0,0,"yeah , but even if you use point five , i 'm not sure it will always give you the better results",15,0.5,0.08763238787651062
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.18099763989448547
0,0,on other test set or it,15,0.5,0.08063235133886337
0,0,"right . we only tested it on the the medium mismatch ,",15,0.5,0.12159290909767151
0,0,"on the other training set , i mean .",15,0.5,0.10527758300304413
0,0,right ? you said on the other cases you did n't notice,15,0.5,0.16785503923892975
0,0,"yeah . but . i think , yeah . i think the reason is , yeah , i not i it was in my mail i think also , is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone . well , in for the mismatched case everything is um using the far microphone training and testing , whereas for the highly mismatched , training is done on the close microphone so it 's it 's clean speech basically so you do n't have this problem of local minima probably and for the well - match , it 's a mix of close microphone and distant microphone and well .",15,0.5,0.061789922416210175
0,0,i did notice uh something,15,0.5,0.154718816280365
0,0,so th i think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training part .,15,0.5,0.11036986857652664
0,0,"somebody , i think it was morgan , suggested at the last meeting that i actually count to see how many parameters and how many frames .",15,0.5,0.09197862446308136
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.07457305490970612
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1274033486843109
0,0,and there are uh almost one point eight million frames of training data and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system .,15,0.5,0.08904222398996353
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.08804599195718765
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1103416457772255
0,0,"so it 's very , very few parameters compared to how much training data .",15,0.5,0.09269808977842331
0,0,well . yes .,15,0.5,0.1029786467552185
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.07861299812793732
0,0,so . and that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually .,15,0.5,0.07297442108392715
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.1121198758482933
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12515276670455933
0,0,"i did one quick experiment just to make sure i had everything worked out and i just uh f for most of the um for for all of the digit models , they end up at three mixtures per state . and so i just did a quick experiment , where i changed it so it went to four and um it it it did n't have a r any significant effect at the uh medium mismatch and high mismatch cases and it had it was just barely significant for the well - matched better . uh so i 'm r gon na run that again but um with many more uh mixtures per state .",15,0.5,0.08429572731256485
0,0,"yeah . cuz at forty thou i mean you could you could have uh yeah , easily four times as many parameters .",15,0.5,0.1220756396651268
0,0,mm - hmm . and i think also just seeing what we saw uh in terms of the expected duration of the silence model ? when we did this tweaking of the self - loop ? the silence model expected duration was really different .,15,0.5,0.09659081697463989
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1494690626859665
0,0,"and so in the case where um it had a better score , the silence model expected duration was much longer .",15,0.5,0.11162343621253967
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11253022402524948
0,0,so it was like it was a better match . i think you know if we make a better silence model i think that will help a lot too um for a lot of these cases so but one one thing i i wanted to check out before i increased the um number of mixtures per state was uh in their default training script they do an initial set of three re - estimations and then they built the silence model and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures and they do another seven then they add mixtures then they do a final set of seven and they quit . seven seems like a lot to me and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time i mean to do one turn - around of the well matched case takes like a day .,15,0.5,0.08965706825256348
0,0,mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1091841533780098
0,0,"and so you know in trying to run these experiments i notice , you know , it 's difficult to find machines , you know , compute the run on . and so one of the things i did was i compiled htk for the linux machines",15,0.5,0.10882547497749329
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1336953341960907
0,0,cuz we have this one from ibm that 's got like five processors in it ?,15,0.5,0.12871555984020233
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.07303044199943542
0,0,"and so now i 'm you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we 've got you know , extra machines that we can use for compute . and if i 'm do running an experiment right now where i 'm changing the number of iterations ? from seven to three ?",15,0.5,0.10751861333847046
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09806506335735321
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11554162204265594
0,0,"just to see how it affects the baseline system . and so if we can get away with just doing three , we can do many more experiments more quickly . and if it 's not a a huge difference from running with seven iterations , um , you know , we should be able to get a lot more experiments done .",15,0.5,0.0883358046412468
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.09655163437128067
0,0,"and so . i 'll let you know what what happens with that . but if we can you know , run all of these back - ends f with many fewer iterations and on linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done .",15,0.5,0.089889295399189
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1321428269147873
0,0,so . so i wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before i increased the number of gaussians .,15,0.5,0.1276036649942398
0,0,"right . sorry . so um , how 's it going on the",15,0.5,0.11945856362581253
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.1595800369977951
0,0,so . you you did some things . they did n't improve things in a way that convinced you you 'd substantially improved anything .,15,0.5,0.12744659185409546
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.0831841304898262
0,0,"but they 're not making things worse and we have reduced latency , right ?",15,0.5,0.08196663856506348
0,0,"yeah . but actually um actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well - matched case and we just noticed that yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny . it 's not a mean of word error rate . it 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , it 's a weighted mean of improvements .",15,0.5,0.17138628661632538
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08572372049093246
0,0,so . which means that actually the weight on the well - matched is well i well what what what happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference because the reference system is is is quite good for for the well - ma well - matched case also .,15,0.5,0.16996441781520844
0,0,so it it weights the improvement on the well - matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases ?,15,0.5,0.10324019193649292
0,0,"no , but it 's the weighting of the of the improvement not of the error rate .",15,0.5,0.07538457959890366
0,0,"yeah . yeah , and it 's hard to improve on the on the best case , cuz it 's already so good , right ?",15,0.5,0.07181698828935623
0,0,"yeah but what i mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the h hmk 's , uh like five percent uh absolute , and this will not affect the final score almost uh this will almost not affect the final score because this improvement because the improvement uh relative to the the baseline is small",15,0.5,0.11035644263029099
0,0,so they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy ? rather than word error rate ?,15,0.5,0.11111370474100113
0,0,uh . uh improvement ?,15,0.5,0.08227716386318207
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.1351747363805771
0,0,"no , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate ,",15,0.5,0.11128398776054382
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.060574859380722046
0,0,yeah . sorry .,15,0.5,0.08976037055253983
0,0,so if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that 's fifty percent .,15,0.5,0.08073350787162781
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13661335408687592
0,0,"ok . so what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , then uh a even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , will show up as quite quite large in this .",15,0.5,0.12130126357078552
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.0790836364030838
0,0,is that what you 're saying ?,15,0.5,0.09550662338733673
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08883213996887207
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.08423969894647598
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1410266011953354
0,0,ok . but yeah that 's that 's it 's the notion of relative improvement . word error rate .,15,0.5,0.12845224142074585
0,0,"yeah . sure , but when we think about the weighting , which is point five , point three , point two , it 's on absolute on on relative figures ,",15,0.5,0.07866090536117554
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10524071753025055
0,0,not,15,0.5,0.09023798257112503
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14349259436130524
0,0,so when we look at this error rate,15,0.5,0.17480169236660004
0,0,no . that 's why i 've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and and not not at at accuracies .,15,0.5,0.07532964646816254
0,0,"uh mmm , yeah . mmm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.12180671095848083
0,0,it 's,15,0.5,0.08884306997060776
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1092425212264061
0,0,i mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through . it 's just,15,0.5,0.13100510835647583
0,0,well .,15,0.5,0.09437290579080582
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10117267072200775
0,0,"i mean , it 's not it 's not that different , right ? i mean , just subtract the accuracy .",15,0.5,0.09645576775074005
0,0,"yeah but you 're but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different .",15,0.5,0.15778324007987976
0,0,"i mean oh . oh , i see . yeah .",15,0.5,0.13531450927257538
0,0,"if you had ninety percent uh correct and five percent , five over ninety does n't look like it 's a big difference , but five over ten is is big .",15,0.5,0.0726102665066719
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08051729202270508
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09710363298654556
0,0,so just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and getting sense of what was important .,15,0.5,0.07399693876504898
0,0,i see . i see . yeah . that makes sense .,15,0.5,0.12423688918352127

0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.16156470775604248
0,0,well anyway uh . so . yeah . so it hurts a little bit on the well - match and yeah .,15,0.5,0.1383936107158661
0,0,what 's a little bit ? like,15,0.5,0.18720857799053192
0,0,"like , it 's difficult to say because again um i 'm not sure i have the um",15,0.5,0.17451779544353485
0,0,hey morgan ? do you remember that signif program that we used to use for testing signi ? is that still valid ? i i 've been using that .,15,0.5,0.0792110487818718
0,0,"yeah . yeah , it was actually updated .",15,0.5,0.1473134458065033
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09929163008928299
0,0,uh . jeff updated it some years ago,15,0.5,0.11207134276628494
0,0,"oh , it was . oh , i shoul",15,0.5,0.07936029881238937
0,0,and and uh cleaned it up made some things better in it . so .,15,0.5,0.0873933807015419
0,0,ok . i should find that new one . i just use my old one from ninety - two or whatever,15,0.5,0.146253764629364
0,0,"yeah , i 'm sure it 's not that different but but he he uh he was a little more rigorous , as i recall .",15,0.5,0.0808967798948288
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10171914845705032

0,0,worse .,15,0.5,0.09660736471414566

0,0,uh - huh . so that 's six six point th,15,0.5,0.05277106910943985
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.10190891474485397
0,0,"ninety - three point six four , right ? is the baseline .",15,0.5,0.116961270570755

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10123983770608902
0,0,well i do n't i 'm not talking about the baseline here .,15,0.5,0.09788772463798523
0,0,oh . oh . i 'm sorry .,15,0.5,0.10586822777986526
0,0,i uh my baseline is the submitted system .,15,0.5,0.11250216513872147
0,0,"ah ! ok . ah , ah .",15,0.5,0.09644857794046402

0,0,sorry .,15,0.5,0.09749199450016022
0,0,"oh yeah . for finnish , we start to ninety - three point eight - four and we go to ninety - three point seventy - four . and for spanish we are we were at ninety - five point o five and we go to ninety - three - s point sixty one .",15,0.5,0.10100509226322174
0,0,"ok , so we are getting hurt somewhat .",15,0.5,0.08603114634752274
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.08719922602176666
0,0,"and is that wh what do you know what piece you 've done several changes here . uh , do you know what pie",15,0.5,0.06514550000429153
0,0,"yeah . i guess i guess it 's it 's the filter . because nnn , well uh we do n't have complete result , but the filter so the filter with the shorter delay hurts on italian well - matched , which and , yeah . and the other things , like um downsampling , upsampling , do n't seem to hurt and the new on - line normalization , neither .",15,0.5,0.07602888345718384
0,0,i 'm,15,0.5,0.15051819384098053
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.09024703502655029
0,0,"i 'm really confused about something . if we saw that making a small change like , you know , a tenth , to the self - loop had a huge effect , can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff ?",15,0.5,0.07365915924310684
0,0,mm - hmm . yeah that 's th yeah .,15,0.5,0.1087329313158989
0,0,"i mean , especially when they 're this small . i mean .",15,0.5,0.14775627851486206
0,0,"i think we can be completely fooled by this thing , but i do n't know .",15,0.5,0.1250615417957306
0,0,"well , yeah .",15,0.5,0.12176020443439484
0,0,"so . there is first this thing , and then the yeah , i computed the um like , the confidence level on the different test sets . and for the well - matched they are around um point six uh percent . for the mismatched they are around like let 's say one point five percent . and for the well - m uh hm they are also around one point five .",15,0.5,0.1052686870098114
0,0,"but ok , so you these these degradations you were talking about were on the well - matched case",15,0.5,0.10276790708303452
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.0751105472445488
0,0,uh . do the does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases ?,15,0.5,0.05882700905203819
0,0,yeah . but . uh . about the same . it does n't hurt . yeah .,15,0.5,0.11812747269868851
0,0,"does n't hurt , but does n't get a little better , or something .",15,0.5,0.10006274282932281
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.11347535252571106
0,0,"no . ok , so um i guess the argument one might make is that , `` yeah , if you looked at one of these cases and you jiggle something and it changes then uh you 're not quite sure what to make of it . but when you look across a bunch of these and there 's some some pattern , um i mean , so eh h here 's all the if if in all these different cases it never gets better , and there 's significant number of cases where it gets worse , then you 're probably hurting things , i would say . so um i mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with with a different test set , that you 're not jiggling things with . so i guess the question is if you can do better than this . if you can if we can approximate the old numbers while still keeping the latency down .",15,0.5,0.0805644616484642
0,0,mmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.09576183557510376
0,0,"uh , so . um . what i was asking , though , is uh are what 's what 's the level of communication with uh the o g i gang now , about this and",15,0.5,0.10799702256917953
0,0,"well , we are exchanging mail as soon as we we have significant results .",15,0.5,0.09456690400838852
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11947943270206451

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10246444493532181

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12577906250953674
0,0,um . yeah . so i think it 's it 's ok . it 's going,15,0.5,0.14670786261558533
0,0,is there any further discussion about this this idea of of having some sort of source code control ?,15,0.5,0.14418019354343414
0,0,"yeah . well . for the moment they 're uh everybody 's quite um there is this eurospeech deadline , so .",15,0.5,0.09689489006996155
0,0,i see .,15,0.5,0.08740004152059555
0,0,"um . and . yeah . but yeah . as soon as we have something that 's significant and that 's better than than what was submitted , we will fix fix the system and but we 've not discussed it it it this yet , yeah .",15,0.5,0.15687021613121033
0,0,yeah . sounds like a great idea but but i think that that um he 's saying people are sort of scrambling for a eurospeech deadline .,15,0.5,0.11981140822172165

0,0,what is the advantage of that ?,15,0.5,0.13861361145973206
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.05603437125682831
0,0,"well , it 's that by the for the moment we have , uh , something that 's discriminant and nonlinear . and the other is linear but it 's not discriminant at all . well , it 's it 's a linear transformation , that uh",15,0.5,0.16772112250328064
0,0,"so at least just to understand maybe what the difference was between how much you were getting from just putting the frames together and how much you 're getting from the discriminative , what the nonlinearity does for you or does n't do for you . just to understand it a little better i guess .",15,0.5,0.1696382611989975
0,0,"mmm . well uh yeah . actually what we want to do , perhaps it 's to replace to to have something that 's discriminant but linear , also . and to see if it if it improves ov over over the non - discriminant linear transformation .",15,0.5,0.09171135723590851
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.14331641793251038

0,0,"yeah , well , that 's what i meant , is to see whether whether it having the neural net really buys you anything .",15,0.5,0.07133045792579651
0,0,ye mmm .,15,0.5,0.059246160089969635

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.16125670075416565

0,0,so so you know that that that the way that they 're,15,0.5,0.18586863577365875
0,0,and then,15,0.5,0.13936695456504822
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.1447446346282959
0,0,"uh , one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , um , run a good vad , and and determine boundaries .",15,0.5,0.1173698902130127
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12996667623519897

0,0,begin to work .,15,0.5,0.09387874603271484

0,0,hmm !,15,0.5,0.11313982307910919
0,0,"i mean , if if you have , uh , fair assurance that , uh , the noise is is quite stationary , then the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise , get a much better estimate , and subtract it off .",15,0.5,0.08176994323730469
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.15182222425937653
0,0,"but if it 's varying at all , which is gon na be the case for almost any real situation , you have to do it on - line , uh , with some forgetting factor or something .",15,0.5,0.09345395117998123

0,0,"well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum . so one of the things that , uh , hans - guenter hirsch did , uh and pas and other people actually , he 's he was n't the only one i guess , was to , uh , take some period of of of speech and in each band , uh , develop a histogram . so , to get a decent histogram of these energies takes at least a few seconds really . but , uh i mean you can do it with a smaller amount but it 's pretty rough . and , um , in fact i think the nist standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this .",15,0.5,0.09822065383195877
0,0,a couple seconds ?,15,0.5,0.07648132741451263
0,0,"so no , no , it 's based on this kind of method ,",15,0.5,0.12259320914745331
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.12676450610160828
0,0,"this histogram method . so you have a histogram . now , if you have signal and you have noise , you basically have these two bumps in the histogram , which you could approximate as two gaussians .",15,0.5,0.13966715335845947

0,0,"oh , yeah .",15,0.5,0.0970667228102684
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12895049154758453
0,0,so you have a mixture of two gaussians .,15,0.5,0.1148906797170639
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08873757719993591
0,0,right ? and you can use em to figure out what it is . you know .,15,0.5,0.0899924710392952
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09670645743608475
0,0,"so so basically now you have this mixture of two gaussians , you you n know what they are , and , uh i mean , sorry , you estimate what they are , and , uh , so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum . and then you look over the whole thing and now you have a noise spectrum . so , uh , hans - guenter hirsch and others have used that kind of method . and the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial and obvious { comment } is to , uh , uh , determine through magical means that that , uh , there 's no speech in some period , and then see what the spectrum is .",15,0.5,0.08907339721918106
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09213852137327194
0,0,"uh , but , you know , it 's that that that 's tricky to do . it has mistakes . uh , and if you 've got enough time , uh , this other method appears to be somewhat more reliable . uh , a variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio is to just , uh you can do a w a uh an iterative thing , em - like thing , to determine means only . i guess it is em still , but just just determine the means only . do n't worry about the variances .",15,0.5,0.06643035262823105

0,0,"actually , it 's a mmm if - if you want to have a good estimation on non - stationary noise you have to look in the in the future . i mean , if you take your window and build your histogram in this window , um , what you can expect is to have an estimation of th of the noise in in the middle of the window , not at the end . so",15,0.5,0.11665135622024536

0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.12291458994150162
0,0,"since he 's going out of town like now , and i 'm going out town in a couple weeks , uh , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ?",15,0.5,0.19483834505081177
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10105494409799576
0,0,"and , uh and what do we freeze ? and , you know , what do we ? so , um . i mean , this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part . so then there 's something central and there are n't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially . uh , um , and , um ,",15,0.5,0.09570746123790741
0,0,yeah . that 's that 's nice .,15,0.5,0.11979486793279648
0,0,"and then within that , i guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gon na be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . so keep a certain set of things constant . so , um . uh , maybe describe roughly what what we are keeping constant for now , or ?",15,0.5,0.12800224125385284
0,0,yeah . well . so we 've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable . um .,15,0.5,0.14592398703098297
0,0,are you gon na use which of the two techniques ?,15,0.5,0.10061021149158478
0,0,"so finally it 's it 's , um , wiener filtering on fft bins . and it uses , uh , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function , the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion . and after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty fft bins . mmm . and , uh",15,0.5,0.0904541090130806
0,0,"so this is on the uh , before any mel scaling has been done ?",15,0.5,0.13669167459011078

0,0,this is,15,0.5,0.11076164245605469
0,0,it was,15,0.5,0.09427563846111298
0,0,"this this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ?",15,0.5,0.11451522260904312

0,0,"yeah , ok .",15,0.5,0.0866946280002594
0,0,"yeah , so basically we tried different configuration within this idea . we tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering . um . well , finally we end up with this configuration that works , uh , quite well . so we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system .",15,0.5,0.09151728451251984

0,0,"actually , let me int eh , dave is n't here to talk about it , but let me just interject . this module , in principle , i i mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it . i mean , because you you re - synthesize speech , right ?",15,0.5,0.06644253432750702
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11746208369731903

0,0,this is an option that then you can yeah .,15,0.5,0.11868032068014145
0,0,"yeah , i gu i guess my point is that , um , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , uh , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well . but for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you do n't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . and if you do n't include that in the model , it does n't work very well . so in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . and , uh , generate new files or whatever , and and , uh , uh and then do the reverberation part .",15,0.5,0.1510351449251175

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08819897472858429
0,0,"uh , but but , you know , that 'll uh , it 's clear that we , uh we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we ca n't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable . and that 's i mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . and that 's hard enough . i mean , i do n't think we really i mean , we 're trying to deal with that . in a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this aurora task . and we have , uh , the , uh , uh , lda stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . and we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise . uh , even that 's hard enough . and and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category . i i there 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around . but now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . and , um , so dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard . so we have to start since any almost any real situation is gon na have uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we we actually have to think about both at the same time .",15,0.5,0.0711311399936676
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.17167313396930695

0,0,"yeah , well , the , um , the other parts of the system are the the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot .",15,0.5,0.12309160083532333
0,0,"so that 's again , that that 's the wiener filtering , followed by , uh uh , that 's done at the fft level . then",15,0.5,0.0643414556980133

0,0,"oh , we were also esp essentially second , although there were there were i mean , we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems . and so , i guess by that we were third , but i mean , there were two systems that were pretty close , that came from the same place .",15,0.5,0.1424463391304016
0,0,uh - huh . i see . ok .,15,0.5,0.05145518481731415
0,0,"uh , so institutionally we were we were second , with , uh , the third third system .",15,0.5,0.08493989706039429
0,0,we 're so this second that you 're saying now is system - wide second ?,15,0.5,0.1036054790019989
0,0,"see uh , no i think it 's also institutional , is n't it ?",15,0.5,0.1441626101732254
0,0,still institutionally second ?,15,0.5,0.11674827337265015
0,0,"right ? i mean , i think both of their systems probably",15,0.5,0.14469988644123077
0,0,"uh , we are between their two systems . so",15,0.5,0.1253407746553421
0,0,"oh , are we ?",15,0.5,0.08600754290819168

0,0,is it ?,15,0.5,0.07564723491668701
0,0,"their their first system is fifty - four point something . and , uh , we are fifty - three point something .",15,0.5,0.06490488350391388

0,0,"yeah , so so basically they 're all they 're all pretty close .",15,0.5,0.07666955143213272
0,0,"oh , wow !",15,0.5,0.11155720055103302

0,0,"yeah , ok .",15,0.5,0.11499426513910294
0,0,but uh we 'll just be m m working on it at intensity so it does n't happen . we 'll see . should we plunge right into it ?,15,0.5,0.09966505318880081
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08477000892162323
0,0,"so , would you like to",15,0.5,0.10402245819568634
0,0,i think so .,15,0.5,0.15532585978507996
0,0,"so what i 've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this side . commented and what they 're about and sort of the properties we may um give them . and here are the uh tasks to be implemented via our data collection . so all of these tasks the reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there , sometime or the other . and analogously for example , here we have our eva um intention . and these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing . analogously the same on the object information we can see that , you know , we have sort of created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and that may or may not be a problem . we can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node so trying to im um implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever .",15,0.5,0.11628889292478561
0,0,"right , right .",15,0.5,0.06915362179279327
0,0,but i think that might be overdoing it a little .,15,0.5,0.11000090092420578
0,0,"so yeah . so let me pop up a level . and uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same . so what we 're gon na do today is two related things . uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . and decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules . so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gon na only have to choose parameters , but you know , a fairly large set of parameters . so to do that , we need to do two things . one of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount . then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . but we are n't gon na do the probability stuff today . technical stuff we 'll do uh another day . probably next week . but we are gon na worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . and we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with fey on what there should be in the dialogues . so one of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh in here , and have them actually record like this . uh record dialogues more or less . and depending on what fey sort of provokes them to say , we 'll get information on different things .",15,0.5,0.11328212171792984
0,0,"well how people phrase different intentions more or less ,",15,0.5,0.16636554896831512
0,0,so fo - v yeah people with the phrase them,15,0.5,0.0992349311709404
0,0,huh ?,15,0.5,0.0652187317609787
0,0,"and so uh for , you know , keith and people worrying about what constructions people use , uh we have some i we have some ways to affect that by the way the dialogues go . so what robert kindly did , is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh things that that might come up , and , the kinds of decisions . so the uh uh on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values . so if if we 're right , you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions , and it 's not all that many , and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief - nets that will do that . and he has a handout .",15,0.5,0.2458537369966507
0,0,"yeah . maybe it was too fast plunging in there , because j we have two updates .",15,0.5,0.11549710482358932
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1077180877327919

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.06805169582366943
0,0,or have you heard about it ?,15,0.5,0.09858869761228561
0,0,not that much you did n't .,15,0.5,0.12150809913873672
0,0,no . ok . we were gon na put this in front of people . they give us some information on themselves .,15,0.5,0.13032399117946625
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07997585088014603
0,0,then then they will read uh a task where lots of german words are sort of thrown in between . and um and they have to read isolated proper names and these change,15,0.5,0.1252683699131012
0,0,s i do n't see a release,15,0.5,0.1135418489575386

0,0,"alright , fair enough .",15,0.5,0.14634275436401367
0,0,"and um and then they gon na have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . they they pick a couple , say three uh uh six as a matter of fact . six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in heidelberg or traveling someplace and um and they have a map .",15,0.5,0.0915178507566452
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.1519804149866104

0,0,"this is a fictional system obviously ,",15,0.5,0.19585882127285004

0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.1021542102098465
0,0,that 's fey .,15,0.5,0.20950403809547424
0,0,i 've i understand everything .,15,0.5,0.07869093865156174
0,0,and she does know everything .,15,0.5,0.08699248731136322
0,0,yes i do .,15,0.5,0.10815572738647461
0,0,"and she has a way of making this machine talk . so she can copy sentences into a window , or type really fast and this machine will use speech synthesis to produce that . so if you ask `` how do i get to the castle `` then a m s several seconds later it 'll come out of here `` in order to get to the castle you do ``",15,0.5,0.08743993192911148
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12813398241996765
0,0,"ok ? and um and then after three tasks the system breaks down . and fey comes on the phone as a human operator . and says `` sorry the system broke down but let 's continue . `` and we sort of get the idea what people do when they s think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to a human , or know , or assume they speak to a human .",15,0.5,0.12840889394283295

0,0,that 's the data collection . and um and fey has some thirty subjects lined up ? something ?,15,0.5,0.13557851314544678
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08159766346216202
0,0,and um and they 're r ready uh to roll .,15,0.5,0.12197288870811462
0,0,and more and more every day .,15,0.5,0.06802035868167877
0,0,and we 're gon na start tomorrow at three ? four ? one ?,15,0.5,0.12188699096441269
0,0,"tomorrow , well we do n't know for sure . because we do n't know whether that person is coming or not ,",15,0.5,0.13320603966712952
0,0,ok . around four - ish .,15,0.5,0.10897035151720047
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.12850750982761383
0,0,and um we 're still l looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room . um behind our backs . but,15,0.5,0.1145046278834343
0,0,"well , there are these uh uh oh , i see , we have to yeah , it 's tricky . we 'll let 's let we 'll do that off - line , ok .",15,0.5,0.08417749404907227
0,0,"yeah , but i i i it 's happening . david and and jane and and lila are working on that as we speak .",15,0.5,0.08470505475997925
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10386354476213455
0,0,"ok . that was the uh the data collection in a nutshell . and um i can report a so i did this but i also tried to do this so if i click on here , is n't this wonderful ? we get to the uh uh belief - net just focusing on on the g go - there node . uh analogously this would be sort of the reason node and the timing node and so forth .",15,0.5,0.10762688517570496
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.0931919738650322
0,0,"and what w what happened is that um design - wise i 'd sort of n noticed that we can we still get a lot of errors from a lot of points to one of these sub go - there user go - there situation nodes . so i came up with a couple of additional nodes here where um whether the user is thrifty or not , and what his budget is currently like , is going to result in some financial state of the user . how much will he is he willing to spend ? or can spend . being the same at this just the money available , which may influence us , whether he wants to go there if it is you know charging tons of dollars for admission or its gon na g cost a lot of t e whatever . twenty - two million to fly to international space station , you know . just not all people can do that .",15,0.5,0.1019839197397232
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.0918353870511055
0,0,"so , and this actually turned out to be pretty key , because having specified sort of these uh this this intermediate level um and sort of noticing that everything that happens here let 's go to our favorite endpoint one is again more or less we have um then the situation nodes contributing to the the endpoint situation node , which contributes to the endpoint and so forth . um i can now sort of draw straight lines from these to here , meaning it g of course goes where the sub - s everything that comes from situation , everything that comes from user goes with the sub - u , and whatever we specify for the so - called `` keith node `` , or the discourse , what comes from the um parser , construction parser , um will contribute to the d and the ontology to the sub - o node . and um one just s sort of has to watch which also final decision node so it does n't make sense t to figure out whether he wants to enter , view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place . but this makes the design thing fairly simple . and um now all w that 's left to do then is the cpg 's , the conditional probabilities , for the likelihood of a person having enough money , actually wanting to go a place if it costs , you know this or that . and um ok . and once um bhaskara has finished his classwork that 's where we 're gon na end up doing . you get involved in that process too . and um and for now uh the the question is `` how much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our data collection ? `` so um , one could sort of think of you know we could call the z see or you know , people who visit the zoo we could s call it `` visit the zoo tomorrow `` , so we have an intention of seeing something , but not now but later .",15,0.5,0.14584119617938995
0,0,"right . yeah . yeah , so let 's s uh s see i th i think that from one point of view , uh , um , all these places are the same , so that d d that , um in terms of the linguistics and stuff , there may be a few different kinds of places , so i th i it seems to me that we ought to decide you know , what things are k are actually going to matter to us . and um , so the zoo , and the university and the castle , et cetera . um are all big - ish things that um you know have different parts to them , and one of them might be fine .",15,0.5,0.093183733522892
0,0,"hmm . hmm , hmm . yeah the the reason why we did it that way , as a as a reminder , is uh no person is gon na do all of them .",15,0.5,0.10175728797912598
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.08727624267339706
0,0,"they 're just gon na select u um , according to their preferences .",15,0.5,0.0804770290851593
0,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.10728538036346436
0,0,"`` ah , yeah , i usually visit zoos , or i usually visit castles , or i usually `` and then you pick that one .",15,0.5,0.1385951042175293
0,0,"right , no no , but but s th point is to to y to build a system that 's got everything in it that might happen you do one thing .",15,0.5,0.08919865638017654
0,0,they 're redundant .,15,0.5,0.11782931536436081
0,0,"t to build a system that um had the most data on a relatively confined set of things , you do something else . and the speech people , for example , are gon na do better if they if things come up uh repeatedly . now , of course , if everybody says exactly the same thing then it 's not interesting . so , all i 'm saying is i th there 's there 's a kind of question of what we 're trying t to accomplish . and i think my temptation for the data gathering would be to uh , you know and each person is only gon na do it once , so you do n't have to worry about them being bored , so if if it 's one service , one luxury item , you know , one big - ish place , and so forth and so on , um then my guess is that that the data is going to be easier to handle . now of course you have this i guess possible danger that somehow there 're certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they would n't talk about with a university and stuff , um but i guess i 'm i uh m my temptation is to go for simpler . you know , less variation . but i do n't know what other people think about this in terms of",15,0.5,0.12635821104049683

0,0,"oh , well , uh th i think there are two places where it comes up . one is uh in the th these people who are gon na take this and and try to do speech with it .",15,0.5,0.09363425523042679

0,0,that 's one .,15,0.5,0.10971558839082718

0,0,bigger y yeah thi well this is a question for,15,0.5,0.1010553315281868

0,0,"yeah , the this was sort of these are all different sort of activities . um but i think y i i got the point and i think i like it . we can do put them in a more hierarchical fashion . so , `` go to place `` and then give them a choice , you know either they 're the symphony type or opera type or the tourist site guide type or the nightclub disco type person and they say `` yeah this is on that `` go to big - ish place `` ,",15,0.5,0.12229398638010025

0,0,"yeah . well , i think it 's easy enough to set that up if that 's your expectation . so , the uh system could say , `` well , uh we 'd like to to set up your program for two days in heidelberg , you know , let 's first think about all the things you might like to do . so there th i i in i mean in i th i i 'm sure that if that 's what you did then they would start telling you about that , and then you could get into um various things about ordering , if you wanted .",15,0.5,0.12813952565193176

0,0,"alright . so we 'll buy a disk . but anyway , so , um , if you if you can think of a way to uh , point us to th to interesting things , sort of as you 're doing this or or something uh , make your make notes or something that that this is , you know , something worth looking at . and other than that , yeah i guess we 'll just have to uh , listen although i guess it 's only ten minutes each , right ? roughly .",15,0.5,0.10797051340341568

0,0,"right . no , we do n't care about that at all .",15,0.5,0.053007762879133224
0,0,so . it 's actually like five minutes dialogue .,15,0.5,0.08052654564380646
0,0,i b my guess is it 's gon na be ten .,15,0.5,0.1179620772600174
0,0,ten minutes is long .,15,0.5,0.12960512936115265
0,0,"people i understand , but people people you know uh",15,0.5,0.18423165380954742
0,0,it feels like a long time,15,0.5,0.08854670077562332
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08902032673358917
0,0,but .,15,0.5,0.10459849238395691
0,0,"it feels like forever when you 're doing it ,",15,0.5,0.0820406973361969
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.07601016014814377
0,0,but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds .,15,0.5,0.06393726915121078
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13254781067371368
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.133315309882164
0,0,"could be . ok . i was thinking people would , you know , hesitate and whatever . whatever it is we 'll we 'll deal with it .",15,0.5,0.1258590817451477
0,0,"yeah , it 's not and it 's fun .",15,0.5,0.10011080652475357

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08387025445699692
0,0,"that 's great . um but anyway yeah , so i think it 's a good idea to start with the sort of relatively straight forward res just response system . and then if we want to uh get them to start doing uh multiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them an um tell them which things are near each other and you know , any of that stuff . uh you know , `` which things would you like to do tuesday morning ? ``",15,0.5,0.10204167664051056
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11352992802858353
0,0,so yeah i th that seems pretty straight forward .,15,0.5,0.10474666208028793
0,0,but were you saying that,15,0.5,0.10054526478052139
0,0,i need those back by the way .,15,0.5,0.10846644639968872

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07825232297182083
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1037464439868927
0,0,that 's for,15,0.5,0.10484473407268524
0,0,"i 'm sorry , fey , what ?",15,0.5,0.13979655504226685
0,0,that w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ?,15,0.5,0.14132732152938843
0,0,"that 's what i was suggesting for the first round , yeah .",15,0.5,0.10220327973365784
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10130420327186584
0,0,so rather than having zoo and castle .,15,0.5,0.11315127462148666
0,0,"and then , i mean , they could be alternate versions of the same if you wanted data on different constructions .",15,0.5,0.0654333159327507
0,0,"they could , but i but i uh tha eh they c yeah , but uh but",15,0.5,0.07409965991973877
0,0,"like one person gets the version with the zoo as a choice , and the other person gets the",15,0.5,0.1443789154291153
0,0,"you could , but i but i i i think in the short run ,",15,0.5,0.1277994066476822
0,0,"and no , th the per the person do n't get it . i mean , this is why we did it , because when we gave them just three tasks for w part - a and three tasks for part - b a",15,0.5,0.10953336209058762
0,0,right . yeah .,15,0.5,0.10112643986940384
0,0,"well no , they could still choose . they just would n't be able to choose both zoo and say , touring the castle .",15,0.5,0.10068248957395554
0,0,"exactly . this is limiting the choices , but yeah . right . ok , sorry . but um i i think this approach will very well work , but the person was able to look at it and say `` ok , this is what i would actually do . ``",15,0.5,0.055250655859708786
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08729860186576843

0,0,he was vicious .,15,0.5,0.13230180740356445
0,0,"ok , we got ta we got ta disallow uh traveling to zoos and uh castles at the same time , sort of",15,0.5,0.11897387355566025
0,0,"i mean there they are significantly different , but .",15,0.5,0.10883305221796036
0,0,"but no , they 're i mean they 're sort of this is where tour becomes you know tourists maybe a bit different",15,0.5,0.12489418685436249
0,0,"yeah , i guess so .",15,0.5,0.09696909785270691
0,0,"and , um , these are just places where you you enter um , much like here .",15,0.5,0.1111413761973381
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08385685831308365
0,0,but we can uh,15,0.5,0.1165740117430687
0,0,"yeah , in fact if y if y if you use the right verb for each in common , like at you know , `` attend a theater , symphony or opera `` is is a group , and `` tour the university , castle or zoo `` ,",15,0.5,0.0989595353603363
0,0,mm - hmm yeah .,15,0.5,0.10522307455539703
0,0,"all of these d do have this kind of `` tour `` um aspect about the way you would go to them . and uh , the movie theater is probably also uh e is a `` attend `` et cetera .",15,0.5,0.12781719863414764
0,0,"attend , yeah .",15,0.5,0.1285361498594284
0,0,"so it may turn out to be not so many different kinds of things ,",15,0.5,0.12546969950199127
0,0,"hmm , mm - hmm .",15,0.5,0.15301761031150818
0,0,"and then , what one would expect is that that the sentence types would uh their responses would tend to be grouped according to the kind of activity , you would expect .",15,0.5,0.12148326635360718
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1392754167318344
0,0,"but i mean i it seem that um there is a difference between going to see something , and things like `` exchange money `` or `` dine out ``",15,0.5,0.13612987101078033

0,0,"uh @ @ function , yeah .",15,0.5,0.13828444480895996
0,0,"yeah , this is where yeah th the function stuff is definitely different and the getting information or g stuff yeah . ok . but this is open . so since people gon na still pick something , we we 're not gon na get any significant amount of redundancy . and for reasons , we do n't want it , really , in that sense . and um we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people asking , oh , for different things with or with a computer . and so if you can think of any other sort of high level tasks a tourist may do just always just m mail them to us and we 'll sneak them into the collection . we 're not gon na do much statistical stuff with it .",15,0.5,0.14103452861309052
0,0,we do n't have enough .,15,0.5,0.10364162176847458
0,0,"no . but it seems like since we since we are getting towards uh subject uh fifty subjects and if we can keep it up um to a uh sort of five four - ish per week rate , we may even reach the one hundred before fey t takes off to chicago .",15,0.5,0.1451791375875473

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.151678204536438
0,0,you could sort of tag it on to that tour,15,0.5,0.10795371234416962
0,0,or ok .,15,0.5,0.12729418277740479

0,0,right . for this .,15,0.5,0.08737363666296005
0,0,ok . just to be totally clear . ok .,15,0.5,0.09325029700994492
0,0,"well , my visit to prague there were some nights where i never went back to the hotel , so whether that counts as a two - day tour or not we 'll have to think .",15,0.5,0.08244173973798752
0,1,so what 's what 's happened ? i think i 've missed something .,15,0.5,0.12957307696342468
0,0,ok . so a week ago maybe you were n't around when when when hynek and guenther and i ?,15,0.5,0.18602672219276428
0,0,hynek was here .,15,0.5,0.09147734940052032
0,0,yeah . i did n't .,15,0.5,0.11870934069156647
0,0,"oh , ok . so yeah , let 's summarize . um and then if i summarize somebody can tell me if i 'm wrong , which will also be possibly helpful . what did i just press here ? i hope this is still working .",15,0.5,0.15458284318447113
0,0,p - p - p,15,0.5,0.08300378173589706
0,0,"we , uh we looked at , uh anyway we after coming back from qualcomm we had , you know , very strong feedback and , uh , i think it was hynek and guenter 's and my opinion also that , um , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression . but given the limited time , uh , it was sort of time to choose one .",15,0.5,0.17462317645549774
0,0,mm - hmm . mmm .,15,0.5,0.1081220805644989
0,0,"uh , and so , uh , th the vector taylor series had n't really worked out that much . uh , the subspace stuff , uh , had not been worked with so much . um , so it sort of came down to spectral subtraction versus wiener filtering .",15,0.5,0.07487741112709045
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.11608316749334335
0,0,"uh , we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were d uh , completely different .",15,0.5,0.0874653160572052
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.16883832216262817
0,0,"and , uh , i mean , fundamentally they 're the same sort of thing but the math is a little different so that there 's a a there 's an exponent difference in the index you know , what 's the ideal filtering , and depending on how you construct the problem .",15,0.5,0.15005749464035034
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08099175989627838
0,0,"and , uh , i guess it 's sort you know , after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me because um , if you 're dealing with power spectra then how are you gon na choose your error ? and typically you 'll do choose something like a variance . and so that means it 'll be something like the square of the power spectra . whereas when you 're when you 're doing the the , uh , um , looking at it the other way , you 're gon na be dealing with signals",15,0.5,0.1540592461824417
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12110777199268341
0,0,"and you 're gon na end up looking at power uh , noise power that you 're trying to reduce . and so , eh so there should be a difference of you know , conceptually of of , uh , a factor of two in the exponent .",15,0.5,0.10003691166639328
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09800577908754349
0,0,"but there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of of , uh , uh , over - subtraction and and and and and so forth , um , that arguably , you 're c and and and the choice of do you do you operate on the mel bands or do you operate on the fft beforehand . there 're so many other choices to make that are are almost well , if not independent , certainly in addition to the choice of whether you , uh , do spectral subtraction or wiener filtering , that , um , @ @ again we sort of felt the gang should just sort of figure out which it is they wan na do and then let 's pick it , go forward with it . so that 's that was that was last week . and and , uh , we said , uh , take a week , go arm wrestle , you know ,",15,0.5,0.1197582557797432

0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.11256496608257294
0,0,"and and so they so instead they went to yosemite and bonded , and and they came out with a single single piece of software . so it 's another another victory for international collaboration . so .",15,0.5,0.06985735148191452
0,0,so so you guys have combined or you 're going to be combining the software ?,15,0.5,0.04643804207444191
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.09068029373884201
0,0,"well , the piece of software has , like , plenty of options ,",15,0.5,0.1046876609325409
0,0,oh boy .,15,0.5,0.12883034348487854
0,0,"like you can parse command - line arguments . so depending on that , it it becomes either spectral subtraction or wiener filtering .",15,0.5,0.07901687920093536
0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.10898630321025848

0,0,they 're close enough .,15,0.5,0.09662453085184097
0,0,"well , that 's fine , but the thing is the important thing is that there is a piece of software that you that we all will be using now .",15,0.5,0.08518966287374496
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.10279061645269394
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.09490624815225601
0,0,there 's just one piece of software .,15,0.5,0.07729119807481766
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08840573579072952
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12898406386375427
0,0,i need to allow it to do everything and even more more than this .,15,0.5,0.07829153537750244
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08424317836761475

0,0,parameters . yeah .,15,0.5,0.12315521389245987
0,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.14788739383220673
0,0,"yeah , we can do it later . but , still so , there will be a piece of software with , uh , will give this system , the fifty - three point sixty - six , by default and",15,0.5,0.0741748958826065
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11084245145320892
0,0,how how is how good is that ?,15,0.5,0.09407221525907516
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08097784966230392
0,0,i i i do n't have a sense of,15,0.5,0.08944400399923325
0,0,it 's just one percent off of the best proposal .,15,0.5,0.14871467649936676
0,0,best system .,15,0.5,0.1206081286072731
0,0,it 's between i we are second actually if we take this system .,15,0.5,0.0998309999704361

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09735392779111862
0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.1111263632774353
0,0,compared to the last evaluation numbers ? yeah .,15,0.5,0.12140235304832458
0,0,"but , uh w which we sort of were before",15,0.5,0.07515517622232437
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08533763885498047
0,0,mm - hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.1435311883687973
0,0,"but we were considerably far behind . and the thing is , this does n't have neural net in yet for instance . you know ?",15,0.5,0.12804456055164337
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.07782698422670364
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.14312638342380524
0,0,"so it so , um , it 's it it 's not using our full bal bag of tricks , if you will .",15,0.5,0.08313073217868805
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.17754048109054565
0,0,"and , uh , and it it is , uh , very close in performance to the best thing that was there before . uh , but , you know , looking at it another way , maybe more importantly , uh , we did n't have any explicit noise , uh , handling stationary dealing with e e we did n't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise .",15,0.5,0.07965940237045288
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.15782776474952698
0,0,and now we do .,15,0.5,0.08371515572071075
0,0,so will the neural net operate on the output from either the wiener filtering or the spectral subtraction ? or will it operate on the original ?,15,0.5,0.07918018102645874
0,0,"well , so so so argu arguably , i mean , what we should do i mean , i gather you have it sounds like you have a few more days of of nailing things down with the software and so on . but and then but , um , arguably what we should do is , even though the software can do many things , we should for now pick a set of things , th these things i would guess , and not change that .",15,0.5,0.14882370829582214
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.15658427774906158
0,0,"and then focus on everything that 's left . and i think , you know , that our goal should be by next week , when hynek comes back , uh , to uh , really just to have a firm path , uh , for the you know , for the time he 's gone , of of , uh , what things will be attacked . but i would i would i would thought think that what we would wan na do is not futz with this stuff for a while because what 'll happen is we 'll change many other things in the system ,",15,0.5,0.09397374838590622

0,0,so you get to,15,0.5,0.12127837538719177
0,0,"yeah , i will try to explain the thing that i did this this week during this week .",15,0.5,0.11424271017313004
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12228965014219284
0,0,well eh you know that i work i begin to work with a new feature to detect voice - unvoice .,15,0.5,0.06432700157165527

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10738391429185867

0,0,"yeah , i i 'll the spectral shape ,",15,0.5,0.12975609302520752

0,0,"mm - hmm , ok .",15,0.5,0.14787670969963074

0,0,yeah . but um,15,0.5,0.11868003755807877
0,0,it 's not quite better .,15,0.5,0.10292359441518784

0,0,"yeah , i used this too .",15,0.5,0.10992856323719025

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.12732775509357452

0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.1193372905254364
0,0,and also mmm i h hynek last week say that if i have time i can to begin to to study well seriously the france telecom proposal,15,0.5,0.1737722009420395
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.07063590735197067
0,0,to look at the code and something like that to know exactly what they are doing because maybe that we can have some ideas,15,0.5,0.0727636069059372

0,0,but not only to read the proposal . look insi look i carefully what they are doing with the program @ @ and i begin to to work also in that . but the first thing that i do n't understand is that they are using r - the uh log energy that this quite i do n't know why they have some constant in the expression of the lower energy . i do n't know what that means .,15,0.5,0.12978287041187286
0,0,"they have a constant in there , you said ?",15,0.5,0.06446652859449387
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12705664336681366

0,0,uh . uh times the,15,0.5,0.07876937091350555
0,0,then maybe i can understand .,15,0.5,0.13816964626312256
0,0,"well , this is natural log , and maybe it has something to do with the fact that this is i i have no idea .",15,0.5,0.17342233657836914
0,0,"is that some kind of base conversion , or ?",15,0.5,0.11145512014627457

0,0,"yeah , it 's pretty funny looking .",15,0.5,0.12383005023002625

0,0,"let me back up while we 're still on it . the the other thing i was suggesting , though , is that given that you 're talking about binary features , uh , maybe the first thing to do is just to count and uh count co - occurrences and get probabilities for a discrete hmm cuz that 'd be pretty simple because it 's just say , if you had ten ten events , uh that you were counting , uh each frame would only have a thousand possible values for these ten bits , and uh so you could make a table that would say , if you had thirty - nine phone categories , that would be a thousand by thirty - nine , and just count the co - occurrences and divide them by the the uh uh uh occ uh count the co - occurrences between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrences of the phone , and that would give you the likelihood of the of the event given the phone . and um then just use that in a very simple hmm and uh you could uh do phone recognition then and uh would n't have any of the issues of the uh training of the net or i mean , it 'd be on the simple side , but",15,0.5,0.10006260871887207

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15286169946193695

0,0,"well , look at look face yourself with this pr question . you get this you 'll have y this is what you get . and now you have to make a decision . what do we think ? what does this tell us ? and not knowing what was asked , and what happened , and whether the person was a tourist or a local , because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these posterior probabilities . what what we need is a just a mechanism that says , `` aha ! there is ``",15,0.5,0.1544024646282196

0,0,"ok . ok well , the , w uh as you can see from the numbers on the digits we 're almost done . the digits goes up to about four thousand . um , and so , uh , we probably will be done with the ti - digits in , um , another couple weeks . um , depending on how many we read each time . so there were a bunch that we skipped . you know , someone fills out the form and then they 're not at the meeting and so it 's blank . um , but those are almost all filled in as well . and so , once we 're it 's done it would be very nice to train up a recognizer and actually start working with this data .",15,0.5,0.13723886013031006

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.18027696013450623
0,0,"um , so that the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that . and so i have a set of scripts and x waves where you just select the portion , hit r , um , it tells you what the next one should be , and you just look for that . you know , so it it 'll put on the screen , `` the next set is six nine , nine two two `` . and you find that , and , hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format .",15,0.5,0.1317518949508667

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1550856977701187
0,0,"all i 'm saying is that , it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said , and which syllables were reduced . uh , if you 're gon na add the features it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries do n't give you",15,0.5,0.10040168464183807
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1068183034658432
0,0,"because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion .",15,0.5,0.1215125173330307
0,0,right . right .,15,0.5,0.08493948727846146
0,0,"so people purposely do n't add them . so it 's useful to know which variant was was produced , at least at the phone level .",15,0.5,0.14321517944335938

0,0,"yeah u i do n't disagree with it the on the only thing is that , what you actually will end en end up with is something , i it 's all compromised , right , so , the string that you end up with is n't , actually , what happened . but it 's it 's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened .",15,0.5,0.16647541522979736

0,0,"this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever ,",15,0.5,0.07948220521211624

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08906064927577972

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09982645511627197
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11076565086841583
0,0,that 's what i meant is,15,0.5,0.0898846983909607
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10791792720556259

0,0,well,15,0.5,0.08960996568202972
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.0921330451965332
0,0,"so there are some things that you do n't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram ,",15,0.5,0.11093888431787491
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13996480405330658
0,0,but you know what phone it was and that 's about all you can all you can say .,15,0.5,0.09165206551551819
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.18176676332950592
0,0,"and then there are other cases where , nasality , voicing",15,0.5,0.13458122313022614
0,0,"it 's basically just having , multiple levels of of , information and marking , on the signal .",15,0.5,0.08136865496635437
0,0,right . right .,15,0.5,0.07139270007610321
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11000949889421463
0,0,"well the other difference is that the the features , are not synchronous ,",15,0.5,0.08351036161184311
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.0960744097828865
0,0,right . they overlap each other in weird ways .,15,0.5,0.10904762148857117
0,0,mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14296969771385193
0,0,so it 's not a strictly one - dimensional signal .,15,0.5,0.08736477792263031
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10913947224617004
0,0,so i think that 's sorta qualitatively different .,15,0.5,0.081325463950634
0,0,"right . you can add the features in , uh , but it 'll be underspecified .",15,0.5,0.05807048827409744
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.11964527517557144
0,0,th - there 'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features .,15,0.5,0.0935889258980751
0,0,"well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system , that the states were features , rather than phones .",15,0.5,0.11769257485866547
0,0,"and i if you 're well , we we 've probably have a separate , um , discussion of , uh of whether you can do that .",15,0.5,0.13156862556934357
0,0,"that 's well , is n't that i thought that was , well but that was n't that kinda the direction ?",15,0.5,0.10522062331438065
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09719239920377731
0,0,i thought,15,0.5,0.11832328885793686
0,0,"yeah , so i mean , what , what where this is , i mean , i i want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research i have in mind , so it should be something broader . but , the but uh where i 'm coming from is , uh , we 're coming off of stuff that larry saul did with with , um , uh , john dalan and muzim rahim in which , uh , they , uh , have , um , a m a multi - band system that is , uh , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and em , to um , estimate , uh , the , uh , value for m for for a particular feature . ok . and this is part of a larger , image that john dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this . might not be , you know , exact features that , jakobson thought of or something . but i mean you know some , something like that . some kind of low - level features , which are not , fully , you know , phone classification . and the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone and and , you know . you could argue what , what a sound unit should be , and and so forth . but that that 's sort of what i was imagining doing , um , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not . you would n't necessarily have to . um , but , again , i would n't wan na , would n't want what we we produced to be so , know , local in perspective that it it was matched , what we were thinking of doing one week , and and , and , you know , what you 're saying is absolutely right . that , that if we , can we should put in , uh , another level of , of description there if we 're gon na get into some of this low - level stuff .",15,0.5,0.11775828152894974
0,0,"well , you know , um i mean if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , you know , you the the question is , do they do that on , meeting data ? or do they do that on , switchboard ?",15,0.5,0.10891134291887283
0,0,"that 's what i was saying ,",15,0.5,0.09677314758300781
0,0,w well it seems like you could do both .,15,0.5,0.12640906870365143
0,0,maybe meeting data is n't the right corpus .,15,0.5,0.14548765122890472
0,0,"i mean , i was thinking that it would be interesting , to do it with respect to , parts of switchboard anyway , in terms of ,",15,0.5,0.05883896350860596
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11135759204626083

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.16277629137039185
0,0,"it might be a time gain . but also in terms of comparability of , um ,",15,0.5,0.1274206042289734
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11199057102203369
0,0,"well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions .",15,0.5,0.12979638576507568
0,0,what you gain yep .,15,0.5,0.08939867466688156
0,0,"you 'd have it , from the lowest level , the ac acoustic features , then you 'd have the , you know , the phonetic level that steve did ,",15,0.5,0.1377599537372589
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08172108978033066
0,0,yeah that that 's all i was thinking about .,15,0.5,0.11734587699174881
0,0,and you could tell that,15,0.5,0.09044297784566879
0,0,"and , yeah .",15,0.5,0.09360899031162262
0,0,"it is telephone band , so , the bandwidth might be",15,0.5,0.13008679449558258
0,0,"it 'd be a complete , set then .",15,0.5,0.0691109299659729
0,0,and you get the relative gain up ahead .,15,0.5,0.11695048958063126
0,0,"it 's so it 's a little different . so i mean i we 'll see wha how much we can , uh , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing ,",15,0.5,0.1303189992904663
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.07126238942146301
0,0,mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11975683271884918
0,0,"but it it might be good to do what jane was saying uh , you know , seed it , with , guesses about what we think the features are , based on , you know , the phone or steve 's transcriptions or something . to make it quicker .",15,0.5,0.09843585640192032
0,0,"but , might be do both .",15,0.5,0.1321689486503601
0,0,"alright , so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous , but then you could imagine , nudging them here and there .",15,0.5,0.09801158308982849
0,0,"adjusting ? yeah , exactly .",15,0.5,0.09902776032686234

0,0,or well .,15,0.5,0.08999472111463547

0,0,so you yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.13665425777435303
0,0,did you happen to find out anything about the ogi multilingual database ?,15,0.5,0.09329885244369507

0,0,so,15,0.5,0.12506145238876343
0,0,"i mean , we ' r e e the bandwidth should n't be such an issue right ? because e e this is downsampled and and filtered , right ? so it 's just the fact that it 's not telephone . and there are so many other differences between these different databases . i mean some of this stuff 's recorded in the car , and some of it 's i mean there 's there 's many different acoustic differences . so i 'm not sure if . i mean , unless we 're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the in the training database , i 'm not sure if it 's completely rules it out",15,0.5,0.10659228265285492

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.11001645028591156
0,0,"uh , i i i i guess the question is how important is it to for us to get multiple languages uh , in there .",15,0.5,0.07995649427175522
0,0,"yeah , but mm - hmm . um . yeah . well , actually , for the moment if we w do not want to use these phone databases , we we already have uh english , spanish and french uh , with microphone speech .",15,0.5,0.10275731235742569
0,0,mm - hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.16865523159503937
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.12395670264959335
0,0,so that 's what you 're thinking of using is sort of the multi the equivalent of the multiple ?,15,0.5,0.1393095850944519
0,0,"well . yeah , for the multilingual part we were thinking of using these three databases .",15,0.5,0.1367880254983902
0,0,and for the difference in phonetic context that you ? provide that .,15,0.5,0.09514851123094559
0,0,"well , this uh , actually , these three databases are um generic databases .",15,0.5,0.06564969569444656
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1352674514055252
0,0,"so w f for for uh italian , which is close to spanish , french and , i i uh , ti - digits we have both uh , digits training data and also more general training data . so . mmm .",15,0.5,0.16336242854595184
0,0,"well , we also have this broadcast news that we were talking about taking off the disk , which is is microphone data for for english .",15,0.5,0.144084632396698

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12146131694316864
0,0,we could use timit .,15,0.5,0.1320798695087433
0,0,"right . yeah , so there 's plenty of stuff around . ok , so anyway , th the basic plan is to , uh , test this cube . yes .",15,0.5,0.0750274732708931
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10935156792402267

0,0,"to fill i fill it in , yeah . ok .",15,0.5,0.11388369649648666
0,0,"yeah , and perhaps , um we were thinking that perhaps the cross - language issue is not , uh , so big of a issue . well , w w we perhaps we should not focus too much on that cross - language stuff . i mean , uh , training training a net on a language and testing a for another language .",15,0.5,0.10704254359006882
0,0,uh - huh . but that 's,15,0.5,0.14696452021598816
0,0,"mmm . perhaps the most important is to have neural networks trained on the target languages . but , uh , with a general database general databases . u so that th well , the the guy who has to develop an application with one language can use the net trained o on that language , or a generic net ,",15,0.5,0.14977633953094482

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.1277800351381302

0,0,"well . but , no but , y you you pick up the phone ,",15,0.5,0.08958382904529572
0,0,well .,15,0.5,0.18045412003993988
0,0,"you talk on the phone ,",15,0.5,0.07708808034658432
0,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.1963488906621933
0,0,"and it sends features out . ok , so the phone does n't know what a what what your language is .",15,0.5,0.07684881240129471
0,0,"yeah , if yeah . if it 's th in the phone , but",15,0.5,0.13321632146835327
0,0,but that 's the image that they have .,15,0.5,0.15655194222927094
0,0,"well , it that that could be th at the server 's side ,",15,0.5,0.14141125977039337
0,0,"it could be ,",15,0.5,0.0970790907740593
0,0,"and , well . mmm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.09251731634140015
0,0,"but that 's the image they have , right ? so that 's that 's i mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years . but the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the uh , on the phone . so that 's that 's what we 're involved in . we might might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years , but that 's that 's that 's what they 're asking for . so so i think that th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language . now , it 's the ogi , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal . and that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch . and they may very well be right , but i i was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true . if that 's true , we do n't need to worry so much . maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that that that the rest does n't matter . um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh which i i guess they 're starting to look at up there , { comment } training to something more like articulatory features . uh , and if you have something that 's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across , you know , a wide range of languages .",15,0.5,0.0764995887875557

0,0,"yeah , so , um , there 's there 's , uh this is complex . so , ultimately , uh , as i was saying , i think it does n't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language . now , can you include , uh , the the target language ?",15,0.5,0.07553520798683167

0,0,so it 's,15,0.5,0.13490571081638336

0,0,"ye - uh yeah , but , uh these corpus , w w there is a callhome and a callfriend also , the callfriend is for language ind identification . well , anyway , these corpus are all telephone speech . so , um . this could be a a problem for why ? because uh , uh , the the speechdat databases are not telephone speech . they are downsampled to eight kilohertz but but they are not uh with telephone bandwidth .",15,0.5,0.1364050805568695

0,0,or well .,15,0.5,0.0899965763092041
0,0,"oh i see , so your point is that it 's it 's it 's uh the features are computed locally , and so they are n't necessarily telephone bandwidth , uh or telephone distortions .",15,0.5,0.0919814333319664
0,0,so you yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.13665403425693512
0,0,did you happen to find out anything about the ogi multilingual database ?,15,0.5,0.09329886734485626

0,0,so,15,0.5,0.12506146728992462
0,0,"i mean , we ' r e e the bandwidth should n't be such an issue right ? because e e this is downsampled and and filtered , right ? so it 's just the fact that it 's not telephone . and there are so many other differences between these different databases . i mean some of this stuff 's recorded in the car , and some of it 's i mean there 's there 's many different acoustic differences . so i 'm not sure if . i mean , unless we 're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the in the training database , i 'm not sure if it 's completely rules it out",15,0.5,0.10659231245517731

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.11001622676849365
0,0,"uh , i i i i guess the question is how important is it to for us to get multiple languages uh , in there .",15,0.5,0.07995647937059402
0,0,"yeah , but mm - hmm . um . yeah . well , actually , for the moment if we w do not want to use these phone databases , we we already have uh english , spanish and french uh , with microphone speech .",15,0.5,0.1027572825551033

0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.12395670264959335
0,0,so that 's what you 're thinking of using is sort of the multi the equivalent of the multiple ?,15,0.5,0.1393095701932907
0,0,"well . yeah , for the multilingual part we were thinking of using these three databases .",15,0.5,0.1367880254983902
0,0,and for the difference in phonetic context that you ? provide that .,15,0.5,0.09514857828617096
0,0,"well , this uh , actually , these three databases are um generic databases .",15,0.5,0.06564969569444656
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1352674514055252
0,0,"so w f for for uh italian , which is close to spanish , french and , i i uh , ti - digits we have both uh , digits training data and also more general training data . so . mmm .",15,0.5,0.16336242854595184
0,0,"well , we also have this broadcast news that we were talking about taking off the disk , which is is microphone data for for english .",15,0.5,0.144084632396698

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12146131694316864
0,0,we could use timit .,15,0.5,0.1320798695087433
0,0,"right . yeah , so there 's plenty of stuff around . ok , so anyway , th the basic plan is to , uh , test this cube . yes .",15,0.5,0.0750274732708931
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10935156792402267

0,0,"to fill i fill it in , yeah . ok .",15,0.5,0.11388345807790756
0,0,"yeah , and perhaps , um we were thinking that perhaps the cross - language issue is not , uh , so big of a issue . well , w w we perhaps we should not focus too much on that cross - language stuff . i mean , uh , training training a net on a language and testing a for another language .",15,0.5,0.10704224556684494
0,0,uh - huh . but that 's,15,0.5,0.1469644159078598
0,0,"mmm . perhaps the most important is to have neural networks trained on the target languages . but , uh , with a general database general databases . u so that th well , the the guy who has to develop an application with one language can use the net trained o on that language , or a generic net ,",15,0.5,0.14977633953094482

0,0,well .,15,0.5,0.18045412003993988
0,0,"you talk on the phone ,",15,0.5,0.07708808034658432
0,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.1963488906621933
0,0,"and it sends features out . ok , so the phone does n't know what a what what your language is .",15,0.5,0.07684881240129471
0,0,"yeah , if yeah . if it 's th in the phone , but",15,0.5,0.13321632146835327
0,0,but that 's the image that they have .,15,0.5,0.15655188262462616
0,0,"well , it that that could be th at the server 's side ,",15,0.5,0.14141125977039337
0,0,"it could be ,",15,0.5,0.0970790907740593
0,0,"and , well . mmm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.09251745790243149
0,0,"but that 's the image they have , right ? so that 's that 's i mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years . but the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the uh , on the phone . so that 's that 's what we 're involved in . we might might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years , but that 's that 's that 's what they 're asking for . so so i think that th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language . now , it 's the ogi , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal . and that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch . and they may very well be right , but i i was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true . if that 's true , we do n't need to worry so much . maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that that that the rest does n't matter . um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh which i i guess they 're starting to look at up there , { comment } training to something more like articulatory features . uh , and if you have something that 's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across , you know , a wide range of languages .",15,0.5,0.07649976015090942
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09053907543420792

0,0,"yeah , so , um , there 's there 's , uh this is complex . so , ultimately , uh , as i was saying , i think it does n't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language . now , can you include , uh , the the target language ?",15,0.5,0.07553520798683167

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1058054268360138

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10338354855775833

0,0,it 's the main conference call . ok .,15,0.5,0.12099607288837433
0,0,"uh , yeah . there were like two hours of discussions , and then suddenly , uh , people were tired , i guess , and they decided on a number , two hundred and twenty , um , included e including everything . uh , it means that it 's like eighty milliseconds less than before .",15,0.5,0.1174803227186203
0,0,and what are we sitting at currently ?,15,0.5,0.13638824224472046
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.10735226422548294
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09115015715360641

0,0,two thirty .,15,0.5,0.1315896064043045
0,0,yeah . so that 's the system that 's described on the second point of this document .,15,0.5,0.10268247127532959
0,0,so it 's we have to reduce it by ten milliseconds somehow .,15,0.5,0.06854594498872757
0,0,"yeah . but that 's yeah . that 's not a problem , i i guess .",15,0.5,0.10621047019958496
0,0,"ok . w it 's it 's p d primary primarily determined by the vad at this point ,",15,0.5,0.11543489992618561

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14452609419822693
0,0,s so we can make the vad a little shorter .,15,0.5,0.08110757172107697
0,0,"yeah . at this point , yeah .",15,0.5,0.19760772585868835
0,0,that 's,15,0.5,0.10395989567041397
0,0,"yeah , uh - huh .",15,0.5,0.0815967544913292
0,0,yeah . we probably should do that pretty soon so that we do n't get used to it being a certain way .,15,0.5,0.2160172462463379
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08623544126749039

0,0,"yeah , sure .",15,0.5,0.18423783779144287
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12895497679710388
0,0,"well , it was mainly a discussion between hari and david ,",15,0.5,0.08072984963655472
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.12878431379795074
0,0,who was like,15,0.5,0.08992105722427368

0,0,"uh ,",15,0.5,0.07526150345802307
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.0927681177854538
0,0,"mmm uh , yeah . so , the second thing is the system that we have currently . oh , yes . we have , like , a system that gives sixty - two percent improvement , but if you want to stick to the this latency well , it has a latency of two thirty , but if you want also to stick to the number of features that limit it to sixty , then we go a little bit down but it 's still sixty - one percent . uh , and if we drop the tandem network , then we have fifty - seven percent .",15,0.5,0.08397643268108368

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.22733484208583832
0,0,"ok . and i is the tandem network , uh , small enough that it will fit on the terminal size in terms of ?",15,0.5,0.1181425154209137
0,0,"uh , no , i do n't think so .",15,0.5,0.15991845726966858

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10448187589645386
0,0,"it 's still in terms of computation , if we use , like , their way of computing the the maps the the mips , i think it fits ,",15,0.5,0.12275595963001251
0,0,mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08647458255290985
0,0,"but it 's , uh , m mainly a problem of memory .",15,0.5,0.09186208993196487
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08628086745738983
0,0,"um , and i do n't know how much this can be discussed or not , because it 's it could be in rom , so it 's maybe not that expensive . but",15,0.5,0.11166710406541824
0,0,ho - how much memory d ? h how many ?,15,0.5,0.07307114452123642

0,0,"yeah . i 'd like to see that , cuz maybe i could think a little bit about it , cuz we maybe we could make it a little smaller or i mean , it 'd be it 'd be neat if we could fit it all .",15,0.5,0.17239995300769806
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.07787634432315826

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1330357789993286
0,0,"but i guess it 's still within their rules to have have it on the , uh , t uh , server side . right ?",15,0.5,0.08848387748003006
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.12670467793941498

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.1160690188407898
0,0,"and this is still ? uh , well , y you 're saying here . i c i should just let you go on .",15,0.5,0.13737192749977112
0,0,"yeah , there were small tricks to make this tandem network work . uh , mmm , and one of the trick was to , um , use some kind of hierarchical structure where the silence probability is not computed by the final tandem network but by the vad network . um , so apparently it looks better when , uh , we use the silence probability from the vad network",15,0.5,0.1092972457408905
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.251895010471344
0,0,"and we re - scale the other probabilities by one minus the silence probability . um . so it 's some kind of hierarchical thing , uh , that sunil also tried , um , on spine and apparently it helps a little bit also . mmm . and . yeah , the reason w why why we did that with the silence probability was that , um",15,0.5,0.2336520105600357

0,0,i only my mind was some,15,0.5,0.1081644594669342
0,0,yeah . so there is the tandem network that e e e estimates the phone probabilities,15,0.5,0.10366527736186981
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.2606082558631897
0,0,and the silence probabilities also .,15,0.5,0.09131646901369095
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.22911176085472107
0,0,"and things get better when , instead of using the silence probability computed by the tandem network , we use the silence probability , uh , given by the vad network ,",15,0.5,0.1323567032814026
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.2672956883907318
0,0,"um ,",15,0.5,0.1193937361240387
0,0,the vad network is ?,15,0.5,0.14380565285682678
0,0,"which is smaller , but maybe , um so we have a network for the vad which has one hundred hidden units , and the tandem network has five hundred . um . so it 's smaller but th the silence probability from this network seems , uh , better .",15,0.5,0.17702694237232208
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.2044317126274109
0,0,"mmm . uh . well , it looks strange , but",15,0.5,0.08413419127464294
0,0,yeah . but,15,0.5,0.10123287886381149
0,0,but it,15,0.5,0.09960415959358215
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.11612965911626816
0,0,maybe it 's has something to do to the fact that we do n't have infinite training data and,15,0.5,0.1416456550359726
0,0,we do n't ?,15,0.5,0.09511515498161316

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12518443167209625
0,0,and mmm,15,0.5,0.12426342070102692
0,0,are you you were going to say why what made you wh what led you to do that .,15,0.5,0.1480429470539093
0,0,"yeah . uh , there was a p { comment } problem that we observed , um , that there was there were , like , many insertions in the in the system .",15,0.5,0.09564380347728729
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08058848232030869
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.11318749934434891
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.13922755420207977
0,0,"actually plugging in the tandem network was increasing , i i i think , the number of insertions .",15,0.5,0.08760905265808105
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.18296095728874207
0,0,"and , um so it looked strange and then just using the the other silence probability helps . mmm . um yeah . the next thing we will do is train this tandem on more data .",15,0.5,0.12305993586778641
0,0,"so , you know , in a way what it might i it 's it 's a little bit like combining knowledge sources .",15,0.5,0.2101156860589981
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.1739615947008133
0,0,"right ? because the fact that you have these two nets that are different sizes means they behave a little differently ,",15,0.5,0.12151939421892166
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13753487169742584
0,0,"they find different things . and , um , if you have , um f the distribution that you have from , uh , f speech sounds is w { comment } sort of one source of knowledge .",15,0.5,0.12836739420890808
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10843750089406967
0,0,"and this is and rather than just taking one minus that to get the other , which is essentially what 's happening , you have this other source of knowledge that you 're putting in there . so you make use of both of them in in what you 're ending up with . maybe it 's better .",15,0.5,0.12124598026275635
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14189253747463226

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08904552459716797

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13223525881767273
0,0,cuz you were really thinking about speech versus nonspeech for that .,15,0.5,0.1610449105501175
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08554887771606445
0,0,that 's a good point .,15,0.5,0.09667055308818817
0,0,"mmm . uh . well , there are other things that we should do but , um , it requires time and we have ideas , like so , these things are like hav having a better vad . uh , we have some ideas about that . it would probably implies working a little bit on features that are more suited to a voice activity detection .",15,0.5,0.06834752857685089

0,0,yeah . mmm .,15,0.5,0.2159295231103897

0,0,"uh , yeah .",15,0.5,0.04839588329195976
0,0,for a second stream ?,15,0.5,0.102980837225914

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09938511997461319

0,0,"i thought `` hey , you know th `` i my initial thought was `` this is not too bad ! ``",15,0.5,0.1059345006942749
0,0,"right . but you have to you know , if you look at it closely , you see `` well , here 's a place where this one has a big formant uh uh formant maj major formants here are are moving quite a bit . `` and then you look in the other one and they look practically flat .",15,0.5,0.07438864558935165
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.15364784002304077
0,0,"so i mean you could that 's why i was thinking , in a section like that , you could take a look look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say `` oh yeah . this this really distorted it quite a bit . ``",15,0.5,0.1375119686126709
0,0,"yeah . the main thing that struck me in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies . it looked like for the one that was farther away , you know , it really everything was attenuated",15,0.5,0.10361289232969284
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.12909461557865143
0,0,and i mean that was the main visual thing that i noticed .,15,0.5,0.12125968188047409
0,0,"right . but it 's it 's uh so . yeah . so there are clearly are spectral effects . since you 're getting all this indirect energy , then a lot of it does have have uh reduced high frequencies . but um the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed , and and uh we want to show that , in some obvious way . the reason i put the wave forms in there was because uh they they do look quite different . uh . and so i thought `` oh , this is good . `` but i i just uh after after uh they were put in there i did n't really look at them anymore , cuz i just they were different . so i want something that has a is a more interesting explanation for why they 're different . um .",15,0.5,0.13537605106830597
0,0,oh . so maybe we can just substitute one of these wave forms and um then do some kind of zoom in on the spectrogram on an interesting area .,15,0.5,0.11617826670408249

0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.09883413463830948
0,0,"the other thing that we had in there that i did n't like was that um the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh when you listen to it is that there 's a second voice , and the the the the the uh cuts that we have there actually do n't correspond to the full wave form . it 's just the first i think there was something where he was having some trouble getting so much in , or . i i forget the reason behind it . but it it 's um it 's the first six seconds or something of it and it 's in the seventh or eighth second or something where @ @ the second voice comes in . so we we would like to actually see the voice coming in , too , i think , since that 's the most obvious thing when you listen to it .",15,0.5,0.13563288748264313

0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.09586484730243683
0,0,"so the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this , the wall uh process , which contains lda on - line normalization . and it hurts uh a lot .",15,0.5,0.16410499811172485
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.12211105227470398

0,0,you can @ @ .,15,0.5,0.16078735888004303

0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.1937752515077591
0,0,and s channel one is the,15,0.5,0.09676314890384674

0,0,"no , i understand that ,",15,0.5,0.1154869869351387

0,0,what 's the rationale ?,15,0.5,0.12807095050811768
0,0,we yeah . yeah . why why do it ?,15,0.5,0.07339293509721756
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.06691981106996536
0,0,"well , i mean , because everything uh if you have a system based on gaussians , everything is based on means and variances .",15,0.5,0.09375769644975662
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08823665976524353
0,0,"so if there 's an overall reason you know , it 's like uh if you were doing uh image processing and in some of the pictures you were looking at , uh there was a lot of light uh and and in some , there was low light ,",15,0.5,0.07507068663835526

0,0,"and the variance is just sort of like the next moment , you know ? so uh what if um one set of pictures was taken uh so that throughout the course it was went through daylight and night uh um um ten times , another time it went thr i mean i is , you know , how how much how much vari",15,0.5,0.11667554825544357
0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.06818991899490356
0,0,"or no . i guess a better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside rather than artificial light . so if it was a lot if more was coming from outside , then there 'd be the bigger effect of the of the of the change in the so every mean every all all of the the parameters that you have , especially the variances , are going to be affected by the overall variance .",15,0.5,0.09722297638654709
0,0,"oh , ok . uh - huh .",15,0.5,0.11523107439279556

0,0,"i see . ok . so would the major effect is that you 're gon na get is by normalizing the means ,",15,0.5,0.1116706132888794
0,0,"that 's the first order but thing ,",15,0.5,0.11609119921922684
0,0,but it may help first - order effects .,15,0.5,0.11507486552000046
0,0,but then the second order is is the variances,15,0.5,0.12406555563211441
0,0,and it may help to do the variance . ok .,15,0.5,0.11233315616846085

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.13225430250167847

0,0,but the the uh but let me as ask ask you something .,15,0.5,0.07963928580284119
0,0,yep . and it and this,15,0.5,0.16822226345539093
0,0,"i is if if you have a good voice activity detector , is n't is n't it gon na pull that out ?",15,0.5,0.12466700375080109
0,0,"yeah . sure . if they are good . yeah . well what it it shows is that , yeah , perhaps a good voice activity detector is is good before on - line normalization and that 's what uh we 've already observed . but uh , yeah , voice activity detection is not an easy thing neither .",15,0.5,0.0731578841805458
0,0,"but after you do this , after you do the variance normalization i mean .",15,0.5,0.09699762612581253
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12707147002220154
0,0,"i do n't know , it seems like this would be a lot easier than this signal to work with .",15,0.5,0.12154098600149155
0,0,"yeah . so . what i notice is that , while i prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one , well , because you clearly see where speech is .",15,0.5,0.15121705830097198
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09236942231655121
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12844176590442657
0,0,"but the problem is that on the speech portion , channel zero and channel one are more different than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer .",15,0.5,0.09539318084716797
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10488959401845932
0,0,but for the purposes of finding the speech,15,0.5,0.08467324823141098
0,0,"and yeah , but here",15,0.5,0.14551883935928345
0,0,"you 're more interested in the difference between the speech and the nonspeech ,",15,0.5,0.13361534476280212
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.06971823424100876
0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.07933031022548676
0,0,"yeah . so i think , yeah . for i th i think that it perhaps it shows that uh the parameters that the voice activity detector should use uh have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition .",15,0.5,0.060077618807554245
0,0,yeah . so basically you want to reduce this effect .,15,0.5,0.10788389295339584
0,0,"well , y",15,0.5,0.10152626037597656
0,0,"so you can do that by doing the voi voice activity detection . you also could do it by spect uh spectral subtraction before the variance normalization , right ?",15,0.5,0.057878103107213974
0,0,"yeah , but it 's not clear , yeah .",15,0.5,0.15040864050388336
0,0,so uh,15,0.5,0.11084480583667755
0,0,we so . well . it 's just to,15,0.5,0.081582210958004
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08137065172195435
0,0,"the the number that at that are here are recognition experiments on italian hm and mm with these two kinds of parameters . and , well , it 's better with variance normalization .",15,0.5,0.099729523062706
0,0,yeah . yeah . so it does get better even though it looks ugly .,15,0.5,0.0983971506357193
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.08843960613012314
0,0,ok . but does this have the voice activity detection in it ?,15,0.5,0.13334804773330688
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.18666106462478638
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12292340397834778
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.12674438953399658
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.10650701820850372
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.06791561096906662
0,0,where 's th,15,0.5,0.09444423764944077
0,0,but the fact is that the voice activity detector does n't work on channel one . so . yeah .,15,0.5,0.12437248975038528
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.12555573880672455
0,0,where at what stage is the voice activity detector applied ? is it applied here or a after the variance normalization ?,15,0.5,0.11973131448030472
0,0,hmm ?,15,0.5,0.11988317966461182
0,0,"spectral subtraction , i guess .",15,0.5,0.07588861137628555
0,0,or,15,0.5,0.09377778321504593
0,0,"it 's applied before variance normalization . so it 's a good thing ,",15,0.5,0.08327165246009827
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.16219988465309143
0,0,because i guess voice activity detection on this should could be worse .,15,0.5,0.055119533091783524
0,0,yeah . is it applied all the way back here ?,15,0.5,0.19065898656845093
0,0,"it 's applied the um on , yeah , something like this ,",15,0.5,0.1588113009929657
0,0,maybe that 's why it does n't work for channel one .,15,0.5,0.09059461206197739
0,0,"yeah . perhaps , yeah .",15,0.5,0.16871078312397003
0,0,can i,15,0.5,0.09136110544204712
0,0,so we could perhaps do just mean normalization before vad .,15,0.5,0.06422895938158035
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.16948170959949493
0,0,"mm - hmm . can i ask a , i mean a sort of top - level question , which is um `` if if most of what the ogi folk are working with is trying to integrate this other other uh spectral subtraction , why are we worrying about it ? ``",15,0.5,0.08893371373414993
0,0,mm - hmm . about ? spectral subtraction ?,15,0.5,0.07204165309667587
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1469874083995819
0,0,"it 's just uh well it 's another they are trying to u to use the um the ericsson and we 're trying to use something something else . and . yeah , and also to understand what happens because",15,0.5,0.1322392225265503
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09068843722343445
0,0,"uh fff well . when we do spectral subtraction , actually , i think that this is the the two last figures .",15,0.5,0.07258792221546173
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15309807658195496
0,0,"um . it seems that after spectral subtraction , speech is more emerging now uh than than before .",15,0.5,0.09864837676286697
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12191091477870941
0,0,speech is more what ?,15,0.5,0.13007090985774994
0,0,"well , the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the n spectral subtrac subtracted noise portion is is larger .",15,0.5,0.1255747675895691
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09491953253746033
0,0,"well , if you compare the first figure to this one actually the scale is not the same , but if you look at the the numbers um you clearly see that the difference between the c - zero of the speech and c - zero of the noise portion is larger . uh but what happens is that after spectral subtraction , you also increase the variance of this of c - zero .",15,0.5,0.09306726604700089
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11818992346525192
0,0,"and so if you apply variance normalization on this , it completely sc screw everything . well .",15,0.5,0.06809817254543304
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1011507585644722
0,0,"um . uh . yeah . so yeah . and what they did at ogi is just uh they do n't use on - line normalization , for the moment , on spectral subtraction and i think yeah . i think as soon as they will try on - line normalization there will be a problem . so yeah , we 're working on the same thing but i think uh with different different system and",15,0.5,0.09372986108064651
0,0,"right . i mean , i the intellectually it 's interesting to work on things th uh one way or the other",15,0.5,0.2574196457862854
0,1,"yeah . we can yeah . sure . but we have to decide i mean we have to fix the system on this d on this data , to choose the best",15,0.5,0.11475185304880142
0,0,yeah . i right .,15,0.5,0.07439028471708298
0,0,and these,15,0.5,0.12887707352638245
0,0,"but the question is when when do we fix the system ,",15,0.5,0.09509129077196121
0,0,but we could,15,0.5,0.06987606734037399
0,0,do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on tuesday ?,15,0.5,0.07395637780427933
0,0,it d,15,0.5,0.14026890695095062
0,0,"i yeah , ok except that we do have to write it up .",15,0.5,0.07345911115407944
0,0,"i think we fixed on tuesday , yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm .",15,0.5,0.0902860090136528
0,0,"also , so",15,0.5,0.10079032182693481
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.13105542957782745
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.1381794959306717
0,0,uh yeah well . well basically it 's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some some other @ @ .,15,0.5,0.1368587166070938
0,0,right so maybe what we do is we we we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth,15,0.5,0.10867002606391907
0,0,yeah but mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1742335557937622
0,0,but we start the write - up right away because as you say there there 's only minor differences between these .,15,0.5,0.12078266590833664
0,0,"i think you we could we could start soon , yeah .",15,0.5,0.07107914984226227
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09854570776224136
0,0,write up something .,15,0.5,0.10200167447328568
0,0,"yeah , and and i i would you know , i would i 'd kind of like to see it",15,0.5,0.11279924213886261
0,0,um yeah . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14891360700130463
0,0,maybe i can i can edit it a bit uh sure . the my what in this si i in this situation is my forte which is english .,15,0.5,0.11105389893054962
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08215373754501343
0,0,uh so,15,0.5,0.08296393603086472
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.12840954959392548
0,0,uh h yeah . have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ?,15,0.5,0.10640501976013184
0,0,uh not really .,15,0.5,0.09437119215726852
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1059873104095459
0,0,um there is the format of the table which is quite impressive .,15,0.5,0.12812653183937073
0,0,"yeah ? uh i see . yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny . it 's all these little categories set a , set b , set c , multi - condition , clean . uh no mitigation . wow . do you know what no what no mitigation means here ?",15,0.5,0.12495192140340805
0,0,um it should be the the problem with the error channel error,15,0.5,0.11966103315353394
0,0,oh that 's probably the,15,0.5,0.09222687035799026
0,0,or,15,0.5,0.12633968889713287
0,0,this is probably channel error stuff,15,0.5,0.10399065166711807
0,0,"well , you",15,0.5,0.1204436868429184
0,0,"huh ? oh this is i right , it says right above here channel channel error resilience ,",15,0.5,0.07543937116861343
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.19194859266281128
0,0,"yeah . so recognition performance is just the top part , actually . uh and they have yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so basically between development and and evaluation .",15,0.5,0.09348294883966446
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09084639698266983
0,0,"and so right , it 's presumed there 's all sorts of tuning that 's gone on on the see what they call seen databases and there wo n't be tuning for the uh unseen . multi - condition multi - condition . so they have looks like they have uh uh",15,0.5,0.08894293755292892
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12088155001401901
0,0,"so they splitting up between the ti - digits and everything else , i see . so the everything else is the speechdat - car , that 's the multi multilingual",15,0.5,0.10471820086240768
0,0,"yeah , so it 's not divided between languages you mean or",15,0.5,0.11863353848457336
0,0,"well , it is .",15,0.5,0.1162218451499939
0,0,it just,15,0.5,0.12850321829319
0,0,"it is , but there 's also there 's these tables over here for the for the ti - digits and these tables over here for the car data which is which is i guess all the multilingual stuff",15,0.5,0.084599070250988
0,0,oh yeah .,15,0.5,0.1313057541847229
0,0,and then uh there 's they also split up between multi - condition and clean only .,15,0.5,0.11377296596765518
0,0,yeah . for ti - digits .,15,0.5,0.09427489340305328
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.08267442137002945
0,0,"yeah , actually yeah . for the ti - digits they want to train on clean and on noisy",15,0.5,0.08251733332872391
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10715996474027634
0,0,and yeah .,15,0.5,0.12841719388961792
0,0,"so we 're doing that also , i guess .",15,0.5,0.09141407907009125
0,0,uh yeah . but uh we actually do we have the features ? yeah . for the clean ti - digits but we did not test it yet . uh the clean training stuff .,15,0.5,0.12503309547901154
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.11539695411920547
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.10168096423149109
0,0,"well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days",15,0.5,0.07846775650978088
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1155095174908638
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.10982758551836014
0,0,i guess they have to send it out let 's see the thirty - first is uh uh wednesday and i think the it has to be there by some hour uh european time on wednesday,15,0.5,0.08888672292232513
0,0,hmm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10759755969047546
0,0,so i think basically,15,0.5,0.14996400475502014
0,0,we lost time uh wednesday maybe because that the difference in the time may be is a long different of the time .,15,0.5,0.11441972851753235
0,0,e excuse me ?,15,0.5,0.06483186036348343
0,0,maybe the thursday the twelfth of the night of the thurs - thirty - one is is not valid in europe .,15,0.5,0.10288984328508377
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10227715969085693
0,0,we do n't know is happening .,15,0.5,0.08006800711154938
0,0,"yes , so i mean i think we have to actually get it done tuesday",15,0.5,0.05749716982245445
0,0,tuesday .,15,0.5,0.09260733425617218
0,0,right because i i think,15,0.5,0.1281474381685257
0,0,"yeah , well .",15,0.5,0.07022237032651901
0,0,uh uh,15,0.5,0.05572482943534851
0,0,except if if it 's the thirty - one at midnight or i do n't know we can still do some work on wednesday morning .,15,0.5,0.10445616394281387
0,0,yeah well . w i is but is is it midni i thought it was actually something like five pm on,15,0.5,0.12376261502504349
0,0,"yeah , well . yeah .",15,0.5,0.10266590118408203
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08537144958972931
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10367423295974731
0,0,"was like i thought it was five pm or something , i did n't think it was midnight . i thought they said they wanted everything by",15,0.5,0.08238688856363297
0,0,"yeah , five pm .",15,0.5,0.11385390162467957
0,0,"well , so five pm their time is is if",15,0.5,0.10573843121528625
0,0,"not five pm , three pm .",15,0.5,0.07599186152219772
0,0,three pm .,15,0.5,0.09717284142971039
0,0,three pm .,15,0.5,0.12649986147880554
0,0,"alright , that 's six in the morning here .",15,0.5,0.08975644409656525
0,0,it 's d no .,15,0.5,0.07487645745277405
0,0,uh no three three a - three pm ?,15,0.5,0.09258422255516052
0,0,"no , we are wondering about the the the hour that we have to eh i do n't know if it 's three pm it 's",15,0.5,0.13445253670215607
0,0,"oh yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . three pm here is in europe midnight .",15,0.5,0.08469846844673157
0,0,"yeah , it 's it 's midnight but",15,0.5,0.09734906256198883
0,0,"yes , yes , but i did n't think it was midnight that it was due , i thought it was due at some hour during the day like five pm or something .",15,0.5,0.08311159163713455
0,0,"oh ok . mm - hmm . mm - hmm ,",15,0.5,0.13798199594020844
0,0,in which case,15,0.5,0.11392375826835632
0,0,maybe .,15,0.5,0.061688974499702454
0,0,so i i uh well we should look but my assumption is that we basically have to be done tuesday . um so then next thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath,15,0.5,0.07300438731908798
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1614866405725479
0,0,but then then we 'll actually have the new data which is the german and the danish,15,0.5,0.10703162848949432
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08572271466255188
0,0,but that really will be much less work because uh the system will be fixed,15,0.5,0.09804310649633408
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12421823292970657
0,0,so all we 'll do is take whatever they have and and uh and run it through the process .,15,0.5,0.11765025556087494
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14517466723918915
0,0,uh we wo n't be changing the training on anything,15,0.5,0.0916704535484314
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09057720005512238
0,0,"so there 'll be no new training , there 'll just be new htk runs , so that 's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after after tuesday and and uh maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of uh the research .",15,0.5,0.10680623352527618
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12586501240730286
0,0,um you know what things uh did you think of when you were uh doing this process that uh you just did n't really have time to adequately work on uh uh so,15,0.5,0.1002659797668457
0,0,mm - hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.12356676906347275
0,0,what ?,15,0.5,0.10236434638500214
0,0,"oh , stephane always has these great ideas and oh , but uh we do n't have time .",15,0.5,0.11044518649578094
0,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.11263839155435562

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08614487200975418
0,0,i 'm not sure these are great ideas .,15,0.5,0.07914022356271744
0,0,"but they 're ideas . yeah ? oh , that was good .",15,0.5,0.11130113899707794
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08748308569192886
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10123571753501892
0,0,and and uh also it 's still true that uh i think it 's true that that we we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features,15,0.5,0.09794656187295914
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.1623264104127884
0,0,rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out .,15,0.5,0.10217848420143127

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08027912676334381
0,0,some of them are but uh i mean you have something really really wrong and you fix it you can get big and really enormous improvements,15,0.5,0.07981802523136139
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11292998492717743
0,0,"but uh um cuz our best improvements over the years that we 've gotten from finding bugs , but anyway ok well i i think i see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about or or are we done ?",15,0.5,0.10459364205598831
0,0,mm - hmm . i think it 's ok um . we so basically we will i think we 'll try to to focus on these three architectures and and perhaps i was thinking also a fourth one with just just a single klt because we did not really test that,15,0.5,0.11836600303649902
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.07427928596735
0,0,removing all these klt 's and putting one single klt at the end .,15,0.5,0.14659595489501953
0,0,"yeah , i mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it .",15,0.5,0.09804048389196396
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08645498752593994

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1570614129304886
0,0,oh i have yeah i do have one other piece of information which uh i should tell people outside of this group too uh i do n't know if we 're gon na need it uh but uh jeff up at the uh university of washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh ibm machines rs six thousands,15,0.5,0.11089033633470535
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13411183655261993
0,0,"and and uh so i think each one is four processors or something or i do n't know , eight hundred megahertz or something and there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti so if you know he 's got a lot of processing power and um we 'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we wan na wan na wan na run them he 's he 's offering it .",15,0.5,0.14493584632873535

0,0,but but if if we are that 's an offer . ok well uh you guys doing great stuff so that 's that that 's really neat and uh we 'll uh uh g do n't think we need to uh um oh well the other thing i guess that i will say is that uh the digits that we 're gon na record momentarily is starting to get are starting to get into a pretty good size collection and um in addition to the speechdat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now so that 's that 's another source of data . um which is s under somewhat better control and that we can we can make measurements of the room the uh that you know if we feel there 's other measurements we do n't have that we 'd like to have we can make them and uh dave and i were just talking about that a little while ago so uh that 's another another possibility for this this kind of work .,15,0.5,0.12035708874464035
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13584694266319275

0,0,the s action - schemas basically have extra see we so those are schemas exist because in case we need extra information instead of just making it an attribute and which which is just one thing we we decided to make it 's own entity so that we could explode it out later on in case there is some structure that that we need to exploit .,15,0.5,0.1313246786594391

0,0,"source is just not spelled out here . source meaning source will be uh will have a name , a type , maybe a dimensionality ,",15,0.5,0.09306024760007858

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12371533364057541

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08508054912090302
0,0,and then g the same about goals .,15,0.5,0.08184626698493958
0,0,"ok . so i guess the question is when you actually fill one of these out , it 'll be under action schema ? those are it 's gon na be one y you 'll pick one of those for",15,0.5,0.09552493691444397
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.1372290998697281
0,0,ok these are this is just a layout of the possible that could go play that role .,15,0.5,0.13503418862819672
0,0,"right , so the the the roles will be filled in with the schema",15,0.5,0.07086572051048279

0,0,"ok , go it . uh - huh .",15,0.5,0.0973372757434845
0,0,and then what actual a action is chosen is will be in the in the action schema section .,15,0.5,0.23572593927383423
0,0,"ok . ok . s s ok , so one question . this was in this case it 's all um clear , sort of obvious , but you can think of the enter , view and approach as each having their roles , right ? the i mean it 's it 's implicit that the person that 's moving is doing entering viewing and approaching , but you know the usual thing is we have bindings between sort of they 're sort of like action specific roles and the more general source - path - goal specific roles . so are we worrying about that or not for now ?",15,0.5,0.14321915805339813

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10244100540876389
0,0,tell us more about it .,15,0.5,0.09342284500598907
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08918660879135132
0,0,what do you what do you,15,0.5,0.11478767544031143
0,0,what 's that ? oh i guess it i i may be just um reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that i 've always viewed things,15,0.5,0.09402545541524887
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.12413455545902252
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.1291886568069458
0,0,"and that that may or may not be what you guys intended . but if it is , then the top block is sort of like um , you know , you have to list exactly what x - schema or in this action schema , there 'll be a certain one , that has its own s structure and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching , but those could include roles like the thing that you 're viewing , the thing that you 're entering , the thing that you 're",15,0.5,0.16744232177734375

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11120646446943283

0,0,"mm - hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm , mm - hmm .",15,0.5,0.16625641286373138
0,0,or how do they work in f terms of other things . so all of those have um basically f either specific frame specific roles or more general frame specific roles that might have binding . so the question is are um how to represent when things are linked in a certain way . so we know for enter that there 's container potentially involved,15,0.5,0.1422422081232071
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10995077341794968
0,0,and it 's not uh i do n't know if you wan na have in the same level as the action schema spg schema it it 's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the source - path - goal um you know goal uh goal i guess in this case .,15,0.5,0.0863354504108429
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1318482905626297
0,0,so uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there 's identity basically between things,15,0.5,0.13213326036930084
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10979286581277847

0,0,so it 's g it 's the spec is there and it 's gon na part of the m - three - l ap api filed by the end of this year so that this means we can start using it basically now . but this is a technical detail .,15,0.5,0.10123959928750992

0,0,yeah i i,15,0.5,0.14370067417621613
0,0,yeah ? so uh so we would we would instantiate the spg schema with a source - path - goal blah - blah - blah,15,0.5,0.11225934326648712

0,0,"right . yeah , yeah . so . so . ok . so there 's like levels of granularity . so uh there 's there 's um a single event of which they are both a part . and they 're independently they they are events which have very different characters as far as source - path - goal whatever .",15,0.5,0.09174297749996185

0,0,like i i,15,0.5,0.14288131892681122
0,0,and as i prefaced it this is the result of one week of arguing about it,15,0.5,0.08891421556472778
0,0,mm - hmm . between you guys,15,0.5,0.13838127255439758
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09132465720176697
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.07880982756614685
0,0,and um and so,15,0.5,0.12190555781126022
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.07666308432817459
0,0,yeah i mean i i still am not entirely sure that i really fully grasp the syntax of this .,15,0.5,0.10536296665668488
0,0,"well it 's not it 's not actually a very actually , it does n't actually",15,0.5,0.13340963423252106
0,0,um it occur it occurs to me that i mean ne,15,0.5,0.1243763267993927
0,0,"you know , like what right . or the intended interpretation of this .",15,0.5,0.12974300980567932
0,0,"um well i should have we should have added an ano an xml example ,",15,0.5,0.11622418463230133
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10368343442678452

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.07642961293458939
0,0,yeah that would be that would be nice .,15,0.5,0.1535613089799881
0,0,and and this is on on a on on my list of things until next next week .,15,0.5,0.13822662830352783
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09040986746549606
0,0,it 's also a question of the recursiveness and and a hier hierarchy um in there .,15,0.5,0.07280344516038895
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.13226233422756195
0,0,"do we want the schemas just blump blump blump blump ? i mean it 's if we can actually you know get it so that we can , out of one utterance , activate more than one schema , i mean , then we 're already pretty good ,",15,0.5,0.08677773177623749
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09832974523305893
0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.09680788218975067
0,0,well well you have to be careful with that uh uh thing because uh i mean many actions presuppose some um almost infinitely many other actions . so if you go to a bakery you have a general intention of uh not being hungry .,15,0.5,0.09448988735675812
0,0,yeah . mayb - yeah .,15,0.5,0.13282985985279083
0,0,you have a specific intentions to cross the traffic light to get there .,15,0.5,0.08586643636226654
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08128317445516586
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14580050110816956
0,0,you have a further specific intentions to left to lift your right foot,15,0.5,0.11317738145589828
0,0,hmm ?,15,0.5,0.0844494104385376
0,0,and so uh uh i mean y you really have to focus on on on,15,0.5,0.0915820375084877
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11972270905971527
0,0,"and decide the level of of abstraction that that you aim at it kind of zero in on that ,",15,0.5,0.10935552418231964
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09627444297075272
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08602412790060043
0,0,"and more or less ignore the rest , unless there is some implications that that you want to constant draw from from sub - tasks um that are relevant uh i mean but very difficult .",15,0.5,0.14545021951198578
0,0,m th the other thing that i just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you 're supposed to meet your friend there or som,15,0.5,0.11382211744785309
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.06938213109970093
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1434178501367569
0,0,you know so you like being able to infer the second thing is very useful and probably often right .,15,0.5,0.1824362576007843
0,0,"well the the the utterance was `` is there a bakery around here ? `` ,",15,0.5,0.14175674319267273
0,0,but having them separate,15,0.5,0.09424354135990143
0,0,not `` i want to go to a bakery . ``,15,0.5,0.1545507311820984
0,0,well maybe their friend said they were going to meet them in a bakery around the area .,15,0.5,0.09454882144927979
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08455365896224976
0,0,"and i 'm , yeah i 'm i 'm inventing contexts which are maybe unlikely ,",15,0.5,0.11892230063676834
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.07813341915607452
0,0,sure it ok . yeah .,15,0.5,0.14835932850837708
0,0,but yeah i mean like but it 's still the case that um you could you could override that default by giving extra information,15,0.5,0.09587105363607407
0,0,"mm - hmm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.09406338632106781
0,0,"which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of `` ok they really want to know if there 's a bakery around here `` ,",15,0.5,0.12346336990594864
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.07742516696453094
0,0,which is direct .,15,0.5,0.1128024235367775

0,0,mm - hmm . yep .,15,0.5,0.10095072537660599
0,0,well . i have a question about the slot of the spg action .,15,0.5,0.10993547737598419
0,0,yeah . it 's like,15,0.5,0.10767252743244171
0,0,"so the enter - view - approach the the the eva um , those are fixed slots in this particular action . every action of this kind will have a choice . or or or or will it just um uh is it change",15,0.5,0.12303703278303146

0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.10203447937965393
0,0,so so i i mean for for each particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some number of slots that define uh uh uh you know in some way what this action is all about .,15,0.5,0.12161537259817123
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.08936470746994019
0,0,"it can be either a , b or c . um . so is it a fixed number or or do you leave it open it could be between one and fifteen uh it 's it 's it 's flexible .",15,0.5,0.06935786455869675
0,0,"um , the uh well , it sort of depends on on if you actually write down the the schema then you have to say it 's either one of them or it can be none , or it can be any of them . however the uh it seems to be sensible to me to r to view them as mutually exclusive um maybe even not .",15,0.5,0.10953062772750854

0,0,uh ye uh uh b i uh i u i understand,15,0.5,0.07051980495452881

0,0,"no , no . there a a actually by i think my question is simpler than that , um is ok , so you have an spg action and and it has three different um uh aspects um because you can either enter a building or view it or or approach it and touch it or something . um now you define uh another action , it 's it 's called um uh s s p g - one",15,0.5,0.10916577279567719

0,0,"so , tell me about it .",15,0.5,0.08990955352783203

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.1538362205028534

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09299241006374359

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1279360055923462

0,0,"um , the second sheet is abo uh , about the same . it 's the same , um , idea but it 's working on mel bands , and it 's a spectral subtraction instead of wiener filter , and there is also a noise addition after , uh , cleaning up the mel bins . mmm . well , the results are similar .",15,0.5,0.08456908911466599

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.11608944088220596

0,0,"and , uh , i guess it 's sort you know , after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me because um , if you 're dealing with power spectra then how are you gon na choose your error ? and typically you 'll do choose something like a variance . and so that means it 'll be something like the square of the power spectra . whereas when you 're when you 're doing the the , uh , um , looking at it the other way , you 're gon na be dealing with signals",15,0.5,0.1540585607290268

0,0,oh boy .,15,0.5,0.09184112399816513

0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.07925937324762344
0,0,so this,15,0.5,0.17291896045207977
0,0,which could be a kind of a funny delta . right ?,15,0.5,0.08553201705217361
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1072709932923317
0,0,"oh , oh . so that 's fixed in this . yeah , we talked about that .",15,0.5,0.09813898056745529
0,0,yeah . so we have no delta . and then,15,0.5,0.09833594411611557
0,0,yeah . uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.1103074848651886
0,1,yeah . yeah . the same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from . right ?,15,0.5,0.22880567610263824
0,0,"could we do exactly the same thing that we 're doing now , but do it with a far - field mike ?",15,0.5,0.10974735021591187
0,0,"yeah , do it with one of on",15,0.5,0.13403098285198212
0,0,"cuz we extract the times from the near - field mike , but you use the acoustics from the far - field mike .",15,0.5,0.15493085980415344
0,0,"right . i understand that . i just meant that so you have three choices . there 's , um you can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were were synchronized . or you can do a forced alignment on the close - talking to determine that , the you know , within this segment , these really were the times that this person was talking and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping and just front - end those pieces . or you can run it on the whole data , which is which is , you know , a",15,0.5,0.1432632952928543
0,0,"but but but how did we get the how did we determine the links , uh , that we 're testing on in the stuff we reported ?",15,0.5,0.08974668383598328
0,0,"in the h l t paper we took segments that are channel time - aligned , which is now h being changed in the transcription process , which is good , and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here , because no one else had time any words in that segment and called that `` non - overlap `` .",15,0.5,0.1161096841096878
0,0,and tha and that 's what we were getting those numbers from .,15,0.5,0.08914466947317123
0,0,yes . tho - good the good numbers .,15,0.5,0.10853490233421326
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.121009461581707
0,0,the bad numbers were from the segments where there was overlap .,15,0.5,0.11362715065479279

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.16630880534648895
0,0,"but anyway so i think that we should try it once with the same conditions that were used to create those , and in those same segments just use one of the p z",15,0.5,0.11255078762769699
0,0,right . so we we can do that . yeah .,15,0.5,0.06958001106977463
0,0,"and then , you know , i mean , the thing is if we were getting , uh what , thirty - five , forty percent , something like that on on that particular set , uh , does it go to seventy or eighty ?",15,0.5,0.056280508637428284
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.12102565914392471
0,0,"or , does it use up so much memory we ca n't decode it ?",15,0.5,0.08377914875745773
0,0,it might also depend on which speaker th it is and how close they are to the pzm ?,15,0.5,0.052210014313459396

0,0,i do n't know how different they are from each other .,15,0.5,0.121825210750103
0,0,you want to probably choose the pzm channel that is closest to the speaker .,15,0.5,0.07298076897859573

0,0,"ok . so we would then use that one , too ,",15,0.5,0.09508150815963745

0,0,"you know , it 's so i but i would i 'd pick that one . it 'll be less good for some people than for other , but i i 'd like to see it on the same exact same data set that that we did the other thing on .",15,0.5,0.06951721012592316

0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.1568835824728012
0,0,because that could be why the pda is worse . because it 's further away from most of the people reading digits .,15,0.5,0.1401909738779068
0,0,it 's further away . yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.09344662725925446
0,0,that 's probably one of the reasons .,15,0.5,0.1245114654302597
0,0,hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08849284052848816

0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.09217798709869385
0,0,"but the other is , it 's very , uh i mean , even though there 's i 'm sure the f f the the sri , uh , front - end has some kind of pre - emphasis , it 's it 's , uh still , th it 's picking up lots of low - frequency energy .",15,0.5,0.1315692812204361

0,0,"so , even discriminating against it , i 'm sure some of it 's getting through . um . but , yeah , you 're right . prob - a part of it is just the distance .",15,0.5,0.13682611286640167

0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.10935176908969879
0,0,i mean,15,0.5,0.13693755865097046
0,0,"well , they 're bad . but , i mean , if you listen to it , it sounds ok . you know ? u yeah .",15,0.5,0.10990951210260391
0,0,"yeah . when you listen to it , uh , the pzm and the pda yeah , th the pda has higher sound floor but not by a lot . it 's really pretty uh , pretty much the same .",15,0.5,0.1298733502626419
0,0,i just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose . cheap in terms of their quality . so .,15,0.5,0.11006301641464233
0,0,"well , they 're twenty - five cents or so .",15,0.5,0.07956024259328842
0,0,th - we wanted them to be to be typical of what would be in a pda .,15,0.5,0.07533145695924759
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08734552562236786
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11298510432243347
0,0,"so they are they 're not the pzm three hundred dollar type . they 're the twenty - five cent ,",15,0.5,0.07725577056407928
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1401195526123047
0,0,buy them in packs of thousand type .,15,0.5,0.12469049543142319
0,0,i see .,15,0.5,0.14748013019561768
0,0,"but , i mean , the thing is people use those little mikes for everything because they 're really not bad .",15,0.5,0.14139871299266815
0,0,everything .,15,0.5,0.07615882903337479

0,0,"i mean , if you 're not doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer , they they they you know , you can hear the sou hear the sounds just fine .",15,0.5,0.10100899636745453
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.12361787259578705
0,0,"you know , it 's they i mean , i it 's more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under , it 's just that there 's less quality control . they just , you know , churn them out and do n't check them . um . so . so that was yeah . so that was i interesting result . so like i said , the front - end guys are very much interested in in this is as as well and",15,0.5,0.11943048238754272
0,0,"so so , but where is this now ? i mean , what 's where do we go from here ?",15,0.5,0.10620211064815521
0,0,yeah . that was gon na be my question .,15,0.5,0.11236461251974106
0,0,"i mean , we so we have a we have a a system that works pretty well but it 's not , you know , the system that people here are used to using to working with .",15,0.5,0.15549887716770172
0,0,"well , i think what we wan na do is we want to eh ,",15,0.5,0.07927891612052917
0,0,so what what do we do now ?,15,0.5,0.07950786501169205
0,0,and we 've talked about this in other contexts we want to have the ability to feed it different features .,15,0.5,0.06754016131162643
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.13603466749191284
0,0,"and then , um , from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be s uh , substituting for htk .",15,0.5,0.11418025940656662
0,0,ok . ok .,15,0.5,0.07195058465003967
0,0,"i think that 's the key thing . and then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there .",15,0.5,0.11601144820451736
0,0,ok . alright .,15,0.5,0.10052282363176346
0,0,"and then , um , uh , also dave is is thinking about using the data in different ways , uh , to um , uh , explicitly work on reverberation",15,0.5,0.11913347989320755
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10500752180814743
0,0,"starting with some techniques that some other people have found somewhat useful , and yeah .",15,0.5,0.11719614267349243
0,0,"ok . so so the key thing that 's missing here is basically the ability to feed , you know , other features i into the recognizer",15,0.5,0.07752537727355957
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.15341968834400177
0,0,and also then to train the system .,15,0.5,0.11920791864395142
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.1006060466170311
0,0,"ok . and , uh , es i do n't know when chuck will be back but that 's exactly what he he 's gon na",15,0.5,0.18714861571788788
0,0,"h h he 's he 's sort of back , but he drove for fourteen hours an and was n't gon na make it in today .",15,0.5,0.17037568986415863
0,0,"oh , ok . so , i think that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on . um .",15,0.5,0.09858512133359909
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15229682624340057
0,0,just sort of t to make sure that we can do that,15,0.5,0.10597497224807739
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10662873834371567
0,0,and um .,15,0.5,0.11902989447116852
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.09787407517433167
0,0,"it 's uh , i mean , the the front - end is f i tha that 's in the sri recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly but it unfortunately is not designed and , um like the , uh , icsi system is , where you can feed it from a pipeline of of the command . so , the what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to , uh , dump out , um you know , if you want to use some new features , you have to dump them into individual files and give those files to the recognizer .",15,0.5,0.10137128829956055
0,0,we do we tend to do that anyway .,15,0.5,0.10421139746904373
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10484683513641357
0,0,"oh . so , although you you can pipe it as well , we tend to do it that way because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re - doing it over and over .",15,0.5,0.1100379228591919
0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.07082930952310562
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11816185712814331
0,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.08426254987716675
0,0,yeah . so i 've i,15,0.5,0.19910219311714172
0,0,so tha that 's exactly what the p - file is for .,15,0.5,0.1368592083454132
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14202575385570526
0,0,"yeah , the the the cumbersome thing is is , um is that you actually have to dump out little little files .",15,0.5,0.10774040967226028
0,0,uh,15,0.5,0.0850655660033226
0,0,so for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file .,15,0.5,0.20822791755199432
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.06886471807956696
0,0,"just like i th like th as if there were these waveform segments , but instead you have sort of feature file segments . but , you know so .",15,0.5,0.15825709700584412
0,0,cool . ok . so the s the the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments ?,15,0.5,0.10471491515636444
0,0,"oh . yes , we have i do n't know , did you wan na talk about it , or ? i can give a i was just telling this to jane and and w we we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring and um , some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition , which is a um , i think was both a a pruning problem and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations . and so we tried both of these st things . we tried saying i do n't know , i got this whacky idea that just from looking at the data , that when people talk their words are usually chunked together . it 's not that they say one word and then there 's a bunch of words together . they 're { comment } might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ? but in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average . so , um and then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too too severe .",15,0.5,0.16910149157047272
0,0,"so that 's actually interesting . the pruning was the same value that we used for recognition . and we had lowered that we had used tighter pruning after liz ran some experiments showing that , you know , it runs slower and there 's no real difference in",15,0.5,0.06005397439002991
0,0,actually it was better with slightly better or about th,15,0.5,0.06680531054735184
0,0,no gain .,15,0.5,0.15684136748313904
0,0,it was the same with tighter pruning .,15,0.5,0.16427649557590485
0,0,"right . so for free recognition , this the lower pruning value is better .",15,0.5,0.1388273537158966
0,0,it 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en at a point where it 's bad enough that that you do n't lose anything .,15,0.5,0.11647063493728638
0,0,"you correct . right . um , but it turned out for for to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly .",15,0.5,0.07937942445278168
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.06628356128931046
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.12398619204759598
0,0,"um because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment , um , in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker .",15,0.5,0.09495425224304199
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10511866211891174
0,0,"um , so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that , you know , as liz said the we f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous . it can not be you can not have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech . you can only have background speech at the beginning and the end .",15,0.5,0.14248499274253845
0,0,"yeah . i mean , yeah , it is n't always true , and i think what we really want is some clever way to do this , where , um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that things like words that do occur just by themselves a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it",15,0.5,0.14177751541137695
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08323534578084946
0,0,"those would be able to do that ,",15,0.5,0.11904681473970413
0,1,alright . we 're on .,15,0.5,0.11527011543512344
0,0,"test , um . test , test , test . guess that 's me . yeah . ok .",15,0.5,0.10060133039951324
0,0,"ooh , thursday .",15,0.5,0.10554797202348709
0,0,so . there 's two sheets of paper in front of us .,15,0.5,0.13721217215061188
0,0,what are these ?,15,0.5,0.09844865649938583
0,0,yeah . so .,15,0.5,0.0784614086151123
0,0,this is the arm wrestling ?,15,0.5,0.06851645559072495
0,0,"uh . yeah , we formed a coalition actually .",15,0.5,0.11956369131803513
0,0,yeah . almost .,15,0.5,0.11193493008613586
0,0,we already made it into one .,15,0.5,0.10460469126701355
0,0,"oh , good .",15,0.5,0.0823301449418068

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.1538362205028534

0,0,"it 's very simple , smoothing things .",15,0.5,0.12232773751020432
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09299241006374359

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1279360055923462
0,0,so it 's good because it 's difficult when we have to add noise to to to find the right level .,15,0.5,0.0957818329334259
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.10759270191192627
0,0,are you looking at one in in particular of these two ?,15,0.5,0.09321297705173492
0,0,yeah . so the sh it 's the sheet that gives fifty - f three point sixty - six .,15,0.5,0.07899484783411026
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09312649816274643
0,0,"um , the second sheet is abo uh , about the same . it 's the same , um , idea but it 's working on mel bands , and it 's a spectral subtraction instead of wiener filter , and there is also a noise addition after , uh , cleaning up the mel bins . mmm . well , the results are similar .",15,0.5,0.08456871658563614

0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.10365856438875198
0,0,"so , it probably does n't matter that much either way . but , um , when you say u uh , unified do you mean , uh , it 's one piece of software now , or ?",15,0.5,0.07947199791669846
0,0,"so now we are , yeah , setting up the software .",15,0.5,0.06247677654027939

0,0,so what 's what 's happened ? i think i 've missed something .,15,0.5,0.1252278834581375
0,0,ok . so a week ago maybe you were n't around when when when hynek and guenther and i ?,15,0.5,0.18602672219276428
0,0,hynek was here .,15,0.5,0.09147734940052032
0,0,yeah . i did n't .,15,0.5,0.11870937049388885

0,0,"we , uh we looked at , uh anyway we after coming back from qualcomm we had , you know , very strong feedback and , uh , i think it was hynek and guenter 's and my opinion also that , um , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression . but given the limited time , uh , it was sort of time to choose one .",15,0.5,0.17462396621704102
0,0,mm - hmm . mmm .,15,0.5,0.10812141746282578
0,0,"uh , and so , uh , th the vector taylor series had n't really worked out that much . uh , the subspace stuff , uh , had not been worked with so much . um , so it sort of came down to spectral subtraction versus wiener filtering .",15,0.5,0.074876569211483
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.11608514934778214

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.168840229511261
0,0,"and , uh , i mean , fundamentally they 're the same sort of thing but the math is a little different so that there 's a a there 's an exponent difference in the index you know , what 's the ideal filtering , and depending on how you construct the problem .",15,0.5,0.15005885064601898
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.08099445700645447
0,0,"and , uh , i guess it 's sort you know , after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me because um , if you 're dealing with power spectra then how are you gon na choose your error ? and typically you 'll do choose something like a variance . and so that means it 'll be something like the square of the power spectra . whereas when you 're when you 're doing the the , uh , um , looking at it the other way , you 're gon na be dealing with signals",15,0.5,0.15406332910060883

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09800609946250916
0,0,"but there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of of , uh , uh , over - subtraction and and and and and so forth , um , that arguably , you 're c and and and the choice of do you do you operate on the mel bands or do you operate on the fft beforehand . there 're so many other choices to make that are are almost well , if not independent , certainly in addition to the choice of whether you , uh , do spectral subtraction or wiener filtering , that , um , @ @ again we sort of felt the gang should just sort of figure out which it is they wan na do and then let 's pick it , go forward with it . so that 's that was that was last week . and and , uh , we said , uh , take a week , go arm wrestle , you know ,",15,0.5,0.1197587102651596

0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.11256499588489532
0,0,"and and so they so instead they went to yosemite and bonded , and and they came out with a single single piece of software . so it 's another another victory for international collaboration . so .",15,0.5,0.06985735148191452
0,0,so so you guys have combined or you 're going to be combining the software ?,15,0.5,0.04643804207444191
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.09068029373884201
0,0,"well , the piece of software has , like , plenty of options ,",15,0.5,0.1046876609325409
0,0,oh boy .,15,0.5,0.09184112399816513
0,0,"like you can parse command - line arguments . so depending on that , it it becomes either spectral subtraction or wiener filtering .",15,0.5,0.06562905013561249

0,0,they 're close enough .,15,0.5,0.09667474776506424

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09735392779111862
0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.1111263632774353
0,0,compared to the last evaluation numbers ? yeah .,15,0.5,0.12140235304832458

0,0,mm - hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.15182994306087494

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.17752139270305634
0,0,"and , uh , and it it is , uh , very close in performance to the best thing that was there before . uh , but , you know , looking at it another way , maybe more importantly , uh , we did n't have any explicit noise , uh , handling stationary dealing with e e we did n't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise .",15,0.5,0.07965435832738876

0,0,"well , so so so argu arguably , i mean , what we should do i mean , i gather you have it sounds like you have a few more days of of nailing things down with the software and so on . but and then but , um , arguably what we should do is , even though the software can do many things , we should for now pick a set of things , th these things i would guess , and not change that .",15,0.5,0.14882899820804596

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13832221925258636
0,0,and then i sent a note to sunil about the cuz he has been running some other systems,15,0.5,0.1186520904302597

0,0,oh yeah .,15,0.5,0.17072317004203796
0,0,"so um , i wan wan na wan na see what that is . but , uh , you know , so we 'll see what it is comparatively later . but it looks like , um",15,0.5,0.12341242283582687
0,0,m yeah .,15,0.5,0.15216009318828583
0,0,"you know most of the time , even i mean even though it 's true that the overall number for danish we did n't improve it if you look at it individually , what it really says is that there 's , um , uh looks like out of the six cases , between the different kinds of , uh , matching conditions out of the six cases , there 's basically , um , a couple where it stays about the same , uh , three where it gets better , and one where it gets worse .",15,0.5,0.0943370908498764

0,0,"y actually , uh , um , for the danish , there 's still some kind of mystery because , um , um , when we use the straight features , we are not able to get these nice number with the icsi ogi one , i mean . we do n't have this ninety - three seventy - eight , we have eight",15,0.5,0.12491321563720703

0,0,"we have a day or so , so when when when do you folks leave ?",15,0.5,0.09022632986307144
0,0,"uh , sunday .",15,0.5,0.08102719485759735

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.0861089900135994

0,0,mmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.11451270431280136
0,0,"good , ok . so , um so , we 'll we 'll hold off on that a little bit . i mean , even with these results as they are , it 's it 's it 's really not that bad . but but , uh , um and it looks like the overall result as they are now , even without , you know , any any bugs being fixed is that , uh , on the the other tasks , we had this average of , uh , forty uh nine percent , or so , improvement . and here we have somewhat better than that than the danish , and somewhat worse than that on the german , but i mean , it sounds like , uh , one way or another , the methods that we 're doing can reduce the error rate from from mel ceptrum down by , you know a fourth of them to , uh , a half of them . somewhere in there , depending on the exact case . so so that 's good . i mean , i think that , uh , one of the things that hynek was talking about was understanding what was in the other really good proposals and and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some , uh , combination of things . um , if , uh cuz there 's things that they are doing there that we certainly are not doing . and there 's things that we 're doing that they 're not doing . and and they all seem like good things .",15,0.5,0.11230352520942688

0,0,"mmm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.1316957175731659

0,0,"oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.14431561529636383
0,0,"so , i think in this community that 's of interest . it 's not like everything is being pinned on the evaluation set . but , um , for the development set , our best result was a little bit short of fifty percent . and the best result of any system was about fifty - four , where these numbers are the , uh , relative , uh , reduction in , uh , word error rate .",15,0.5,0.09619792550802231

0,0,"oh , wow .",15,0.5,0.10890661925077438

0,0,"yeah , actually , something that 's close to cepstral mean subtraction . but , uh , the way the mean is adapted um , it 's signal dependent . i 'm i 'm , uh so , basically , the mean is adapted during speech and not during silence .",15,0.5,0.09850437194108963
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10208699107170105
0,0,but it 's very close to to cepstral mean subtraction .,15,0.5,0.11091840267181396
0,0,"but some people have done exactly that sort of thing , of of and the i mean it 's not to to look in speech only , to try to m to measure these things during speech ,",15,0.5,0.16174735128879547
0,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.11867359280586243
0,0,"that 's p that 's not that uncommon . but i it it so it looks like they did some some , uh , reasonable things , uh , and they 're not things that we did , precisely . we did unreasonable things , which because we like to try strange things , and and , uh , and our things worked too .",15,0.5,0.10777121782302856
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.13928109407424927
0,0,"and so , um , uh , it 's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do . but the only caveat to that is that everybody 's being real conscious of how much memory and how much cpu they 're using",15,0.5,0.09426818042993546
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.16294041275978088
0,0,"because these , uh , standards are supposed to go on cell phones with m moderate resources in both respects .",15,0.5,0.1320963352918625
0,0,"did anybody , uh , do anything with the models as a an experiment ? or",15,0.5,0.10626274347305298
0,0,"uh , they did n't report it , if they did .",15,0.5,0.08375992625951767
0,0,n nobody reported it ?,15,0.5,0.08049305528402328
0,0,"yeah . i think everybody was focused elsewhere . um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a a , uh a filtering , which leads to a a , uh a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample . so , uh , as a result of that we have a reduced , um , transmission rate for the bits .",15,0.5,0.05336028337478638
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1453227549791336
0,0,"that was misreported the first time out . it it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested , uh , they were repeating the packets . so it was they were s they they had twenty - four hundred bits per second , but they were literally creating forty - eight hundred bits per second , um , even though y it was just repeated .",15,0.5,0.08628873527050018
0,0,oh . mm - hmm . right .,15,0.5,0.15910322964191437
0,0,"so , uh , in practice",15,0.5,0.17368465662002563
0,0,so you could 've had a repeat count in there or something .,15,0.5,0.19601544737815857
0,0,"well , n i mean , this was just a ph phoney thing just to to fit into the the software that was testing the errors channel errors and so on .",15,0.5,0.09998121112585068
0,0,oh . oh .,15,0.5,0.07366969436407089
0,0,"so so in reality , if you put this this system in into , uh , the field , it would be twenty - four hundred bits per second , not forty - eight hundred . so , um , so that 's a nice feature of what what we did . um , but , um , well , we still have to see how it all comes out .",15,0.5,0.05012752115726471
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.15941710770130157
0,0,"um , and then there 's the whole standards process , which is another thing altogether .",15,0.5,0.18104155361652374
0,1,"um , we have asr results from liz , transcript status from jane , and disk space and storage formats from don . does do we have any prefer preference on which way we wan na we wan na go ?",15,0.5,0.1673501580953598
0,0,"well i was actually gon na skip the asr results part , in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about",15,0.5,0.07427714765071869
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1817457228899002
0,0,"since i think that 's more important to moving forward , but i mean morgan has this paper copy and if people have questions , um , it 's pretty preliminary in terms of asr results because we did n't do anything fancy , but i think e just having the results there , and pointing out some main conclusions like it 's not the speaking style that differs , it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors . and then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors , which you would expect but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth , um , leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some kind of uh , echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close - talking mikes .",15,0.5,0.12449954450130463
0,0,so these,15,0.5,0.13683858513832092
0,0,"um , why do n't you , if you have a hard copy , why do n't you email it to the list .",15,0.5,0.1130552589893341
0,0,"so , that 's about the summary but this is morgan has this paper .",15,0.5,0.07302136719226837
0,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.22370117902755737
0,0,oh it 's in the paper .,15,0.5,0.1315624713897705
0,0,"yeah , so it 's the same thing ?",15,0.5,0.17952141165733337
0,0,i mean he he,15,0.5,0.10733287781476974
0,0,"it 's the same thing i mailed to every everybody that w where it was ,",15,0.5,0.1394578069448471
0,0,it it 's that paper .,15,0.5,0.1030101329088211
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12588348984718323
0,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.10715227574110031
0,0,"ok then , it 's already been mailed .",15,0.5,0.0976472944021225
0,0,"so , we basically , um , did a lot of work on that",15,0.5,0.07731298357248306
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.16428588330745697
0,0,"and it 's let 's see , th i guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad .",15,0.5,0.1132793053984642
0,0,horrible ?,15,0.5,0.16060782968997955
0,0,and it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech .,15,0.5,0.16249844431877136
0,0,"so , your your asr results were run on the channels synchronized ,",15,0.5,0.09846783429384232
0,0,"yes , cuz that 's all that w had been transcribed at the time ,",15,0.5,0.17498643696308136
0,0,ok . ok . ok .,15,0.5,0.11950921267271042
0,0,um but as we i mean i wanted to here more about the transcription . if we can get the channel asynchronous or the,15,0.5,0.08616770058870316
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.12178172916173935
0,0,the closer t that would be very interesting for us,15,0.5,0.10483503341674805
0,0,so if,15,0.5,0.0958082526922226
0,0,because we,15,0.5,0.10614939779043198
0,0,"yeah , that 's that 's why i only used the part from use",15,0.5,0.09493956714868546
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10921809077262878
0,0,which we had uh about uh about the alt over all the channels,15,0.5,0.08459430187940598
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1490514725446701
0,0,right . that 's,15,0.5,0.08257347345352173
0,0,yeah sure . yeah .,15,0.5,0.10007545351982117
0,0,or mixed channel,15,0.5,0.0904802680015564
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1933576911687851
0,0,rather mixed signal .,15,0.5,0.1096586287021637
0,0,so if there was a segment of speech this long,15,0.5,0.20585831999778748
0,0,cuz,15,0.5,0.10031022876501083
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11596939712762833
0,0,"and oh and someone said `` oh , `` the whole thing was passed to the recognizer ?",15,0.5,0.13278399407863617
0,0,and someone said `` oh `` in the front in the middle .,15,0.5,0.16500763595104218
0,0,"there were several speakers in it , yeah .",15,0.5,0.11244775354862213
0,0,that 's right . in fact i i pulled out a couple classic examples in case you wan na u use them in your talk of,15,0.5,0.14704833924770355
0,0,that 's why there 's so many insertion errors ?,15,0.5,0.09079001843929291
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.10904709249734879
0,0,"chuck on the lapel , so chuck wore the lapel three out of four times .",15,0.5,0.16666856408119202
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.14994235336780548
0,0,i noticed that chuck was wearing the lapel a lot .,15,0.5,0.12003356218338013
0,0,"early on , yeah .",15,0.5,0.1295526921749115
0,0,"um , yeah , and i wore the lapel once , and for me the lapel was ok . i mean i still and i do n't know why . i 'm but um ,",15,0.5,0.12615527212619781
0,0,probably how you wear it wore it i would guess .,15,0.5,0.09891766309738159
0,0,for you it was or who was next to me or something like that .,15,0.5,0.077492855489254
0,0,"yeah , where you were sitting probably affected it .",15,0.5,0.10038766264915466
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1591023951768875
0,0,"right , but when chuck wore the lapel and morgan was talking there 're a couple really long utterances where chuck is saying a few things inside , and it 's picking up all of morgan 's words pretty well and so the rec you know , there 're error rates because of insertion insertions are n't bounded , so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate .",15,0.5,0.16297660768032074
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.06612684577703476
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.2604091167449951
0,0,"and that 's that 's where the problems come in . so i this is sort of what we expected , but it 's nice to be able to to show it .",15,0.5,0.11542538553476334
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.1076345220208168
0,0,"and also i just wanted to mention briefly that , um , uh andreas and i called up dan ellis who 's still stuck in switzerland , and we were gon na ask him if if there 're you know , what 's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that . not that we were gon na do it , but we wanted to know what would need to be done .",15,0.5,0.12813837826251984
0,0,"and he said , `` lots lots lots lots . ``",15,0.5,0.15037105977535248
0,0,"and he we 've given him the data we have so far , so these sychronous cases where there are overlap .",15,0.5,0.14550116658210754
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.08070254325866699
0,0,and he 's gon na look into trying to run some things that are out there and see how well it can do,15,0.5,0.20141460001468658
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.14507247507572174
0,0,"because right now we 're not able to actually report on recognition in a real paper , like a eurospeech paper , because it would look sort of premature .",15,0.5,0.11760743707418442
0,0,"so so the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody 's only speaking a small amount in it , and then try to figure out where they 're speaking { comment } based on the other peopl",15,0.5,0.13196028769016266
0,0,"right . or who 's at any point in time who 's the foreground speaker , who 's the background speaker .",15,0.5,0.07193952053785324
0,0,so yeah,15,0.5,0.13910821080207825
0,0,i thought we were just gon na move the boundaries in .,15,0.5,0.10218150913715363
0,0,"yeah , should it",15,0.5,0.08915144205093384
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.1333896517753601
0,0,well that 's with the hand stuff .,15,0.5,0.1262340098619461
0,0,so there 's like,15,0.5,0.09559045732021332
0,0,but how would you do that automatically ?,15,0.5,0.0952494665980339
0,0,well ther there 's,15,0.5,0.07074588537216187
0,0,"uh , i 've actually done some experiments with cross - correlation",15,0.5,0.06952397525310516
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.13946408033370972
0,0,"and it seems to work pretty well to to get rid of those those overlaps ,",15,0.5,0.17745205760002136
0,0,i mean that that 's the sort of thing that you would do .,15,0.5,0.09109126031398773
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08006272464990616
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10150093585252762
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11076456308364868
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.10405654460191727
0,0,"yeah . exactly , so it 's it 's a",15,0.5,0.11109720915555954
0,0,so why do you want to do echo cancellation ?,15,0.5,0.07862181216478348
0,0,"um , it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation which i do n't know enough about to talk about .",15,0.5,0.11791668832302094
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.1069009006023407
0,0,it just it just to r to remove cross - talk .,15,0.5,0.20988279581069946
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.12386076152324677
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10229907184839249
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.13974058628082275
0,0,"but , right , um , and that would be similar to what you 're also trying to do , but using um , you know , more than energy",15,0.5,0.13070903718471527
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10341396182775497
0,0,i i do n't know what exactly would go into it .,15,0.5,0.10930190235376358
0,0,"yeah , sure .",15,0.5,0.1171349585056305
0,0,so it would be,15,0.5,0.11315560340881348
0,0,"so the idea is to basically run this on the whole meeting . and get the locations , which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual speak",15,0.5,0.12990248203277588
0,0,ok . so do sort of what he 's already what he 's trying to do .,15,0.5,0.11405248939990997
0,0,"right . except that there are many techniques for the kinds of cues , um , that you can use to do that .",15,0.5,0.09052125364542007
0,0,"yeah , in another way ,",15,0.5,0.1281634271144867
0,0,"ok , i s i see .",15,0.5,0.08293890953063965
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.09198106825351715
0,0,yeah . i see .,15,0.5,0.12594033777713776
0,0,"yeah , dave dave uh is , um , also gon na be doin usin playing around with echo cancellation for the nearfield farfield stuff ,",15,0.5,0.10123232007026672
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.12057960033416748
0,0,so we 'll be,15,0.5,0.08480259776115417
0,0,and i guess espen ? this is uh is he here too ?,15,0.5,0.05932221934199333
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.16330179572105408
0,0,"may also be working so it would just be ver that 's really the next step because we ca n't do too much , you know , on term in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem",15,0.5,0.10816220939159393
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.20419642329216003
0,0,"um , until we can do that kind of processing . and so , once we have some some of yours ,",15,0.5,0.13553188741207123
0,0,ok . yeah i 'm working on it .,15,0.5,0.12680286169052124
0,0,and @ @ we 'll move on .,15,0.5,0.13372917473316193
0,0,i think this also ties into one of the things that jane is gon na talk about too .,15,0.5,0.14128540456295013
0,0,"um ,",15,0.5,0.11193421483039856
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.13214798271656036
0,0,"i also wanted to say i have done all this chopping up of digits ,",15,0.5,0.10782381147146225
0,0,mm - hmm . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1211191862821579
0,0,"so i have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on . so let 's do that off - line ,",15,0.5,0.10770243406295776
0,0,oh right .,15,0.5,0.12579862773418427
0,0,we do n't need to do it during the meeting .,15,0.5,0.1027003675699234

0,0,right . definitely,15,0.5,0.11981165409088135
0,0,and and i have scripts that will extract it out from `` key `` files,15,0.5,0.1091235801577568
0,0,"uh , and don should",15,0.5,0.08291997760534286
0,0,"and and do all the naming automatically ,",15,0.5,0.11684060841798782
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.11791989207267761
0,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.1128164753317833
0,0,so you do n't have to do it by hand .,15,0.5,0.19287879765033722
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.10227005928754807
0,0,"you 've compiled the list of , uh , speaker names ?",15,0.5,0.09682637453079224
0,0,so that that 's it for the,15,0.5,0.08106344938278198
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1081339493393898
0,0,speakers and ok .,15,0.5,0.11076785624027252

0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.1257561296224594
0,0,and it does all sorts of matches because the way people filled out names is different on every single file so it does a very fuzzy sort of match .,15,0.5,0.09039193391799927
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08138200640678406
0,0,cool .,15,0.5,0.11298719048500061
0,0,"so at this point we can sort of finalize the naming , and so forth ,",15,0.5,0.0922715812921524
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.12857970595359802
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.1251637488603592
0,0,and we 're gon na basically re rewrite out these waveforms that we did because as you notice in the paper your `` m o in one meeting and `` m o - two `` in another meeting and it 's we just need to standardize the,15,0.5,0.17530225217342377
0,0,yeah . that was my fault .,15,0.5,0.11102858185768127
0,0,"um , no it 's it 's",15,0.5,0.10606639832258224
0,0,"no , i did n't notice that actually .",15,0.5,0.12205523252487183
0,0,"um , that 's why those comments are s are in there .",15,0.5,0.09745115786790848
0,0,yeah . then disregard it then .,15,0.5,0.1179981604218483
0,0,"yep . so th i now have a script that you can just say basically look up morgan ,",15,0.5,0.10953997075557709
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.1247585341334343

0,0,"um , i had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms and i do n't know exactly who to ask . i thought that maybe you would be the the person to talk to . so , is it a lossless compression { comment } when you compress ,",15,0.5,0.10389574617147446
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1257506161928177
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.1108909323811531
0,0,entropy coding .,15,0.5,0.09574238955974579
0,0,it just uses entropy coding ?,15,0.5,0.09590081125497818
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.10999847948551178
0,0,"ok . so , i mean , i guess my question would be is i just got this new eighteen gig drive installed . um , yeah , which is",15,0.5,0.09843210875988007
0,0,and i assume half of it is scratch and half of it is ?,15,0.5,0.19558177888393402
0,0,i 'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it .,15,0.5,0.0712466910481453
0,0,"probably , yeah .",15,0.5,0.1020437628030777
0,0,"but um ,",15,0.5,0.1190309226512909
0,0,"that 's typical , huh .",15,0.5,0.07725740224123001
0,0,"yeah , i do n't know what 's typical here , but um , it 's local though , so",15,0.5,0.1693129688501358
0,0,that does n't matter .,15,0.5,0.10635772347450256
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.07291408628225327
0,0,you can access it from anywhere in icsi . n,15,0.5,0.07354597002267838
0,0,ok . alright . how do you do that ?,15,0.5,0.1445937156677246
0,0,"in fact , this is an eighteen gig drive , { comment } or is it a thirty six gig drive with eighteen",15,0.5,0.07795056700706482

0,0,"slash n slash machine name , slash x a in all likelihood .",15,0.5,0.11561280488967896
0,0,oh ok .,15,0.5,0.1285248100757599
0,0,"oh i see . ok . alright , i did know that .",15,0.5,0.13399703800678253
0,0,"um , so the the only question is how much of it the distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not .",15,0.5,0.08167897164821625
0,0,mm - hmm . right .,15,0.5,0.16081777215003967
0,0,so what you wan na do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate .,15,0.5,0.14658838510513306
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.14509813487529755
0,0,"so , the stuff that is n't backed up is not a big deal because disks do n't crash very frequently ,",15,0.5,0.10569082945585251
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.07781239598989487
0,0,as long as you can regenerate it .,15,0.5,0.13791896402835846
0,0,"right . i mean all of this stuff can be regenerated ,",15,0.5,0.10814294219017029
0,0,yeah it 's,15,0.5,0.13868506252765656
0,0,it 's just a question,15,0.5,0.11353863030672073
0,0,then put it all on scratch,15,0.5,0.1495937556028366
0,0,well the,15,0.5,0.1372031271457672
0,0,because we 're icsi is is bottlenecked by backup .,15,0.5,0.09812033921480179
0,0,"mm - hmm , very good point .",15,0.5,0.07278098165988922
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10613355785608292
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.09716445952653885
0,0,so we wan na put,15,0.5,0.13911072909832
0,0,"well i 'd leave all the all the transcript stuff should n't should be backed up ,",15,0.5,0.10245761275291443
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09858498722314835
0,0,"but all the waveform { comment } sound files should not be backed up ,",15,0.5,0.1036551371216774
0,0,"yeah , i guess right .",15,0.5,0.05068357661366463
0,0,the ones that you write out .,15,0.5,0.10918285697698593
0,0,"ok . so , i mean , i guess th the other question was then , should we shorten them , downsample them , or keep them in their original form ? um",15,0.5,0.11834895610809326
0,0,"it just depends on your tools . i mean , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools ca n't take shortened format , i would leave them expanded ,",15,0.5,0.12028709053993225
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.13039806485176086
0,0,so you do n't have to unshorten them every single time you wan na do anything .,15,0.5,0.11820730566978455
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.06754433363676071
0,0,"we can downsample them ,",15,0.5,0.09766580164432526
0,0,do you think that 'd be ok ?,15,0.5,0.09561675786972046
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.0958012193441391
0,0,to downsample them ?,15,0.5,0.08625327050685883
0,0,"yeah . yeah , we get the same performance .",15,0.5,0.10398275405168533
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1110464408993721
0,0,"i mean the r the front - end on the sri recognizer just downsamples them on the fly ,",15,0.5,0.10071121901273727
0,0,"yeah , i guess the only argument against downsampling is to preserve just the original files in case we want to experiment with different filtering techniques .",15,0.5,0.10419782251119614
0,0,so so that 's,15,0.5,0.07757491618394852
0,0,i i i 'm sorry,15,0.5,0.08162467181682587
0,0,"yeah , if",15,0.5,0.11737490445375443
0,0,"yeah , l i mean over all our data , we we want to not downsample .",15,0.5,0.125148743391037
0,0,fe you 'd you wan na not . ok .,15,0.5,0.0704134851694107
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1187766045331955
0,0,"so we 're what we 're doing is we 're writing out i mean , this is just a question . we 're writing out these individual segments , that wherever there 's a time boundary from thilo , or or jane 's transcribers , you know , we we chop it there .",15,0.5,0.09882606565952301
0,0,yeah . mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09895934909582138
0,0,"and the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer ,",15,0.5,0.14030544459819794
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.08165937662124634
0,0,and throw out ones that we 're not using and so forth .,15,0.5,0.07219727337360382
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10603189468383789
0,0,and those are the ones that we 're storing .,15,0.5,0.06786946952342987
0,0,"yeah , as i said , since that 's it 's regeneratable , what i would do is take downsample it ,",15,0.5,0.1360500305891037
0,0,so yeah .,15,0.5,0.14531166851520538
0,0,and compress it however you 're e the sri recognizer wants to take it in .,15,0.5,0.11695738136768341
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11187835782766342
0,0,ye,15,0.5,0.09855730831623077
0,0,"so we ca n't shorten them ,",15,0.5,0.09596885740756989
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08985327184200287
0,0,but we can downsample them .,15,0.5,0.09224233031272888
0,0,"yeah , i mean yeah , i 'm sorry .",15,0.5,0.10408317297697067
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.11764011532068253
0,0,"as yeah , as long as there is a a form that we can come from again , that is not downsampled , { comment } then ,",15,0.5,0.09084717929363251
0,0,r yeah .,15,0.5,0.07139292359352112
0,0,oh yeah th,15,0.5,0.0579364150762558
0,0,yeah those are gon na be kept .,15,0.5,0.12329600006341934
0,0,yeah . yeah . that that 's why we need more disk space,15,0.5,0.1454908549785614
0,0,uuu,15,0.5,0.1109418049454689
0,0,"cuz we 're basically duplicating the originals , um",15,0.5,0.10337688028812408
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.07640890032052994
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.1125752255320549
0,0,then it 's fine . but for for fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on,15,0.5,0.10775186121463776
0,0,oh yeah .,15,0.5,0.09376954287290573
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11135377734899521
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.07892171293497086
0,0,no . we always have the original long ones .,15,0.5,0.12121660262346268
0,0,we would like to,15,0.5,0.14173084497451782
0,0,so the sri front - end wo n't take a uh an an a large audio file name and then a a list of segments to chop out { comment } from that large audio file ?,15,0.5,0.10118798911571503
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09215037524700165
0,0,they actually have to be chopped out already ?,15,0.5,0.10524746775627136
0,0,"um , it 's better if they 're chopped out ,",15,0.5,0.11678439378738403
0,0,uh - huh .,15,0.5,0.11003605276346207
0,0,"and and it it will be yeah , y we could probably write something to do that , but it 's actually convenient to have them chopped out cuz you can run them , you know , in different orders . you c you can actually move them around .",15,0.5,0.20898942649364471
0,0,and that 's the whole point about the naming conventions,15,0.5,0.08680902421474457
0,0,"uh , you can get rid of",15,0.5,0.08945221453905106
0,0,"is that you could run all the english speaking ,",15,0.5,0.07231418043375015
0,0,"yeah , it it 's a lot faster .",15,0.5,0.13161548972129822
0,0,"all the native speakers , and all the non - native speakers ,",15,0.5,0.10890758037567139
0,0,"right . you can grab everything with the word `` the `` in it ,",15,0.5,0.11581962555646896
0,0,"and all the men , and all the women . yeah .",15,0.5,0.09231722354888916
0,0,"and it 's that 's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time , find the time boundaries and so in principle , yeah , you could do that ,",15,0.5,0.10212458670139313
0,0,i do n't i do n't think that 's really right .,15,0.5,0.09166654199361801
0,0,but it 's but it 's um,15,0.5,0.10172152519226074
0,0,"`` that 's just not right , man . `` the the point",15,0.5,0.09078197926282883
0,0,these are long these are long,15,0.5,0.09558428078889847
0,0,"so so s for example , what if you wanted to run run all the native speakers .",15,0.5,0.14269386231899261
0,0,you know . this is an hour of speech .,15,0.5,0.1598627120256424
0,0,"right , so if if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere , extracts out the language , finds the time - marks for that particular one , do it that way . the way they 're doing it , you have that already extracted and it 's embedded in the file name . and so , you know , you just say",15,0.5,0.1172977015376091
0,0,we - yeah that 's so that 's part of it,15,0.5,0.1584547758102417
0,0,"y so you just say you know `` asterisk e asterisk dot wave `` , and you get what you want .",15,0.5,0.09393710643053055
0,0,is right . and the other part is just that once they 're written out it it is a lot faster to to process them .,15,0.5,0.11385689675807953
0,0,rather than doing seeks through the file .,15,0.5,0.10596491396427155
0,0,"so . otherwise , you 're just accessing",15,0.5,0.07379963994026184
0,0,"this is all just temporary access , so i do n't i think it 's all just it 's fine . you know . fine to do it however is convenient .",15,0.5,0.07830502092838287
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.12719157338142395
0,0,i mean it just depends how big the file is . if the file sits in memory you can do extremely fast seeks,15,0.5,0.16839776933193207
0,0,"right . the other thing is that , believe it or not i mean , we have some",15,0.5,0.10574623197317123
0,0,but .,15,0.5,0.10957922786474228
0,0,yeah and they do n't . two gig ?,15,0.5,0.12065759301185608
0,0,so we 're also looking at these in waves like for the alignments and so forth . you ca n't load an hour of speech into x waves .,15,0.5,0.11951569467782974
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09387210756540298
0,0,"you need to s have these small files , and in fact , even for the transcriber program um",15,0.5,0.09714175760746002
0,0,yes you can .,15,0.5,0.12701818346977234
0,0,"yeah , you you can give waves a start and an end time . and middle .",15,0.5,0.11148704588413239
0,0,"yeah , if you try to load s really long waveform into x waves , you 'll be waiting there for",15,0.5,0.10450077056884766
0,1,"and we already got the crash out of the way . it did crash , so i feel much better , earlier .",15,0.5,0.12537109851837158
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.11086113005876541
0,0,interesting . hmm .,15,0.5,0.140497624874115
0,0,"will you get the door , and ?",15,0.5,0.13061794638633728
0,0,"ok , so um .",15,0.5,0.12710416316986084
0,0,"ok . you collected an agenda , huh ?",15,0.5,0.08423392474651337
0,0,i did collect an agenda . so i 'm gon na go first . mwa - ha - ha ! it should n't take too long .,15,0.5,0.15080417692661285
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15185433626174927
0,0,"um , so we 're pretty much out of digits . we 've gone once through the set . um , so the only thing i have to do",15,0.5,0.1324346363544464
0,0,no there 's only ten .,15,0.5,0.10499785095453262

0,0,to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have .,15,0.5,0.1408521831035614
0,0,right . well that 's fine with me as long as it 's just that i did n't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits .,15,0.5,0.15897691249847412

0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.11706716567277908

0,0,mm - hmm . are the patterns like are they based on anything or,15,0.5,0.12888117134571075
0,0,"um , i i just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there , and they 're usually grouped into either two , three , or four , four digits at a time .",15,0.5,0.15754391252994537
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.10005930811166763
0,0,"and they can have , i mean , actually , things are getting longer and longer . in the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth . so , there 's between , um well if you look at it , there are between like three and five groups , and each one has between two and four groupings and i purposely did n't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern .",15,0.5,0.11721915751695633
0,0,mmm .,15,0.5,0.11628910899162292
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.12413278967142105
0,0,"and which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly .",15,0.5,0.10884472727775574
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.1249263733625412
0,0,"so unlike the previous one , which i d simply replicated ti - digits , this is generated randomly .",15,0.5,0.15323491394519806
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.07368236035108566

0,0,"mmm , oh , ok .",15,0.5,0.1479267030954361
0,0,"but i think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits , whether it 's these digits or ti - digits , to speakers , um , and compare that to their spontaneous speech , and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data because you might be wearing a different microphone",15,0.5,0.10043714195489883
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14242030680179596
0,0,"and , i mean so it 's it 's nice to have the digits you know , replicated many times . especially for speakers that do n't talk a lot .",15,0.5,0.08508652448654175
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09772127866744995
0,0,"so um , for adaptation . no , i 'm serious ,",15,0.5,0.08432960510253906
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14148764312267303
0,0,yeah all we have for some people is digits .,15,0.5,0.14239995181560516
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08907405287027359
0,0,"so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation , and we 're not using the digit data now , but you know",15,0.5,0.10750792920589447
0,0,"oh , you 're not .",15,0.5,0.09047462791204453
0,0,"not for adaptation , nope . v w we 're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on and i 'd as soon as someone started to read transcript number , that 's read speech and i thought `` well , we 're gon na do better on that ,",15,0.5,0.11548065394163132
0,0,oh i see .,15,0.5,0.12418854236602783
0,0,that 's not fair to use `` .,15,0.5,0.06481240689754486
0,0,"oh yeah that 's true , absolutely .",15,0.5,0.09762120246887207
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.11968427896499634
0,0,"but , it might be fair to use the data for adaptation , so . so those speakers who are very quiet , { comment } shy",15,0.5,0.09913059324026108
0,0,that would be interesting to see whether that helps .,15,0.5,0.08301389962434769
0,0,r right,15,0.5,0.10332382470369339
0,0,like adam ?,15,0.5,0.06286906450986862
0,0,"do you think that would help adapting on yeah . yeah , i have a real problem with that .",15,0.5,0.13847507536411285
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.15893323719501495
0,0,"well , it sh i mean it 's the same micropho see the nice thing is we have that in the in the same meeting ,",15,0.5,0.1847413033246994
0,0,"right . same same acoustics ,",15,0.5,0.09508214890956879
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.1206798404455185

0,0,same channel .,15,0.5,0.13771189749240875
0,0,"right , and so i still like the idea of having some kind of digit data .",15,0.5,0.21148286759853363
0,0,ok . good .,15,0.5,0.11836576461791992
0,0,"yeah i mean , for the for the um acoustic research , for the signal - processing , farfield stuff , i see it as as as the place that we start . but , th i mean , it 'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data , but but uh the truth is i 'm hoping that we we through the the stuff that that you guys have been doing as you continue that , we get , uh , the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff uh , uh nearfield , and then um , we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield , and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield . so .",15,0.5,0.12305513024330139

0,0,"yeah , we talked about that a couple times .",15,0.5,0.1213047131896019

0,0,overlapping digits !,15,0.5,0.1774236410856247
0,0,the the problem i see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load .,15,0.5,0.16106121242046356

0,0,i think that,15,0.5,0.06655155122280121

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.0813041403889656
0,0,"oh , yeah . it 's a it 's working .",15,0.5,0.10597360879182816
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.11537987738847733
0,0,"alright . so what we had was that we were gon na talk about data collection , and , um , uh , you you put up there data format ,",15,0.5,0.1426948606967926
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.15283818542957306
0,0,"and other tasks during data collection ,",15,0.5,0.19318808615207672
0,0,"so , i think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get",15,0.5,0.08236979693174362
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.12628912925720215
0,0,"what can you add to it to get , um , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? like",15,0.5,0.09604426473379135
0,0,"uh , especially for querying .",15,0.5,0.0760791152715683
0,0,"especially for querying . so , getting people to do queries afterwards , getting people to do summaries afterwards . um .",15,0.5,0.22813400626182556
0,0,"well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , um , i uh , if he i , um if he has s i i do n't remember , mister lan - doctor landry ?",15,0.5,0.11713870614767075

0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11517085134983063
0,0,then that would sort of be a summary which you would n't have to solicit . y if if we were able to to do that .,15,0.5,0.15582849085330963
0,0,"well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . so action item or uh , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah .",15,0.5,0.08736267685890198
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.0830325335264206
0,0,so that would n't be a summary . that would just be that would b relate to the query side .,15,0.5,0.13502606749534607
0,0,"but if we had the crosspads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow ,",15,0.5,0.13704590499401093
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.11723386496305466
0,0,"right . i mean , we because you 'd have several people with these pads , you could collect different things .",15,0.5,0.15361885726451874
0,0,you know .,15,0.5,0.08536271005868912
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.11807025223970413
0,0,"i mean , cuz i tend to take notes which are summaries . and so , you know",15,0.5,0.19614219665527344
0,0,"i mean , the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , uh , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor .",15,0.5,0.12884898483753204
0,0,well,15,0.5,0.11153239011764526
0,0,but that 's alright . i do n't think there 'd be so many that you could n't have someone clean it up,15,0.5,0.08456440269947052
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.1344929039478302
0,0,pretty easily .,15,0.5,0.113287054002285
0,0,yeah . we also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things .,15,0.5,0.10969147086143494
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.08666163682937622
0,0,"and the other things , people can write whatever they want . i mean , it 's to some extent , uh , for his benefit . so , if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful .",15,0.5,0.08893650770187378

0,0,thanks .,15,0.5,0.11444111913442612
0,0,"yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the jimlets { comment } will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . you know , probably with double - sided tape , but so . you so we wo n't have to go through that .",15,0.5,0.10019443184137344
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.13018405437469482
0,0,"i have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say `` jimlet `` and the person listening wo n't know what that is , sh shou how how do we get is that important information ? you know , the jimlet i mean , the box that contains the",15,0.5,0.18229210376739502
0,0,"well , i mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . there 's gon na be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common { comment } that we will not know .",15,0.5,0.13580194115638733

0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.1507686823606491
0,0,so the there will be jargon that we he there 'll be transcription errors .,15,0.5,0.12741075456142426
0,0,good .,15,0.5,0.06597933173179626
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09668703377246857
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.12663541734218597
0,0,"i mean , we we were originally gon na do this with vlsi design , and and and the reason we did n't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . so .",15,0.5,0.11773894727230072
0,0,"well , that was just one of the reasons . but , yeah , definitely .",15,0.5,0.081617571413517
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.09405159950256348
0,0,ok . good .,15,0.5,0.09119740128517151
0,0,that that 's right . there were others of course . yeah .,15,0.5,0.12647616863250732
0,0,"ok , so we were on the data collection { comment } and the summary issue .",15,0.5,0.09818455576896667
0,0,right . we can go back .,15,0.5,0.09573487937450409
0,0,"so , uh , u u so , actually there 's kind of three issues . there 's the crosspad issue . should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ? um , do we have s people write summaries ? everybody or one person ? and then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? is that",15,0.5,0.10859964042901993
0,0,"there 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ?",15,0.5,0.08287011086940765
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.15130014717578888
0,0,"i mean , that was one thing i was thinking about was is that dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then .",15,0.5,0.14450694620609283
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.1815575510263443
0,0,"but there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not if you do n't have an interactive system , it 's gon na be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question .",15,0.5,0.12903980910778046
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08448339253664017
0,0,right . and furth id explore the data further .,15,0.5,0.11431591957807541
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.08424829691648483
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.09592311829328537
0,0,there 's there 's another problem,15,0.5,0.08903225511312485
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.1529821902513504
0,0,"which is , um , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , uh , uh , recording meetings about meeting recorder . and , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously . and if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group and and , uh , they were fine with it . but if we 'd said , `` ok , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , uh , the summar ``",15,0.5,0.15083326399326324
0,0,"well , i asked them to and none of them did .",15,0.5,0.07771378755569458
0,0,t see ? there we go .,15,0.5,0.09042304754257202
0,0,"so , i i asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting",15,0.5,0.0870363861322403
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.09604410827159882
0,0,they,15,0.5,0.0866754874587059
0,0,and no one ever did .,15,0.5,0.06095390394330025
0,0,mm - hmm .,15,0.5,0.14189979434013367
0,0,i did n't follow up either .,15,0.5,0.0960051566362381
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10576719045639038
0,0,"so i did n't track them down and say `` please do th do it now `` . but , uh , no one spontaneously provided anything .",15,0.5,0.09819216281175613
0,0,"i i 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random ,",15,0.5,0.0736352875828743
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.06718813627958298
0,0,"uh , as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gon na use this thing .",15,0.5,0.06782141327857971
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.12926419079303741
0,0,ok .,15,0.5,0.13541339337825775
0,0,"i just do n't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say `` that 's important , that might be a query `` .",15,0.5,0.1475410908460617
0,0,"tsk . well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , um , there are certain key words like , you know , `` action item `` and things like that , which could be used in , uh , t to some degree finding the structure .",15,0.5,0.08254735916852951
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.14073660969734192
0,0,although,15,0.5,0.12131521105766296
0,0,w,15,0.5,0.12025867402553558
0,0,"and and i also , um , was thinking , with reference to the n uh , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . and the fir third thing i wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , um , i think they should be recorded instead of written because i think that , um , it would take so long for people to write that i think you would n't get as good a summary .",15,0.5,0.24088679254055023
0,0,how about this idea ? that normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker .,15,0.5,0.1353466659784317
0,0,"yeah , good . good point .",15,0.5,0.08420974761247635
0,0,and so why do n't we just use the notes that somebody takes ?,15,0.5,0.10580414533615112
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.0933787003159523
0,0,"i mean , that gives you a summary but it does n't really how do you generate queries from that ?",15,0.5,0.14893002808094025
0,0,"well . but , i mean , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system .",15,0.5,0.09488482773303986
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.10259104520082474
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.13967609405517578
0,0,"right ? i mean , they 're something . it 's a a kind of output you 'd like .",15,0.5,0.1587575376033783
0,0,actually and so,15,0.5,0.15842024981975555
0,0,"uh , james and i were talking about this during one of the breaks . and the problem with that is , i 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what i 'm gon na do for my thesis .",15,0.5,0.11111252754926682
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.10542600601911545
0,0,"i 'm gon na do something . i 'm not gon na do anything with summarization . and so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gon na be me .",15,0.5,0.11137960106134415
