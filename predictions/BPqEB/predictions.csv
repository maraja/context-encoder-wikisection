0,0,"i 'll do the notes . yeah , thanks .",15,0.5,0.31583529710769653
1,0,"so um well i i figured uh we should um identify some user requirements , and from my experience , i wan na uh , and from research i did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you ca n't uh ca n't have like uh waffling on this point , you know .",15,0.5,0.7199357748031616
0,0,"really have it needs to be able y y have to be able to find it . because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . so uh , i also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those , and , as i said in the first meeting , um and then uh we might wan na talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product",15,0.5,0.4698329567909241
0,0,"so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth . i did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , so , i guess this guy zenith uh created the flashmatic , which i kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the t_v_ on and off , that might be interesting . and um so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so i think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later .",15,0.5,0.45325085520744324
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5076351165771484
0,0,"and uh it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was uh sensitive to the sun , so that uh it would get would start off by the you 'd get it would easily cause um problems . so , uh i in addition to uh looking at the um uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today which i think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind .",15,0.5,0.4437451958656311
1,0,fantastic .,15,0.5,0.5903828144073486
1,0,"it 'd be easy to find . and um it would uh y you 'd you could throw it at things if if the t_v_ did n't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . and since i 'm not really um industrial designer , i did n't really know what to do with this slide . but um i just took some different uh schematics and i put them into this , and i guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . i do n't know why um we were asked to do this . so , uh personal preferences , um",15,0.5,0.5275106430053711
1,0,"i think we could uh i i 'm really thinking outside the box here , and i think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference .",15,0.5,0.6276033520698547
0,0,"so something that 's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . i think um it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you did n't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user 's home . um i think uh it needs to be waterproof , because uh sometimes they fall into cups",15,0.5,0.3674195408821106
1,0,"and , you know , it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that . um if you uh mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it 's done its job or not , because half the time , i keep pushing on the remote control , and i do n't know if it 's actually understood my message , so i think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . and uh , course i never wan na replace the battery . so ,",15,0.5,0.7825456261634827

0,0,run over it with a car .,15,0.5,0.285514235496521
1,0,"yes . okay , so if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable , okay , i think that will give a lot of advantage for our product , if i 'm not wrong . maybe you can uh add it in that .",15,0.5,0.5285370349884033

1,0,"yeah , i think we 're i mean before we close the meeting , we 're supposed to come up with some ideas for",15,0.5,0.5451650619506836
1,0,oh k so we 're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or,15,0.5,0.5196124911308289
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5405792593955994
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5398173332214355
1,0,oh okay .,15,0.5,0.5726427435874939
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.39508286118507385
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5162402391433716
0,0,"i thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but",15,0.5,0.4652961790561676
1,0,"yeah , i think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe .",15,0.5,0.5446887016296387
0,0,"okay . right , who 's got experiences with remote controls then ? pretty much everybody .",15,0.5,0.49522697925567627
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.41598862409591675
1,0,"yeah , i think we 've all got",15,0.5,0.6070801019668579
1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.6260392069816589
1,0,um .,15,0.5,0.5284042358398438
0,0,is this a t_v_ one we are supposed to make ?,15,0.5,0.44948258996009827
1,0,yeah . yeah it 's a t_v_ remote control .,15,0.5,0.554672360420227
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4707685112953186
1,0,'kay um .,15,0.5,0.5227358937263489
1,0,well .,15,0.5,0.5987632870674133
0,0,t,15,0.5,0.35311707854270935
1,0,a new remote control for t_v_ . what would i like ? um .,15,0.5,0.7030843496322632
0,0,w what you want it big do you want it small . are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that 's that 's big and,15,0.5,0.3278684616088867
0,0,medium .,15,0.5,0.4766058325767517
1,0,"mm . yeah it seems like there 's like there 's sort of a tension between two ideas , i mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of t_v_ and if you have whatever associated with t_v_ the d_v_d_ player , or something like that ,",15,0.5,0.5755013227462769
0,0,video and ts hi-fi and stuff .,15,0.5,0.43101125955581665
1,0,but like at the same time you do n't wan na really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something .,15,0.5,0.5883040428161621
1,0,maybe you yeah,15,0.5,0.565607488155365
1,1,"okay . okay . okay , thanks . you want to go ?",15,0.5,0.5300425291061401
0,0,yep . so yeah .,15,0.5,0.2622099816799164
1,0,"so most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own i",15,0.5,0.7050984501838684
0,0,this one ?,15,0.5,0.36183321475982666
1,0,"yeah , it should be .",15,0.5,0.5289973616600037
1,0,"great . no , not that one . you are two .",15,0.5,0.5568674802780151
0,0,two .,15,0.5,0.4834586977958679
1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.6092694401741028
1,0,"okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . so he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . so the old kind of users who do n't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our marketing expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing .",15,0.5,0.5679671764373779
0,0,"okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .",15,0.5,0.49133238196372986
0,0,"that 's right . so anyway , that did n't come into my mind ,",15,0.5,0.3030221164226532
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.7187632322311401
0,0,so th that is a possibility . these could be other kind of interfaces .,15,0.5,0.46979668736457825
1,0,"means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . so spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . so if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is ,",15,0.5,0.545127809047699
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.436021625995636
1,0,"and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five euros money which we are thinking . otherwise we are just like others in the market . so anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which can not be done now actually . so apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . and for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .",15,0.5,0.5504074692726135
0,0,yeah . that increases the the cost also .,15,0.5,0.3726193904876709
1,0,uh that 's right . but uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that .,15,0.5,0.6293706297874451
0,0,do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ?,15,0.5,0.42543599009513855
0,0,"uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it 's enough .",15,0.5,0.3673761188983917
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.49749279022216797
1,0,"yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc",15,0.5,0.5422978401184082
1,0,well wh uh i imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones,15,0.5,0.5065246224403381
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3451486825942993
1,0,because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control .,15,0.5,0.7060918211936951
1,0,that 's right . no it it could be little d yeah it could be,15,0.5,0.5312219262123108
0,0,so it could be s a few centimetres .,15,0.5,0.3712715208530426
1,0,"well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though ,",15,0.5,0.7371814846992493
0,0,that 's right . that 's right .,15,0.5,0.38895684480667114
1,0,"because , i 'm not sure exactly where we 're gon na sell this , but i presume it 's not gon na just be english speaking countries .",15,0.5,0.5129473805427551
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6518210172653198
1,0,"so then you have to s you know , you have to train models for",15,0.5,0.5143101811408997
0,0,"mm-hmm mm-hmm . uh it 's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so d_t_w_ could be kind of which is the easiest . so you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and it 's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller .",15,0.5,0.49244630336761475
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5018338561058044
1,0,okay . okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide .,15,0.5,0.5543212890625
1,0,"yeah , that 's right . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5359418988227844
1,0,this is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion .,15,0.5,0.5776891112327576
0,0,so we can that 's right . yep .,15,0.5,0.474910169839859
1,0,"okay , next . uh that finished ?",15,0.5,0.5820140242576599
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4368588328361511
1,0,no ?,15,0.5,0.6133666038513184
0,0,no no . components .,15,0.5,0.4819544553756714
0,0,components ?,15,0.5,0.4216627776622772
1,0,"yeah . so , will you go to the next slide ?",15,0.5,0.5642842054367065
1,0,yes sure .,15,0.5,0.5668087601661682
0,0,"yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . we are having a power button and the switch , which is not much ,",15,0.5,0.42612794041633606
1,0,and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . and then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time .,15,0.5,0.6247679591178894
0,0,"so we could not put that . so now where the a_s_r_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . so there is a_s_r_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . and then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .",15,0.5,0.35963737964630127
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6749746799468994
1,0,so this is the easiest design the there could be . so th an a_s_r_ decoder we can have things in . to have different technologies . so this was the my personal preference was that we can have a_s_r_ sitting there on the remote control .,15,0.5,0.5101073980331421
0,0,"you know i guess you could actually train the remote control as you 're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button",15,0.5,0.37380361557006836
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5136779546737671
1,0,"like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing",15,0.5,0.6544830799102783
0,0,yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up .,15,0.5,0.4123644530773163
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4815334379673004
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6319599151611328
1,0,so these are the slight problems .,15,0.5,0.6426224112510681
1,0,so your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?,15,0.5,0.5790273547172546
0,0,"because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though i do n't have much idea , but as he the uh marketing expert presentation was",15,0.5,0.3786807358264923
1,0,i 'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will s will buy it .,15,0.5,0.5832704901695251
0,0,actually i 'm not so sure,15,0.5,0.3655160069465637
1,0,so if we go with just the,15,0.5,0.5255195498466492
1,0,because i 'm the,15,0.5,0.5017511248588562
0,0,i 'm sure .,15,0.5,0.4431895911693573
1,0,"you know if i was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because i ca n't hear it very well , i do n't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when i 'm when i 'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control . you know if there 's some there 's some dialogue all of a sudden that i ca n't hear , i 'm trying to actually find out what 's being said ,",15,0.5,0.6044964790344238
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.34426552057266235
1,0,so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .,15,0.5,0.5895417332649231
0,0,okay so,15,0.5,0.4618189036846161
0,0,"yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it 's about",15,0.5,0.40299057960510254
1,0,well it depends if it 's a remote control th,15,0.5,0.6781505346298218
0,0,"it 's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that .",15,0.5,0.28732770681381226
1,0,"maybe if the remote control is something that y you do n't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion .",15,0.5,0.7376860976219177
0,0,"if you can leave it sitting on the table and you do n't actually have to find it , then that could be .",15,0.5,0.3551165759563446
1,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.572939395904541
1,0,"okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now .",15,0.5,0.5590065717697144
1,1,"okay we all all set ? right . well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . um we 're gon na discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we 're gon na evaluate the product . and the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , um and then i 'm gon na have to specify the final design in the final report . so um just from from last time to recap , we said we were gon na have a snowman shaped remote control with no l_c_d_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gon na be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . anything i 've missed ?",15,0.5,0.5002279877662659
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5973940491676331
1,0,okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead .,15,0.5,0.5096001625061035
0,0,uh-oh . this is it ?,15,0.5,0.4670700430870056
1,0,"ninja homer , made in japan .",15,0.5,0.665946900844574
0,0,"um , there are a few changes we 've made .",15,0.5,0.4257675111293793
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4029286503791809
1,0,"um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside ,",15,0.5,0.5951895713806152
0,0,mm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3069179356098175
0,0,"so instead we 've um this is gon na be an l_c_d_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button .",15,0.5,0.46834319829940796
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.3591660261154175
1,0,"uh , apart from that , it 's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .",15,0.5,0.7249085307121277
0,0,"and there is n't uh d it does n't open up to the advanced functions ? the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they 're hidden in the sense that um they 're not in use .",15,0.5,0.48446083068847656
0,0,where are they ?,15,0.5,0.48155996203422546
1,0,um they 're in the l_c_d_ panel and the jog-dial ?,15,0.5,0.5272701382637024
1,0,"ah , right .",15,0.5,0.5269880294799805
0,0,okay 'cause,15,0.5,0.4370443820953369
1,0,so w what kind of thing uh is gon na be,15,0.5,0.6346050500869751
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.44399088621139526
0,0,"the l_c_d_ panel just displays um functionally what you 're doing . if you 're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say",15,0.5,0.31918326020240784
1,0,right . okay .,15,0.5,0.5161961317062378
1,0,"you know it 's like it only has four columns , it 's a very simple l_c_d_ like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast .",15,0.5,0.5273596048355103
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.4726208448410034
1,0,mm-hmm . okay cool .,15,0.5,0.572679877281189
1,0,"right , 'kay .",15,0.5,0.5562887787818909
0,0,"it might even be one , a bit more complex l_c_d_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .",15,0.5,0.4414314329624176
1,0,okay,15,0.5,0.5673025250434875
1,0,oh right okay .,15,0.5,0.5447733402252197
1,0,"mm-hmm , and what is this here ?",15,0.5,0.510127604007721
1,0,cool .,15,0.5,0.515898585319519
0,0,that 's a number pad .,15,0.5,0.4969691038131714
1,0,"okay so the number pad is 'kay , great .",15,0.5,0.6123197078704834
1,0,where are we gon na have the slogan ?,15,0.5,0.5627768635749817
1,0,um they 're al along this,15,0.5,0.5381987690925598
1,0,"you know , just like right inside there .",15,0.5,0.5255945324897766
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5562840104103088
1,0,okay cool .,15,0.5,0.5240921974182129
1,0,"you have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom .",15,0.5,0.588056743144989
0,0,"'cause slogans are usually quite small , right ,",15,0.5,0.41048920154571533
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5480310916900635
1,0,they 're not like huge,15,0.5,0.5394050478935242
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4126879572868347
1,0,so they 're s,15,0.5,0.6003878116607666
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.43105998635292053
0,0,say a button 's about,15,0.5,0.45499786734580994
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6926965713500977
1,0,looks good .,15,0.5,0.5034602284431458
0,0,"say a button 's about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that .",15,0.5,0.3284769356250763
1,0,yep . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5429724454879761
1,0,"so if this is n't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ?",15,0.5,0.628685474395752
0,0,well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger,15,0.5,0.41274330019950867
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6041836142539978
0,0,so we reckon maybe that 'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .,15,0.5,0.3980102241039276
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6195651888847351
0,0,"yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three four centimetres . plus maybe half o five",15,0.5,0.42679527401924133

0,0,"so i think before we close uh , we are expected i mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . i mean if you wan na go back to the last slide . uh",15,0.5,0.4074733555316925
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5154067873954773

1,0,"yeah , i think we 're i mean before we close the meeting , we 're supposed to come up with some ideas for",15,0.5,0.5499934554100037
1,0,oh k so we 're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or,15,0.5,0.5196124911308289
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5405792593955994
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5398173332214355

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.597420334815979
1,1,"so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . so , but uh le let 's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh ed was talking . and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so",15,0.5,0.5311077237129211
1,0,"mm-hmm . i think it depends , i mean i think it 's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it 's gon na be because theoretically with the t_v_ you already have a big display right in front of you .",15,0.5,0.580046534538269
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5746391415596008

1,0,"so , if we 're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .",15,0.5,0.7232747673988342
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3894244134426117

0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4473116099834442
1,0,"'cause if it 's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that 's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go ,",15,0.5,0.6331135034561157
0,0,"but that 's just sort of speculation , i mean .",15,0.5,0.4177284240722656
1,0,"what do you think ed ? do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ?",15,0.5,0.59870845079422

1,0,"okay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . we asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there 's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group .",15,0.5,0.5677061676979065

1,0,"okay . so we got some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . i often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it 's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . i remember trying to load a d_v_d_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me i do n't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there 's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . and if they do , not very often . takes too long to master the remote control . i 've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they 're just not great to use . we just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . some of the good stuff we got . between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . now do n't get excited yet , i 've got more to say on that . most people 'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . finally , my opinion .",15,0.5,0.658068060874939
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.19598722457885742
1,0,"the voice recognition thing is cool . and uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . it 's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you 're not gon na get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you ca n't have that many words . for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . i 'm pretty sure people would buy it . but after a while people may wan na return it , because if you have to to say som i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that 's for flickering through channels . so if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . however , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there 's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . but if we do have the voice recognition thing , there 's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . see , you could there 're two options . either you have voice recognition by itself , which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wan na be watching television and you wan na be quiet , or i do n't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote 's only trained for you , it 's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . as long as the voice recognition stuff works , that 's that 's fine .",15,0.5,0.7400991320610046

1,0,"so we have the three birds , we have the design , that we have the the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition 's fancy , it 's cool , it 's different , it 's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit i do n't remember so i 'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , i think is a big question . um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it 'll take to train the remote , 'cause i think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . and uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wan na use the t_v_ , they ca n't use the remote because they speak differently to you . um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . uh , will people return the remote control , i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so ,",15,0.5,0.7361950874328613

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.608953058719635
1,0,"press on . i 've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . um and was n't really satisfied by what i saw i have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on . um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . um to save you getting off your backside . um and there 's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . on the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . and most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . and on the other hand there 's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used . um with uh a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that 's relatively peripheral functions . and so you go for something that 's fairly intuitive to use , and um well f the for the most part for t_v_ remote it 's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a d_v_ d_v_d_ or uh v_c_r_ presumably into that then there 's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . um . my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . um but uh the pro i think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user 's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most . so , something that 's uh something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you 're most likely to want . um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , um i liked ebenezer 's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you 're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it 'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick 's going to do or wha or what each function button 's going to do . um , this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers , you know the playstation control where you have four basic function buttons",15,0.5,0.5461516380310059

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.48769599199295044
1,0,"um , i mean i imagine as well that the actual l_c_d_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . which maybe does n't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it .",15,0.5,0.5367031693458557
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6080799698829651
0,0,"um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , i mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there 's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined .",15,0.5,0.48507794737815857
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5053744912147522
1,0,"so like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . so that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do . and they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the t_v_",15,0.5,0.5882001519203186
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.42894843220710754
1,0,and who would normally use the unit .,15,0.5,0.6246631145477295
0,0,mm . i th the thing i like about the uh the uh joystick,15,0.5,0.44836118817329407
1,0,i dunno .,15,0.5,0.6314430832862854
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4613535702228546
1,0,"is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it i mean for for t_ t_ for t_v_ remote alone , you could put um i mean there are like i say the the the main things people do with a t_v_ remote control is the volume and the channel . you can pack all that onto was onto a single control . um .",15,0.5,0.6008343696594238

1,0,"but uh but the but then o uh obviously if uh you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation . i mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most t_v_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra",15,0.5,0.5360820889472961

1,0,"integrating the uh the remote with the device it 's controlling . um concern about our market . um , if we are i mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation . um , you 've got twenty different devices in your living room ,",15,0.5,0.5720729827880859
0,0,yeah . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4665592312812805
1,0,"you want one wo y you want one that 'll do the job of all of them . um , if all you 're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room , um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else .",15,0.5,0.6019624471664429
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4892268180847168
1,0,i just think that uh possibly,15,0.5,0.5976549983024597
1,0,"well this is a requirement that we have to stick to i 'm afraid ,",15,0.5,0.5299125909805298
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.41229045391082764

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.41287046670913696
1,0,"so i can understand your point , and i would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now . 'fraid to say . um",15,0.5,0.7263126969337463
0,0,does that um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ?,15,0.5,0.4651106297969818
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5293177366256714
1,0,"i would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . um i think that it i would say that the design spec we 've been with is for the television only for now .",15,0.5,0.5821999311447144
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5446822047233582
1,0,and until we hear otherwise we should go with just that .,15,0.5,0.5732539892196655
1,0,"hmm . okay , specifically television .",15,0.5,0.5075718760490417
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4354138672351837
1,0,"okay . maybe we 'll hear differently , but for now",15,0.5,0.5363447070121765
1,0,so the joystick is just for differentness .,15,0.5,0.5199040770530701
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5361639261245728

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5803865790367126
1,0,"just a thought . um maybe then our market should be t_v_ manufacturers , rather than the public . try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um",15,0.5,0.5755947232246399
1,0,"there is that possibility , yes . b however i do n't know exactly where we 'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the marketing expert ,",15,0.5,0.5504112839698792
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4176180958747864
1,0,"that might be sales , who are not in this meeting .",15,0.5,0.5808604955673218
1,0,"mm-hmm . it 's just , the way i figure it , twelve point five euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that ,",15,0.5,0.6230026483535767
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.32857373356819153
1,0,"not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , you know , like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls .",15,0.5,0.6688138842582703
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4654860496520996
0,0,we just is this gon na be enough to to sell ?,15,0.5,0.4233912229537964
0,0,"well , something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you 've done , in fact we 've probably all done .",15,0.5,0.49936291575431824
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5078108906745911
1,0,"um , i do n't know if it 's a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is .",15,0.5,0.5206445455551147
0,0,"mm , yeah , i 've seen them .",15,0.5,0.44904741644859314
0,0,"i had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up",15,0.5,0.41946959495544434
1,0,um . well,15,0.5,0.5586848258972168
0,0,because it it went off all the time accidentally .,15,0.5,0.450467973947525
1,0,the other option of course is that um the,15,0.5,0.5862841010093689
0,0,the clapping one .,15,0.5,0.39646798372268677
0,0,"well i was going to say clapping , um um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there 's a button , but maybe it 's a button that you attach to the t_v_ .",15,0.5,0.4772409200668335
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4621468186378479
1,0,to a television .,15,0.5,0.5114877820014954
1,0,"something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit .",15,0.5,0.5976142883300781
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4928743541240692
1,0,"yeah , i think that 's a good idea .",15,0.5,0.61812824010849
0,0,and that could be something could um separate us a bit .,15,0.5,0.4608718156814575
1,0,"yeah , that 's a good idea .",15,0.5,0.6129817366600037
1,0,"and that way , because we 're attaching what would be a small button to the t_v_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario i would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um i do n't power that might be something that we could look into .",15,0.5,0.5140578150749207
1,0,yeah,15,0.5,0.506309986114502
1,0,"yep . yeah , it 's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , so i mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well .",15,0.5,0.5751590132713318
0,0,"i think so , yeah .",15,0.5,0.47973939776420593

0,1,"can i ? so now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . so , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . and um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative .",15,0.5,0.46187761425971985
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.324655145406723

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4181536138057709

1,0,"hey that 's a cool one . we could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off .",15,0.5,0.6134750247001648
1,0,when it d uh takes a shock .,15,0.5,0.5565236210823059

0,0,yeah . yeah . yeah . i think it 's innovative to use the mm the wheel because i think no one else has .,15,0.5,0.48779281973838806

1,0,yeah that 's why i think we have to keep that if it 's possible .,15,0.5,0.5527710318565369
1,0,yeah . i think it 's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative .,15,0.5,0.6066150665283203

1,0,yeah ? uh is the new trend of the,15,0.5,0.5312889814376831

1,0,no i think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some,15,0.5,0.5464382171630859
1,0,"okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , you do n't wan na pear or a watermelon .",15,0.5,0.5939878225326538
1,0,yeah . don do n't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ?,15,0.5,0.72600919008255

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5549430251121521
0,0,"the thing is you have t normally with um with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you 're gon na have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build .",15,0.5,0.4826980233192444
1,0,i do n't th it will be rolling a lot .,15,0.5,0.5887582302093506
0,0,yeah but i li i like your idea that we should n't have a lot of buttons b buttons so,15,0.5,0.36667200922966003
1,0,okay . yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a l_c_d_ on a banana also .,15,0.5,0.5577106475830078
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6654500365257263

0,0,"so , i will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the",15,0.5,0.45308828353881836
0,0,so so you you you suggest to go f,15,0.5,0.354714572429657
1,0,"new inputs and also it 's i 'm not convinced about this l_c_d_ because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , it 's not just buying a new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying uh",15,0.5,0.6679632067680359
0,0,okay . s so you 're simply,15,0.5,0.2667914927005768
1,0,more things . it 's not so simple .,15,0.5,0.629193127155304

1,0,"for instance , yeah . yeah for for for given an an example yeah .",15,0.5,0.5165725350379944
0,0,okay good . so maybe you can go ahead ?,15,0.5,0.49592387676239014
1,1,"seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , so i do n't exactly what cost would be incurred . um i can see your point about the number keypad , but i 've i would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels .",15,0.5,0.5420546531677246
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5685259103775024
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5453212857246399
1,0,my feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well um having the use of the l_c_d_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be,15,0.5,0.5774738192558289
1,0,"yeah , actually if you 've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , becau it 's you know if you 're trying to remember what uh , you know , what number 's the discovery channel or whatever . it 's just irritating .",15,0.5,0.528063178062439
1,0,that 's a good point .,15,0.5,0.6503550410270691

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5570492744445801
0,0,you can incorporate names into the menu . okay .,15,0.5,0.491822212934494
0,0,so you,15,0.5,0.46364763379096985
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5133413076400757

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7059704661369324
1,0,"so what it looks like to me is we 'll use a large number of standard components , um , say something like um lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . um looks like we going for a double curved design . um i do n't know what cost implications there are in that . um , looks like we 're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . though i 'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame .",15,0.5,0.53095942735672

1,0,"do you think there 's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? i can see why it looks appealing , but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ?",15,0.5,0.6427667140960693

0,0,"i mean if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . if you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , and i think would look rather co i mean mi rather cool . i mean my drawing there does n't does n't do it justice , it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control ,",15,0.5,0.45836344361305237

0,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.47800999879837036
1,0,was there anything in your research,15,0.5,0.5455271601676941
1,0,"the noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep .",15,0.5,0.513709306716919
0,0,"y you know , you lose the monkey the banana ,",15,0.5,0.4192902743816376

1,0,"s oh , i was gon na talk about the programmable remote control . now i think it 'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t_v_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television .",15,0.5,0.6043809652328491
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3414113521575928

0,0,well basi basically the um for f for uh i mean e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the t_v_ responds to .,15,0.5,0.4837764501571655
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5663532018661499

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5954945087432861
1,0,"so um usually what 's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you 'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , and you 'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer",15,0.5,0.5755179524421692
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6207195520401001
1,0,and try the different codes that,15,0.5,0.5146374106407166
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5148435831069946
1,0,come under that manufacturer 's name 'til you find the right one .,15,0.5,0.551194429397583

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5803046226501465
1,0,"so that 's that 's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . but if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you 've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .",15,0.5,0.5175718665122986
1,0,"an interesting point is that if the person does n't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l_c_d_",15,0.5,0.5771561861038208
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4838763475418091

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6423436999320984

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.40758684277534485

1,0,it should be possible . i think it 's a good idea .,15,0.5,0.527921736240387
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5436006188392639
1,0,"s some kind of be i 've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays .",15,0.5,0.5883092284202576
1,0,to make a base or something ?,15,0.5,0.5916789174079895
1,0,"yes . yes , definitely . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5424110889434814
1,0,"yes , but is that handy ?",15,0.5,0.5135377049446106
1,0,"well , i well it 's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . that 's one .",15,0.5,0.5727438926696777
0,0,it 's it 's it 's it 's,15,0.5,0.365933895111084
1,0,and uh you can always find your remote control up,15,0.5,0.5558314323425293
0,0,"it 's not the purpose to be handy , it 's",15,0.5,0.33610716462135315
0,0,"but but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries .",15,0.5,0.46101871132850647
0,0,"uh , okay . well , maybe yeah , you could when that 's when it 's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger ,",15,0.5,0.49795466661453247
1,0,and then you,15,0.5,0.5132890939712524
1,0,"but you will you do need uh also an uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . does it makes it kinda",15,0.5,0.6294922828674316
0,0,yes . or,15,0.5,0.3778323829174042
1,0,"well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course .",15,0.5,0.6665568351745605
0,0,"mm . yeah , but that 's not it 's ugly , i think .",15,0.5,0.30754414200782776
1,0,"yeah , yeah . okay . yeah .",15,0.5,0.627703845500946
1,0,i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.5947420597076416
1,0,"yeah , but then it 's very easy to make it also a rechargeab i do n't think that is gon na cost much to make it also a recharge function in it .",15,0.5,0.5610899329185486
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.6163456439971924
0,0,"on the other hand , if you do n't do it , we can also make a nice bay . i mean , it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it ,",15,0.5,0.3965449333190918
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5458037257194519
1,0,but um i think the bay is definitely uh,15,0.5,0.5388807654380798
1,0,"i think it 's a good idea . and make it , you know , we we um well , we uh it 's it is n't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . we can save on the on the functions . we just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there 's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up ,",15,0.5,0.5298082828521729
0,0,"sure , why not . yep .",15,0.5,0.4725620746612549
1,0,"it 's also nice . and if you put it away , i think it 's uh w we have to we uh that 's uh",15,0.5,0.5076314806938171
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5666247010231018
1,0,it 's not a easy market .,15,0.5,0.566365122795105
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5209901332855225
1,0,"we have to something special . and for twenty five euros people want something remote c special from your mote control ,",15,0.5,0.6115283370018005
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4494946599006653
1,0,true .,15,0.5,0.607608437538147
0,0,"and we ca n't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions ,",15,0.5,0.478147029876709
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5298467874526978
1,0,definitely .,15,0.5,0.5587418079376221
1,0,because we are n't gon na put,15,0.5,0.5896246433258057
0,0,"with eye candy , ear candy , whatever . yeah , definitely .",15,0.5,0.49388331174850464
1,0,"yeah . and then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing . yeah . i think i think it 's a good idea .",15,0.5,0.5812064409255981
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.633804440498352
0,0,"yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have .",15,0.5,0.49602746963500977
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.646122395992279
1,0,"definitely , yeah .",15,0.5,0.513893723487854
1,0,"oh , if it let 's well , we will see what 's possible concerning the the costs , and if it 's possible we 'll do that . and we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing .",15,0.5,0.6369550824165344
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.49219435453414917
1,0,"and the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . if that 's too expensive , we wo n't do that .",15,0.5,0.5584873557090759
1,0,"yeah , we c",15,0.5,0.5345866084098816
1,0,but it would be nice .,15,0.5,0.5871241688728333
0,0,"it would be nice , yes .",15,0.5,0.38521695137023926
1,0,"it 's the idea . i know that batteries last long nowadays . and and what people just think about , well , i 'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it 's very annoying when your battery is empty . and you know then when you have n't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo i 've experienced that that",15,0.5,0.5965039730072021
0,0,"most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes .",15,0.5,0.498475581407547
0,0,"yeah , okay . so , easy functions . well , we will we will i think we 'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi",15,0.5,0.3483329713344574
0,0,or just give a beep when the battery 's out or uh down .,15,0.5,0.47584906220436096
1,0,yeah . but it 's also annoying .,15,0.5,0.5684061050415039
1,0,"yeah , why not .",15,0.5,0.5310156941413879
1,0,"'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you 're not very motivated to do something about it .",15,0.5,0.6069843769073486
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3733682930469513

0,0,"no , that 's true .",15,0.5,0.4989382028579712
1,0,"you do n't want to have ever have those problems , and you wo n't have if if you have the rechargeable . and you do n't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people do n't like it . uh , i i in the in the ma",15,0.5,0.5696530938148499
1,0,why not .,15,0.5,0.5326833128929138
0,0,but you pay for it .,15,0.5,0.44602376222610474
1,0,"yeah , but it w i mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that 's a great idea , i 'm gon na use it . and when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , i 'll never put him in the recharger , i think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . then when they look get m i i i know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they 're seeking for the remote control , they wan na see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh ,",15,0.5,0.5805374383926392
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5106407403945923

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5825050473213196
1,0,m maybe we should really do this .,15,0.5,0.5927315950393677
1,0,and you can leave it just there .,15,0.5,0.5031281113624573

1,1,"okay . uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the uh i_d_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and uh the u_i_d_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design ,",15,0.5,0.5415063500404358

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.48292601108551025
1,0,"um if you have any questions , you know , you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach , i suppose .",15,0.5,0.6138827204704285
1,0,wherever they 're hiding ?,15,0.5,0.5293073654174805

1,0,thank you very much .,15,0.5,0.6061012148857117
0,1,"'kay . uh i did n't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that i was given were frustrating .",15,0.5,0.43391644954681396
1,0,oh my bad .,15,0.5,0.528267502784729
1,0,oh that 's fine .,15,0.5,0.5544775724411011
1,0,"uh okay , so method method of our design , i think i just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this .",15,0.5,0.5200291872024536
1,0,help me .,15,0.5,0.6337791681289673
0,0,"we need a power source , we 're gon na need a smart chip if we 're gon na make it multi-functional . um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .",15,0.5,0.4551885724067688
1,0,what exactly is a smart chip ?,15,0.5,0.609684407711029
1,0,usually a smart chip is just a chip that 's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions .,15,0.5,0.5041669607162476
1,0,"well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? is that gon na push us over our production costs ?",15,0.5,0.5637419819831848
1,0,"i would n't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . and they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap .",15,0.5,0.5729552507400513
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4767615497112274
1,0,okay . ready ?,15,0.5,0.5426262021064758
0,0,"um yep , nothing here .",15,0.5,0.42022210359573364
1,0,that 's okay .,15,0.5,0.5116961598396301
1,0,"um power source , i figured , batteries , 'cause they 're easily available . typically a remote has either two double a_s or four triple a_s , sometimes three . uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself .",15,0.5,0.5696597099304199
0,0,"um a large on-off button , demographically we 're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good .",15,0.5,0.4126494228839874
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3375002145767212
1,0,"selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the d_v_d_ player or the t_v_ or the stereo system . um smart chip that perverts uh that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that 'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that 's kinda it .",15,0.5,0.684638500213623
1,0,uh this is my fifty second design .,15,0.5,0.5418916344642639
0,0,"power source over here . we 're gon na have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you 're gon na need the switch . um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to .",15,0.5,0.4064421057701111
1,0,"so what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?",15,0.5,0.6751475930213928
0,0,this is just like a rough schematic .,15,0.5,0.3048889935016632
1,0,so this would be the front ?,15,0.5,0.6599738597869873
0,0,so this is the internal workings .,15,0.5,0.29564398527145386
1,0,"so the red would be the front of the remote though , right ?",15,0.5,0.5802576541900635
0,0,oh okay .,15,0.5,0.38306882977485657
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5167495608329773
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5625666379928589
1,0,"yeah , that 's gon na be what 's communicating with the t_v_ , but the other bulb , i think , is good to just to indicate , i 'm doing something , it 's sort of like a reassurance .",15,0.5,0.6351995468139648
1,0,the l the light up kind of,15,0.5,0.5357465147972107
1,0,"yeah , so you do n't have to stare at that infra-red ,",15,0.5,0.5409041047096252
1,0,like that we know the battery 's working .,15,0.5,0.6263400912284851
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3676452934741974
1,0,"'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when i push this button , is it working ?",15,0.5,0.6209450960159302
0,0,"hmm . it 'd probably be lighting up the key too ,",15,0.5,0.33176669478416443
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5171593427658081
1,0,we can skip that whole thing .,15,0.5,0.6296534538269043
0,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.4525642693042755

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6530307531356812
0,0,so you can put it in the dark .,15,0.5,0.45873916149139404
0,0,the buttons .,15,0.5,0.49729886651039124
1,0,"yeah , and that 's good .",15,0.5,0.5364250540733337
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6116276979446411
0,0,we should make it glow in the dark .,15,0.5,0.4045887887477875
1,0,"yeah , definitely . 'kay nex r ready ?",15,0.5,0.6590594053268433

0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.47826921939849854
0,0,"anything you wan na add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . anything else ?",15,0.5,0.4620514214038849
0,0,"i think that that 's a good idea , because you know that 's one of the most important buttons .",15,0.5,0.40914490818977356
0,0,just,15,0.5,0.45949214696884155
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5310952067375183
0,0,"well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that i had , they were swi quite small . so should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ?",15,0.5,0.34802043437957764
1,0,"i think we should . like i think that would be in a as in like in for the design , sorry , um . i think we should definitely go with buttons that do n't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons ,",15,0.5,0.5767711400985718
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.31379425525665283
1,0,i think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .,15,0.5,0.6580469012260437
0,1,"okay . right . conceptual design meeting . right . okay , so right well um from the last meeting i was trying to send you the minutes , but uh it did n't work out too well , so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , i can quickly give you what we what we had .",15,0.5,0.4669976532459259
0,1,"uh yeah , if i can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on .",15,0.5,0.4855404198169708
1,0,"and while you 're doing that we 'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we 're all gon na have to be able to walk around .",15,0.5,0.5748967528343201
0,0,"uh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal .",15,0.5,0.4605385959148407
1,0,do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? um,15,0.5,0.5295534729957581
1,0,"uh i do not think so ,",15,0.5,0.5800176858901978
0,0,are we all gon na draw a cat ?,15,0.5,0.42195504903793335
0,0,i think it 's just to try out the whiteboard . ah .,15,0.5,0.47408950328826904
1,0,only animal i could thin i could draw .,15,0.5,0.516054093837738
1,0,i know .,15,0.5,0.5897716283798218
1,0,its a sort of bunny rabbit cat .,15,0.5,0.5546849966049194

1,0,'kay . is on . right . okay . i will take this time just to apologise .,15,0.5,0.5804237127304077
1,0,"i , i only , uh , received my emails later on . 'cause i was too busy carried away doing my own thing ,",15,0.5,0.5256408452987671
0,0,which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing .,15,0.5,0.4980548322200775
0,0,but there we go .,15,0.5,0.4143253266811371
1,0,i 'm sure it 's fine .,15,0.5,0.5106135010719299
1,0,"um , so i was looking at how we 're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . and it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . they do n't need to actually manually touch the television set . so , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . um , from uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there 're certain points that will make our product unique . um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um genevieve 's idea . so we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . and we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we 're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . a automatically , um lights up at first touch . or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . um , also we could use um an alarm . so if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . maybe behind a cushion or somewhere .",15,0.5,0.5707021355628967
1,0,"um , so that would work . um , oop . go back there . um , another thing i think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . um , from previous researches i 've carried out on other projects , um we 've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory .",15,0.5,0.5283492803573608
0,0,"so they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . so , for example , a screw that 's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . so um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . so , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and i think that would be very important for products now . especially 'cause there 's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .",15,0.5,0.4867999255657196
1,0,"right , um , one question . this , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ?",15,0.5,0.5413994789123535
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5008659362792969
1,0,"so that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?",15,0.5,0.589974045753479
0,0,"um and then yeah . yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . and that 's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . i mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it 's the product 's responsibility to get rid of what they 've made . um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components ,",15,0.5,0.41419079899787903
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6151424050331116
0,0,"and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gon na wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . something like the case , if it 's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .",15,0.5,0.4479934871196747
1,0,"mm-hmm . would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? or would we contribute to another group ?",15,0.5,0.5836220383644104
1,0,"you could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . for a certain percentage at least .",15,0.5,0.5049864053726196
0,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.4909341633319855
1,0,"not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce ,",15,0.5,0.5514545440673828
0,0,okay . this sounds like a really great idea .,15,0.5,0.4608878791332245
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.43708980083465576
1,0,one thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .,15,0.5,0.5396333336830139
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.49788469076156616
1,0,"um , so we 'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company ,",15,0.5,0.5710502862930298
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4756496250629425
1,0,"um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . you would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .",15,0.5,0.6153411865234375
0,0,"well i the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they do n't need to be manually de um deconstructed . like , you do n't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . because of this , their properties are smart material .",15,0.5,0.42280110716819763
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6085410714149475
0,0,"all you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves .",15,0.5,0.49721819162368774
1,0,alright . we 'll still have to investigate the financial implications .,15,0.5,0.5687052607536316
1,0,"so i suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but",15,0.5,0.5552642345428467
0,0,"alright . i like the environmental approach . um , we 'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well .",15,0.5,0.4785357415676117
1,0,yeah . okay . um also there is um components . this 'll be how it uh will actually work . but i have n't put this plan together yet .,15,0.5,0.6008336544036865
1,0,"i 'm sorry , could you",15,0.5,0.583272397518158
1,0,there we go,15,0.5,0.509670615196228
0,0,those were um,15,0.5,0.4817049205303192
1,0,". sorry , should i go back . this would actually show the circuit diagram . although i have n't come up with the final circuit yet .",15,0.5,0.5229600071907043
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4753623306751251
1,0,so i just put all those components in .,15,0.5,0.5164735913276672
0,0,"so those are what , um , we 'll c construct the remote . those are all the",15,0.5,0.4539349675178528
1,0,"yeah . i it just shows what sort of energy source . it could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . um , an ' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself .",15,0.5,0.5735681653022766
0,0,alright . great .,15,0.5,0.472685307264328
1,0,"okay ? so , now is it f_ eight again to escape ? or escape ? there we go . okay .",15,0.5,0.662315845489502
1,0,"alright . thank you very much . and , um , the next presenter will be tara .",15,0.5,0.6336734890937805

1,0,"oh ,",15,0.5,0.504574179649353
0,0,"do you think is it uh , function eight yeah ?",15,0.5,0.4590030312538147
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6856325268745422
1,0,function f_ eight .,15,0.5,0.6507465243339539

0,0,function f_ eight . sorry .,15,0.5,0.4719673991203308
0,0,the one at the top .,15,0.5,0.3237916827201843
1,0,oh right . okay .,15,0.5,0.5749014616012573
1,0,that looks right .,15,0.5,0.5072885751724243
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.54971843957901
1,0,"okay . i 'm the user um user interface designer . uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . um , in this case it 's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . by taking inspiration from other similar designs , we 'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . there 're two functional design options . a multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . and a single function remote control , used specifically for the television .",15,0.5,0.6144000887870789
0,0,"i 'm sorry , what was that last one . multifunctional and",15,0.5,0.4980078935623169
1,0,"sorry . um , a single function just for the television itself .",15,0.5,0.5262174010276794
0,0,"ch oh , i see .",15,0.5,0.47215574979782104
1,0,"yeah . um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . a single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .",15,0.5,0.5421760082244873
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.45723626017570496
1,0,"um , i think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it 's easier to use . it 'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . and less functions would have to be included . so it would be cheaper to make . and probably more sellable just because it 's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . does anyone have any questions ?",15,0.5,0.5149427056312561
1,0,"so as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?",15,0.5,0.6405009031295776
0,0,"well , it 's just that , when we 're creating it , we 're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices .",15,0.5,0.3828474283218384
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5902063250541687
1,0,"and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent ,",15,0.5,0.5514005422592163

1,0,other entertainment devices .,15,0.5,0.5380489230155945
1,0,"does everyone agree with this ? does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?",15,0.5,0.5816118121147156
1,0,"um , i was just wondering about the , what , what genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . and that would probably , um , i d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . i suppose having that would complicate it a lot more .",15,0.5,0.503332793712616
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5371674299240112
1,0,and limit the design . do you think ?,15,0.5,0.5757063627243042
1,0,"yeah , i think i agree with the single design thing for now , because we 're trying to do so much , that if we 're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it 's also multi also multifunctional , um , we 're gon na go over budget for one thing .",15,0.5,0.5384379625320435
1,0,yeah . yeah . that 's true . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5769113302230835
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6142553091049194
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5580871105194092
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.558967113494873
1,0,yeah . and with this we 'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design .,15,0.5,0.5264293551445007
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6043326258659363
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5578308701515198
1,0,we 'll have more money to go into the design side of it .,15,0.5,0.6255933046340942
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.42647913098335266
1,0,okay . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5976518392562866

1,0,are you ready for your presentation genevieve ?,15,0.5,0.5465654134750366
1,0,yes i am .,15,0.5,0.5552587509155273
1,0,fabulous . except you 're not hooked up to the,15,0.5,0.5600107312202454

1,0,great .,15,0.5,0.5234346985816956
1,0,okay . okay . oh . i just lost my microphone .,15,0.5,0.5816001296043396
0,0,"no problem ,",15,0.5,0.4796781539916992
1,0,just a moment .,15,0.5,0.5362007021903992
1,0,we can,15,0.5,0.5841489434242249
0,0,"okay . so i 'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . um , and i 'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? the functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . um , so what i 'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . um , i 've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . and i 'll show you my findings . oh , and firstly i wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . so i think that should be our priority here . um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . not just in electronic fashion . so that it 's something that fits in the household .",15,0.5,0.4752975404262543
1,0,"i 'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ?",15,0.5,0.5697305798530579
0,0,"um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design .",15,0.5,0.33751922845840454
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4752350151538849
1,0,"any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media ,",15,0.5,0.513884425163269

1,0,"you know who 's famous , what t_v_ shows are being watched ,",15,0.5,0.5644434094429016
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4384056329727173
1,0,"um , to influence our remote control . okay , so the findings . um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . which is a , quite a significant number .",15,0.5,0.5534318685531616
0,0,"um , the other twenty five percent did n't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .",15,0.5,0.38935282826423645
0,0,"i 'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . you mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ?",15,0.5,0.3508601188659668
0,0,"yeah , they 're willing , they 're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality .",15,0.5,0.38766562938690186
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.35363849997520447
0,0,"as opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control .",15,0.5,0.45630520582199097
0,0,mm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.3575913608074188
1,0,"um , so it is something that people care about . it 's not , it 's not ignored in the household . um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . zapping meaning they go through channels a lot .",15,0.5,0.6572181582450867
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3189679682254791
1,0,"they 're you know thumb-masters . um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . that a very small amount . thought that was interesting .",15,0.5,0.6062719225883484
0,0,"alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons .",15,0.5,0.42585650086402893
0,0,mm . the single function .,15,0.5,0.402078241109848
1,0,"and another thing with um lots of surfing , we 'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable ,",15,0.5,0.540587842464447
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4159952700138092
1,0,"because i find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they 're printed on the button .",15,0.5,0.5672925114631653
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4715021550655365
1,0,yeah that 's a good point .,15,0.5,0.6215937733650208
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5850151777267456
1,0,"and actually to go with that , i 'm gon na give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they 're used . and uh how important the uh users find them . so the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . hopefully the person 's not turning on and off the t_v_ . um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . so people wan na be able to turn on the t_v_ with the remote control . um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour .",15,0.5,0.5851316452026367
1,0,"that 's a huge amount . this is the most important button . um , so obviously when commercials come on they 're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that 's not gon na run down . relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . and it 's used on average four times an hour . not as much as channel selection , but still significant . um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . relevance is two . screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . um , and relevance of one point five . we 're getting to specific statistics here . teletext , um , now i 'm not too clear on what that is . i do n't know if you can help me . flipping pages .",15,0.5,0.5367960929870605
1,0,it 's um,15,0.5,0.5627725124359131
0,0,is that,15,0.5,0.49972662329673767
1,0,it 's like the news . or like information .,15,0.5,0.5419241786003113
1,0,"it has t_v_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment .",15,0.5,0.5216078162193298
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5465734004974365

1,0,it 's um,15,0.5,0.5280601978302002
1,0,and what 's on .,15,0.5,0.5318971276283264
0,0,"so like a running banner , underneath",15,0.5,0.4692058861255646
0,0,"no it 's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up .",15,0.5,0.3863886594772339
1,0,"no , li yeah .",15,0.5,0.6141950488090515

1,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.5100297927856445
0,0,it 's like,15,0.5,0.48033252358436584
1,0,"and you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it 'll come up .",15,0.5,0.6003520488739014
0,0,"it 's like very basic internet . sort of ,",15,0.5,0.49271366000175476
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6165775656700134
1,0,"very basic internet , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6343268156051636
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.5752530694007874
0,0,but you have,15,0.5,0.4941363036632538
0,0,"okay . like tells you the weather , and",15,0.5,0.4832794964313507
1,0,"yeah . but you have no interaction back with it , you know .",15,0.5,0.5763159990310669
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.442065954208374
1,0,like the internet you can send emails and you 've no interaction .,15,0.5,0.6138079166412354
1,0,"yeah , it 's just information that um , like television timetables , what 's on , what 's on now , what 's on next , on every channel , and",15,0.5,0.5124632120132446
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5729332566261292
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5107038021087646
1,0,"alright . well i guess i 'm not with it , because i was n't but it 's , it 's being used fourteen times an hour . um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . so it looks like something that we 're gon na want to do some research on and include on our remote control .",15,0.5,0.6124874949455261
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4983404874801636
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6097772717475891
1,0,"um , channel settings . zero point zero one times an hour . relevance of three . channel settings .",15,0.5,0.5968411564826965
1,0,"uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ?",15,0.5,0.5394635796546936
1,0,p sorry . changing the channels ?,15,0.5,0.6410679817199707
0,0,"tuning them in at the very start . you know if you get a new t_v_ set , you tune in all the channels ,",15,0.5,0.4826919138431549
1,0,"to get the right reception and picture , i suppose .",15,0.5,0.5373070240020752
0,0,do you th do you think ?,15,0.5,0.4607338011264801
0,0,"oh , okay .",15,0.5,0.49812865257263184
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.542319655418396
1,0,yeah . okay .,15,0.5,0.6075260639190674
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.2902911603450775
1,0,"um , so it 's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . okay . um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . remote controls are often lost somewhere . so that was already discussed by poppy . how we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .",15,0.5,0.5749236941337585
1,0,"so it should be very user-friendly , you know . people know what to do very quickly . um , remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ .",15,0.5,0.5068418383598328
0,0,repetitive strain injury .,15,0.5,0.3460865020751953
1,0,repeti uh .,15,0.5,0.6106917858123779
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.425497829914093
0,0,i think .,15,0.5,0.45315292477607727
1,0,is that what it is ? people with arthritis and such ?,15,0.5,0.6270026564598083
0,0,that 's rather sad .,15,0.5,0.39830705523490906
1,0,"um , maybe our",15,0.5,0.5260756611824036
0,0,"oh , i 'm guessing that 's what it is . i 'm not",15,0.5,0.4878057539463043
1,0,"yeah , yeah . i think it is .",15,0.5,0.6334152221679688
0,0,"designers can look into that . um , buttons that do n't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond .",15,0.5,0.4618920385837555
1,0,mm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5763654112815857
0,0,"but we 'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . that 's a problem .",15,0.5,0.42438459396362305
1,0,yeah . it is .,15,0.5,0.5835919976234436
1,0,okay . did you guys uh get that one down ?,15,0.5,0.5668720006942749
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.578055739402771
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.33769068121910095
1,0,"um okay , here 's some ideas for you . a large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . so i 'll show you some numbers here . um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . um , that would , are willing to pay extra . so i guess we 're gon na have to figure out what age group we 're , we 're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wan na look into . and if we have the budget for it . um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .",15,0.5,0.6671598553657532
0,0,"i agree with um if we 're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . um , financially and and functionally .",15,0.5,0.43885236978530884
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4306122958660126
1,0,"um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that .",15,0.5,0.5825884938240051
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.22759200632572174
1,0,"um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably wo n't be as concerned .",15,0.5,0.676088273525238
0,0,"so that , that 's a whole other field of research . i do n't know if it 'd be , if we 'd still have a remote , or if you 're talking to your television and saying change channel .",15,0.5,0.4400039315223694
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5057334303855896
0,0,um and depending on how many members you have in households .,15,0.5,0.43321695923805237
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7122076153755188
1,0,"so it m it may be too complicated for us , but it 's something to keep in mind anyway .",15,0.5,0.5167046785354614
1,0,yeah . and something that might further complicate it is that the t_v_ makes noise itself .,15,0.5,0.5664854645729065
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5556036233901978
1,0,wonder if it would have,15,0.5,0.5744166374206543
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.639165461063385
1,0,"and if there was conversation in the room at the same time ,",15,0.5,0.5140154957771301
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6127186417579651
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5896977186203003
1,0,"although in theory it does n't tend to be when you 're watching television ,",15,0.5,0.5672531723976135
1,0,but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design .,15,0.5,0.6406019330024719
0,0,"yeah . if we 're looking for a simplistic design , if",15,0.5,0.4403832256793976
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.42186877131462097
0,0,"we need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design .",15,0.5,0.4995289146900177
0,0,yeah . mm .,15,0.5,0.47777146100997925
1,0,"um , because if , if it is then i think voice , um voice-activated",15,0.5,0.6230700612068176
0,0,it looks like,15,0.5,0.3375958800315857
1,0,"yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing ,",15,0.5,0.6589925289154053
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.2627872824668884
1,0,"because if people can activate the television with their voice then they wo n't be using a , they wo n't be talking into a remote , i 'm sure .",15,0.5,0.5857264399528503
0,0,"it 'd be like the ultimate remote . um okay . and th the last thing here was a , an l_c_d_ screen . so , i mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . not practical . um an l_c_d_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this powerpoint is working .",15,0.5,0.4010661542415619
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5220214128494263
0,0,so that you do n't have so many buttons to deal with .,15,0.5,0.4826095998287201
1,0,"um , i do n't know what an l_c_d_ screen is .",15,0.5,0.5640528798103333
1,0,"oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . s or like um",15,0.5,0.5236421823501587
1,0,mobile phone .,15,0.5,0.6772379875183105
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.2744731605052948
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5461245775222778
1,0,"yeah . or like an alarm clock . you 'd have an l_c_d_ versus just a , a normal clock .",15,0.5,0.6748884320259094
0,0,"what , what would appear on the screen ?",15,0.5,0.49543488025665283
1,0,i have no idea still . i 'm sorry .,15,0.5,0.6519961953163147
0,0,"oh just like an electronic screen . as opposed to just buttons . there would be like a little , like on",15,0.5,0.36218029260635376
1,0,"oh , on the remote . okay .",15,0.5,0.6218827366828918
0,0,"yeah . like on the top of a cellphone , the the little l_c_d_ screen .",15,0.5,0.4819166958332062
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7098521590232849
1,0,"um , now that 's , i , i dunno exactly what exactly we 'd put on there . i guess the channel that you 're on , the v the volume setting .",15,0.5,0.5444630980491638
1,0,"yeah . could it it it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . but that would probably be",15,0.5,0.5290632843971252
1,0,"like linked in with the teletext ,",15,0.5,0.5082545876502991
1,0,"yeah . that would be good , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5418911576271057
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5704455375671387
0,0,"or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .",15,0.5,0.45356231927871704
1,0,yeah . might be quite expensive to do that though .,15,0.5,0.575139582157135
0,0,"mm , yeah . could be .",15,0.5,0.41704967617988586
1,0,well i guess that 's something we can all take back to our respective research .,15,0.5,0.6334217190742493
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.4660773277282715
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5140088200569153
1,0,"um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . um , i think our priority really should be unique design . um , we want something that people want in their home . every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . so the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people .",15,0.5,0.5738041400909424
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.34243232011795044
1,0,"um , i th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off .",15,0.5,0.7062275409698486
0,0,"so if we 're , if we 're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product",15,0.5,0.31238871812820435
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.42188429832458496
1,0,"um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . i mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . but if we wan na make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics .",15,0.5,0.6426071524620056
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.39862000942230225
1,0,"and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend on a remote control . like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they 're just starting out",15,0.5,0.5822648406028748
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.39221999049186707
0,0,"and , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4857180416584015
1,0,"right . and we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . i mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah i 'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that 's three months allowance .",15,0.5,0.5822237133979797
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.48767074942588806
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6112511157989502
1,0,"um , so i i think , i think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more .",15,0.5,0.5570924878120422
0,0,"early twenties , that 's the kind of age group .",15,0.5,0.47798454761505127
1,0,"yeah . and if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control ,",15,0.5,0.6489089727401733
0,0,twenties .,15,0.5,0.37455230951309204
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4728379249572754
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5848874449729919
1,0,i 'm sure that something like an l_c_d_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .,15,0.5,0.5061279535293579
1,0,yeah . complicated jus complicating things even fo mm .,15,0.5,0.5710680484771729
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.33894971013069153

1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.5486860871315002
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.39164525270462036
1,0,okay . that 's it for the market research .,15,0.5,0.6290276050567627
0,0,"okay . before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , i 've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . um , for one thing , because having controls with d_v_d_ , v_c_r_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . um , we 've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . which is good as , as we 've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . um , for many reasons . so um we have that decision sort of made for us . another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . and so uh we wo n't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option .",15,0.5,0.4328131675720215
1,0,can i just interrupt ?,15,0.5,0.5376532077789307

1,0,would you like to plug in your,15,0.5,0.636913001537323
1,0,yeah . maybe we can do the,15,0.5,0.5003345608711243
1,0,"okay , sure .",15,0.5,0.607671320438385
0,0,have you got a powerpoint or not ?,15,0.5,0.37643495202064514
1,0,yeah i do . i 'm looking at looking at it right now .,15,0.5,0.7898932695388794
1,0,okay . thanks .,15,0.5,0.5150251984596252

1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5024375319480896
1,0,"were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?",15,0.5,0.6234574317932129
1,0,"um , well , i mean we do n't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control ,",15,0.5,0.5682516694068909
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5322290658950806
0,0,but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used .,15,0.5,0.4724162817001343
0,1,oh right okay . i cover myself up .,15,0.5,0.48971235752105713

1,0,"and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what 's going on . um what we are gon na talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it 's a t_v_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh r_ and d_ for that , that 's research and development for those that have n't heard that before ,",15,0.5,0.5955038666725159

0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.4244217872619629
1,0,"um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which would n't be v would n't be v v",15,0.5,0.5513991117477417

1,0,"well , there 's sometimes combinations , i mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .",15,0.5,0.5748206377029419

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4422817826271057

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3887236416339874
1,0,but i do n't know if it 's worth the cost . so we 've got to discuss that .,15,0.5,0.5947465896606445
0,0,"mm . okay , jolly good .",15,0.5,0.3204130530357361
1,0,"for the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . you can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what i mean , so",15,0.5,0.5535203218460083
0,0,what 's a double curved one ?,15,0.5,0.4877312183380127
0,0,"you know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .",15,0.5,0.36374861001968384
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5932417511940002
1,0,"so um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . and th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you ca n't use it for if you if we 're choosing a double curved case , we ca n't choose titanium . and if we are choosing um solar cells then we ca n't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . but if we 're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . and i think we discussed earlier on the r_ s_ i_ problem thing , so we could uh",15,0.5,0.611699640750885
0,0,"so that might be an idea of using the rubber ,",15,0.5,0.426879346370697
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5116369724273682

1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5649304986000061
1,0,so rubber would be okay .,15,0.5,0.6473104953765869
0,0,i think rubber 's,15,0.5,0.44614845514297485
1,0,"rubber , we 're all we 're all going we 're all liking that idea ? you think you can market that ?",15,0.5,0.5838921666145325
0,0,"but after my after my fashion thing , i think you 'll realise that rubber is more",15,0.5,0.37184053659439087
0,0,"ooh , we like rubber , ooh .",15,0.5,0.47756054997444153
0,0,uh s so if d,15,0.5,0.4179042875766754
1,0,people .,15,0.5,0.6620813608169556
0,0,"okay . and then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um l_c_d_ , which gives you a display . um scroll buttons , as well .",15,0.5,0.37680497765541077
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.6487994194030762
1,0,"so if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . so if we 're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .",15,0.5,0.5464004874229431
0,0,"well , we 're gon na go with i think we 've decided that it 's gon na be a rubber case so",15,0.5,0.47636356949806213
0,0,"so it 's a constraint . yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? if it 's not a double curved , then we 've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it 's a double curve , we 've got ta go for rubber push-buttons . if that makes sense .",15,0.5,0.43184030055999756

1,0,"if it 's rubber , is n't it malleable anyway , it does n't matter if it 's double i mean is n't a rubber case , mean it 's completely flexed , i mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? mean so what 's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?",15,0.5,0.5040609240531921
0,0,rubble double double .,15,0.5,0.34999334812164307

1,0,"i 'll have a big mac , please .",15,0.5,0.508476734161377
0,0,"then you have the case is uh , whether it 's flat or curved . and that 's we do n't care if it 's rub rubber or not , but then we 've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . so if we 've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it 's flat , single curved or double curved . and i 'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go i dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . so , either",15,0.5,0.39291873574256897
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4212636649608612

0,0,"let 's have rubber push buttons , hey .",15,0.5,0.3999098539352417
1,0,okay . go rubber . go rubber the whole way .,15,0.5,0.5579138398170471
1,0,"let 's go crazy . and then , do i have a last slide ? yes , i do . um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that 's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons .",15,0.5,0.5397850871086121
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7049067616462708
1,0,"um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gon na be the cheapest . uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that 's a higher price range . if we get an advanced chip which is um used for the l_c_d_ , the display thing , then that 's even more expensive .",15,0.5,0.5649161338806152
0,0,"simple , yeah . chip on print . it 's a bit . okay , uh what i 'm not understanding here",15,0.5,0.4079545736312866
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5904605388641357
0,0,"is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which i presume is like one p_c_b_ and that 's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?",15,0.5,0.4876367449760437
1,0,. yeah .,15,0.5,0.6489706039428711
1,0,the infra-red . yeah .,15,0.5,0.7046716213226318
0,0,right . um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?,15,0.5,0.42325344681739807
1,0,"well , if if it 's not chip on print then , i guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and does n't include the infra-red . it 's less expensive mm",15,0.5,0.5214695930480957
1,0,so it sounds,15,0.5,0.6549451351165771
0,0,"technically speaking , it 's not as advanced , but it does the job , too .",15,0.5,0.4990440011024475

1,0,"yeah , yeah . i agree .",15,0.5,0.6501558423042297
0,0,you know . so let 's not let 's uh not bother with the chip on print .,15,0.5,0.4304905831813812
1,0,so it 's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .,15,0.5,0.643122136592865
1,0,"yeah . s yeah , push buttons .",15,0.5,0.5558306574821472
1,0,what about the just developed uh sample sensor ?,15,0.5,0.56329345703125
1,0,i think push-buttons is,15,0.5,0.5006489157676697
1,0,what about what ?,15,0.5,0.6143105626106262
1,0,"g there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .",15,0.5,0.5387715697288513

0,0,yeah . it 's not something that we wan na t go into with this product .,15,0.5,0.3628430664539337
0,0,"'cause uh the yeah the example that they 're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um that when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . so you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello rick , or whatever .",15,0.5,0.4838785231113434

0,0,"oh , it just gives an answer .",15,0.5,0.36165863275527954

1,0,like you talk to it . can i have channel five ?,15,0.5,0.5009548664093018
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6350882053375244
1,0,it it 's just a remote that talks to you .,15,0.5,0.5183525681495667
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5258830785751343

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5560894012451172

1,0,"'kay . yeah , i 'm fine with the basic battery .",15,0.5,0.5096989274024963

1,0,cheaper option . are you happy with that ?,15,0.5,0.6055238246917725
0,0,mm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.3499050438404083
1,0,"okay . so we 'll go for the battery . then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?",15,0.5,0.7378424406051636

1,0,the the,15,0.5,0.5013843178749084

1,0,"the double whopper , please .",15,0.5,0.5096472501754761
1,0,"okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons ,",15,0.5,0.537387490272522
0,0,"yep , but we 're going for the simple buttons .",15,0.5,0.31976425647735596

1,0,so that 's another marketing point that we can use .,15,0.5,0.7402993440628052
0,0,well the rubber push-buttons . do n't you have to move your,15,0.5,0.4427086412906647
0,0,but anything is gon na have buttons .,15,0.5,0.36147621273994446

0,0,"even if it 's a jog wheel , it 's still repetitive . you",15,0.5,0.4849414825439453
0,0,i thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a,15,0.5,0.37933140993118286
0,0,"you see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen .",15,0.5,0.4411134123802185
1,0,that they do n't .,15,0.5,0.604221522808075
1,0,it 's the v it 's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement .,15,0.5,0.5782076716423035

1,0,.,15,0.5,0.5561213493347168
1,0,it 's not actually what you are doing .,15,0.5,0.6014664769172668
1,0,but the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-r_s_i_ ps specific,15,0.5,0.5303294658660889
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3241059184074402
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7294070720672607
0,0,"yeah , the rubber 's good .",15,0.5,0.4603259563446045
0,0,"we 're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah .",15,0.5,0.49880197644233704
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5297588109970093
1,0,"yeah , so they can sit there and go like",15,0.5,0.6094188690185547
1,0,not that watching t_v_ should be that stressful .,15,0.5,0.5800451636314392
0,0,"and you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah .",15,0.5,0.4968665540218353
1,0,"oh yeah , i guess t_v_ can be stressful , yeah , if you 're watching sports .",15,0.5,0.578406572341919
1,0,"alright , that 's me done .",15,0.5,0.6907370686531067
0,0,"okay , gabriel . let 's um let 's let 's hear from you about the um it 's the interface .",15,0.5,0.4655877351760864
1,0,"alright . alright . yeah , some of what i have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about .",15,0.5,0.6246228218078613
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.49827003479003906
1,0,sorry .,15,0.5,0.5574929118156433
1,0,"okay , so i 'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . and so basically i consulted with our manufacturing division . it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them . uh i also took uh reissa 's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause i think that 's that 's crucial as far as uh what keys we 're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they 're laid out .",15,0.5,0.581440269947052
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.38023805618286133
0,0,"uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . so i already mentioned the speech recognition interface .",15,0.5,0.4831879138946533
1,0,"i guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . it 's it 's pointless .",15,0.5,0.5369518995285034
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4532633423805237
1,0,"uh it 's just a sample sensor sample output . it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the t_v_ . uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m_p_ three player like ipod .",15,0.5,0.5747097134590149
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3543524444103241
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.39573532342910767
1,0,um so we 've already addressed that and i think that would actually be worse for something like r_s_i_ i mean you got that thumb movement that you 're constantly doing .,15,0.5,0.5924532413482666
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5563026666641235
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4760534167289734
1,0,"um the other suggestion ,",15,0.5,0.5575583577156067
1,0,that does get annoying .,15,0.5,0.5433223843574524
1,0,"and i i have a feeling that we 're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or ,",15,0.5,0.5200536847114563
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5382700562477112
0,0,"or uh something for the elderly , where the remote 's very large and the buttons are very large and there 's only a few buttons . but you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well .",15,0.5,0.44195184111595154
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5869926810264587
1,0,"uh um so , the key layout and design are really crucial . you do n't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . and i did n't mention that we need a power button in our last i can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout",15,0.5,0.5407000780105591
0,0,"uh from our manufacturing department . so this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a v_ on both of them , so uh",15,0.5,0.425769180059433
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5973231792449951
1,0,it 's sort of confusing for the user . uh this is the example of the giant remote that 's impossible to lose .,15,0.5,0.6018251180648804
0,0,do we have an uh example of a good one ? brilliant .,15,0.5,0.33862271904945374
0,0,uh-huh . well,15,0.5,0.49612849950790405
1,0,and for something for kids . yeah . um .,15,0.5,0.5296434164047241
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5238205790519714
1,0,"and so , yeah , i th i think my personal preferences of we 've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . uh so i was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . i think it should be more general .",15,0.5,0.5935191512107849
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4256775677204132
1,0,"i did n't i did n't think the spinning-wheel or the uh l_c_ display were were crucial for us . and , yeah , that 's it for me .",15,0.5,0.6482758522033691
0,0,okay . well let 's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? the um the the um the interface type we 're going for,15,0.5,0.49809175729751587
1,0,so we 're we 're not gon na have any sort of display i think uh .,15,0.5,0.5625520944595337
0,0,just the simple s simple straight set of buttons .,15,0.5,0.4628080725669861
0,0,"so , yeah , it 's just gon na be just gon na be push-buttons . um . i think we shall have a limited number of buttons ,",15,0.5,0.4275969862937927
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6147388219833374
1,0,"ideally , i mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .",15,0.5,0.5391817092895508
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6289582848548889
1,0,uh . and some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that .,15,0.5,0.5431694388389587
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4940173327922821
1,0,i guess it 's to the point where we need to decide about that .,15,0.5,0.5344273447990417
1,0,"okay , and we 're not yeah .",15,0.5,0.5319926142692566
1,0,well now that we 've decided on our,15,0.5,0.5332485437393188
1,0,are we gon na hav hav an are we d,15,0.5,0.5380364656448364
0,0,"have we decided on whether w we 're gon na s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we 're not we 're just gon na go for something",15,0.5,0.49679863452911377
1,0,"um it seems like we would n't wan na make it too busy and too sort of gaudy ,",15,0.5,0.5798833966255188
1,0,we 're,15,0.5,0.6019230484962463
1,0,maybe we can,15,0.5,0.512351930141449
0,0,"but um yeah , i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the r_r_ can be yellow , or something like that .",15,0.5,0.4828091561794281
1,0,"yeah . yeah . okay . okey-dokey . yeah , i do n't have any other questions on this . let 's move over to",15,0.5,0.6827902793884277
1,0,i i guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .,15,0.5,0.5194432139396667
1,0,"yeah , sure .",15,0.5,0.5300308465957642
0,0,"i mean , 'cause uh s so if we wan na have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button .",15,0.5,0.43335390090942383
1,0,.,15,0.5,0.5751392245292664
0,0,"but i think that should be i mean um , i can speak with the button department , but uh i think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating .",15,0.5,0.46240514516830444
0,0,"yeah , the button that just does that , yeah .",15,0.5,0.41208502650260925
1,0,so that should be simple .,15,0.5,0.5622899532318115
0,1,"hi kate . okay , carry on .",15,0.5,0.38702425360679626
1,0,just just carry on .,15,0.5,0.52776038646698
1,0,"alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . um our agenda should be um that we 're opening the meeting , i have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . um and we should each have a presentation to make . um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it 's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , um which i 'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . okay . um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we 'll come back to them in a minute after i take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . right um as we remember , i opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting 's minutes were reviewed and approved . um sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . and then steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . i think all of us agreed with those things . kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half pence cost . um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . um and the new requirements that it for be for t_v_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . um the corporate image . so we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the t_v_ , but it still should meet those parameters . um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . um at that point we agreed that sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . um and steph was gon na look at ec ergonomics . kate was gon na look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . and i was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?",15,0.5,0.5216048359870911
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6124354600906372
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5887371301651001
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4912460446357727
1,0,okay . right . so we 're ready to close that and go back to our that one . right . we 're up to the point of the go back . um the three presentations . so we 're going to pull the plug on me and turn to sarah . is that okay ? is that alright with everybody else ?,15,0.5,0.6340322494506836
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5764166116714478
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4733060896396637
1,0,"especially since kate asked to be last . sarah , i 'm sorry if i misspelled your name , i did n't know whether it was s_a_r_a_ or s_a_r_h_ .",15,0.5,0.5991731286048889
1,0,i respond to either .,15,0.5,0.5896966457366943

1,0,no worries .,15,0.5,0.585609495639801

1,0,"ah , there it is . ta-da .",15,0.5,0.545172929763794
1,0,"okay , first thing i want to address is um one of the points that florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that stephanie uh showed us and and they 're uh twenty to sixty euros , depending on uh branding .",15,0.5,0.5572029948234558
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5887311697006226
1,0,"some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . but i think that with the current um price that we 're searching for , we 're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market .",15,0.5,0.5682726502418518
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.24603313207626343

1,0,sorry .,15,0.5,0.5591377019882202
0,0,i 'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on .,15,0.5,0.40957385301589966
1,0,"i know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research ,",15,0.5,0.7197914719581604
0,0,"so you know , i 'm just gon na try to cloak it in really professional terms here . what 's hot , fruit and veg . spongy .",15,0.5,0.22450317442417145
1,0,"and this is all over the catwalks , paris , milan , and i 'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes .",15,0.5,0.7525039315223694

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.29451802372932434
1,0,"because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . and i think if we 're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . so . i also did a little research on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . fancy . functional is out . and f the fancy , and that 's exactly the term , i 'm i 'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . this is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . this is interesting , 'cause i think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what 's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . ease of use . again , pretty low , i mean it 's the top three , but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . so i think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves .",15,0.5,0.5145189762115479
1,0,i think that 's a good idea . do n't you ?,15,0.5,0.5099294185638428
0,0,"y yeah , you know",15,0.5,0.4132274389266968
1,0,"it sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone .",15,0.5,0.7185961604118347
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.38007238507270813
0,0,"exactly . exactly . i was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy .",15,0.5,0.4981730878353119

1,0,"they could be ini initially i thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we 'd just need to get reductionist on it .",15,0.5,0.5787993669509888
0,0,"they could be interchangeable , they 're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . so what we 're talking about is changing . this concept . everyone has a t_v_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit .",15,0.5,0.44259026646614075
1,0,"that 's what 's hot on the catwalks . so , this is my this is what i 'm thinking .",15,0.5,0.5139358639717102
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.34797582030296326
1,0,"uh-huh mm . in most families , do n't is n't the remote is a remote .",15,0.5,0.7291107177734375
1,0,"y yeah , but i think i think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote ,",15,0.5,0.5088061690330505
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.2877931296825409

0,0,"so when your dad 's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we 're gon na watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we 're gon na watch this .",15,0.5,0.35191431641578674
1,0,yeah . w and plus i think,15,0.5,0.5615140199661255
1,0,mm . well actually some households do have three and four t_v_s,15,0.5,0.5733720660209656
1,0,uh yeah .,15,0.5,0.626930832862854
1,0,"and they would have a remote for each one ,",15,0.5,0.5348429083824158
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5794507265090942
1,0,so .,15,0.5,0.5697540044784546
1,0,"yeah . so this is an idea and i i you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . so i really open this up to uh any other feedback . this spongy fruit and veg .",15,0.5,0.5164356231689453
1,0,"yeah , i i think we 're gon na have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .",15,0.5,0.7358810305595398
1,0,thanks . alright .,15,0.5,0.5784297585487366
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3922344148159027

1,0,is this to the market ?,15,0.5,0.5745425820350647
0,0,"yeah , i mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy ,",15,0.5,0.47421273589134216
0,0,"is spongiest , yeah .",15,0.5,0.47666221857070923
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6085917353630066
1,0,that would add,15,0.5,0.5154572129249573
1,0,i was thinking titanium myself .,15,0.5,0.552406370639801
0,0,"i was thinking titanium , i was thinking it 's just i have been influenced by pictures of ipods , and they 're also minimalist and shiny .",15,0.5,0.48400646448135376
1,0,"mm-hmm . they are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . i think many of us would associate those with fancy . something else we could do is uh call it something that 's fruit and veg oriented . we could call it uh the name .",15,0.5,0.5436961054801941
1,0,are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ?,15,0.5,0.5455306172370911
1,0,well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . so,15,0.5,0.5291275978088379
1,0,perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management,15,0.5,0.6066457629203796
1,0,"yeah , but it 's kind of pointless , is n't it ?",15,0.5,0.5955749750137329
0,0,and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product .,15,0.5,0.47564032673835754
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6548958420753479

1,0,let 's delegate .,15,0.5,0.5269181728363037
0,0,wo would that be agreeable ?,15,0.5,0.4832855761051178
1,0,and then we could keep it titanium .,15,0.5,0.605842649936676
0,0,"yeah . w w would it be helpful if um i described the components a bit , because i think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do .",15,0.5,0.4509870111942291
1,0,"yeah , maybe . or",15,0.5,0.6112003326416016
1,0,do you wan na be next or you want kate to go next ?,15,0.5,0.5554624795913696

1,0,"okay , we 'll move the",15,0.5,0.5868858098983765

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.39247679710388184
1,0,"um and the nearest we 've got to st to spongy there i guess is rubber , but um i 'm gon na come back to the advantages of titanium ,",15,0.5,0.6495009064674377
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3772745132446289
1,0,"and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but i think if we wan na use standard components , we 're gon na have difficulty with anything much beyond that .",15,0.5,0.6567831039428711
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4164327383041382
1,0,"okay , what does the interface look like ? um well push button , that 's that 's the one we 're all familiar with . um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push ,",15,0.5,0.5267881155014038
1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5064375400543213
1,0,"so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it 's it the technology is there . and we can also incorporate an l_c_d_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we 've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . if we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . all the other fancy interface designs go out the window , i 'm afraid . um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . if you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that 's what you need if you want the l_c_d_ display . and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . now i do n't know what that is , but i think they think it 's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , i have to say , but maybe you think that 's old technology .",15,0.5,0.5916571021080017
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.41141843795776367
1,0,"and well i i think we 've got two options . we can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , i think it , um wo n't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um that may or may not be a good thing .",15,0.5,0.5753363966941833
0,0,"sorry . um but it could have an l_c_d_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company 's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . so , thank you .",15,0.5,0.44722145795822144
1,0,that sounds good . any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference .,15,0.5,0.5279990434646606
1,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.5790435075759888
1,0,um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty ?,15,0.5,0.5077810287475586
1,0,"i 'm afraid i do n't have that information available . um manufacturing did n't actually give attach any prices to any of this , i 'm afraid .",15,0.5,0.5772347450256348
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.2921854257583618
1,0,"hmm . because , you know what , i 'm being quite serious when i say that that um the things i mentioned are hot . but i think the important thing might be to choose one .",15,0.5,0.6586077809333801
0,0,yeah mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4784153699874878
1,0,"you know , if if what you 're telling me is is um some of these things are n't just f are n't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , blackberry .",15,0.5,0.6043375134468079
0,0,"bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company ,",15,0.5,0.43659088015556335
1,0,that 's uh,15,0.5,0.6248960494995117
1,0,so what i had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .,15,0.5,0.6017471551895142
1,0,banana ?,15,0.5,0.5530741810798645

0,0,i 'm trying to streamline mine a little bit .,15,0.5,0.4211008846759796

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5643405914306641
1,0,we ca n't do anything fancier .,15,0.5,0.615239679813385

1,0,yes . there we go .,15,0.5,0.502404510974884
1,0,i do n't have it on mine though .,15,0.5,0.5391703248023987

0,0,should i do it again ?,15,0.5,0.49943748116493225
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5796363353729248
1,0,maybe .,15,0.5,0.5544600486755371
1,0,this time it should come up both .,15,0.5,0.5062185525894165
1,0,"right then . i do n't actually have a huge amount of different information then what kate says ,",15,0.5,0.511414647102356
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.39242491126060486
1,0,"just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including m_p_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things .",15,0.5,0.6470298767089844

1,0,"uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . uh i 've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel , which well , i could n't find a the picture of the ipod w only linked to a web browser , so i could n't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . it has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse .",15,0.5,0.6206756234169006

1,0,"what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , i mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , i was thinking , yellow and black , just because that 's the company 's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive .",15,0.5,0.5893579125404358

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6184846758842468

1,0,but,15,0.5,0.6558743715286255
0,0,it 's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology .,15,0.5,0.4247700572013855
1,0,to uh m make it .,15,0.5,0.5285536050796509
0,0,if i do n't think i can get it up on the screen . ah here we go . right .,15,0.5,0.45528796315193176
1,0,oh nice .,15,0.5,0.5845497250556946
1,0,"well ,",15,0.5,0.5735416412353516
1,0,um hmm .,15,0.5,0.5547250509262085
1,0,the ipod spinning wheel is uh really complicated .,15,0.5,0.514673113822937
1,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.5011518001556396
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5307151675224304
1,0,"it does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . what else have we got ?",15,0.5,0.587953507900238
0,0,mm . wow .,15,0.5,0.45893508195877075
1,0,"them , they 're terrible . but they all have this this feature of this uh it 's not quite a scroll wheel , but it 's a kind of selection in this circle ,",15,0.5,0.7145597338676453
0,0,it 's a selection wheel .,15,0.5,0.38268861174583435
1,0,which i think is a really good idea .,15,0.5,0.5246003270149231
0,0,"but we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper .",15,0.5,0.3824380934238434
1,0,"yeah , like up , down , left and right . which is good . and then and then yeah , so i mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it 's got your things like settings and contrast up and down .",15,0.5,0.5001696348190308
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6308831572532654
0,0,so all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .,15,0.5,0.4049948453903198
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5671533942222595
1,0,and that 's it .,15,0.5,0.510082483291626
1,0,in fact,15,0.5,0.6932836174964905
0,0,look at look at this one .,15,0.5,0.4620755910873413
0,0,oh that 's really nice .,15,0.5,0.4465618133544922
1,0,almost impossible to misplace or l or lose .,15,0.5,0.5264639258384705
1,0,do you think with um,15,0.5,0.563376784324646
1,0,might take up your whole living room .,15,0.5,0.5436105728149414
1,0,"it seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child 's remote . do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? and have it abstract . you know ,",15,0.5,0.5426070094108582
0,0,possibly .,15,0.5,0.4872249364852905
1,0,"we could call like a fruit name ,",15,0.5,0.5503332018852234
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3365572392940521
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.686077892780304
1,0,but it would be a little more abstract .,15,0.5,0.6129048466682434
0,0,mm . we we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you 'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy,15,0.5,0.44495120644569397
1,0,that also is possible .,15,0.5,0.5441778302192688
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5273820161819458
1,0,just,15,0.5,0.503585159778595
1,0,i 'm just just throwing out ideas .,15,0.5,0.6835808157920837
0,0,or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow .,15,0.5,0.44814884662628174
1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5352229475975037
1,0,yeah . i 'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so,15,0.5,0.5258755087852478
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5512744784355164
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5812482237815857
1,0,"uh just something else i need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? this is actually the volume up and down ,",15,0.5,0.6007060408592224
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5073269605636597

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5040972232818604
0,0,"which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow ,",15,0.5,0.4924236238002777
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5036349296569824
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6250878572463989
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4908320903778076
1,0,"but it 's actually the v_ to indicate that it 's the volume , so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .",15,0.5,0.5687376856803894
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6278265714645386
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.39908838272094727
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6474387049674988
1,0,nice . good point .,15,0.5,0.7562766075134277
0,0,"but we would n't have a specific volume up and down . if we 're having the scroll wheel , then it 's gon na double up as all the other up and down functions .",15,0.5,0.47283706068992615
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.3694344758987427
1,0,"but then , that 's complicated .",15,0.5,0.5954403281211853
0,0,"i wan na thank you all for all your presentations . we have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . um and i think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . so let 's mm . right . they want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we 've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . um this is where kate 's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by kate at this point .",15,0.5,0.4285849630832672
1,0,"the you were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you 'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . um or solar that you 'd have difficulty with it if it 's a dark day , that it 'll die on you , and no way to do it . that 's the day you wan na use the t_v_ .",15,0.5,0.6162696480751038
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.329061359167099
1,0,"um so what 's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ?",15,0.5,0.5757088661193848
0,0,oh unfortunately i do n't have costing information .,15,0.5,0.4603610038757324
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.425552099943161
1,0,"i i in terms of workability , i i think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic ,",15,0.5,0.6373407244682312
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.3113628327846527
1,0,but i 'm sorry i do n't figures on the difference in cost .,15,0.5,0.5869366526603699
0,0,what 's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ?,15,0.5,0.35442087054252625
1,0,"i 've used kinetic in terms of watches and it 's very very uh handy , you do n't even notice um that it 's there .",15,0.5,0.57585209608078
1,0,"it sounds great . i 've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . sounds like it could be g a really good economical",15,0.5,0.5552164316177368
0,0,it 's,15,0.5,0.4015611708164215
1,0,"it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient .",15,0.5,0.6535910367965698
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.36113443970680237
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4872511923313141
1,0,it could tie in with the fanciful design,15,0.5,0.6669209003448486
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.421829491853714
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6832197308540344
1,0,"as uh , you know ,",15,0.5,0.6264826655387878
1,0,"'cause it 's really a quite attractive thought ,",15,0.5,0.6596037149429321
0,0,"throw the banana , you know , just got ta keep it moving .",15,0.5,0.4815310537815094
0,0,"is n't it ? it 's like yeah ,",15,0.5,0.4724572002887726
1,0,so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it 's at all possible .,15,0.5,0.6479376554489136
1,0,a good selling point .,15,0.5,0.5167833566665649
0,0,be,15,0.5,0.3866623640060425
1,0,but it does depend how much i mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .,15,0.5,0.6234701871871948
0,0,it costs . mm .,15,0.5,0.31809931993484497
1,0,"and and how much you do have to keep it moving ,",15,0.5,0.5267649292945862
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5846785306930542
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4181276857852936
1,0,'cause i 'm conscious that watching t_v_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity .,15,0.5,0.5804076790809631
1,0,yeah . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6118695139884949
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.48133188486099243
1,1,"uh okay , well do you wan na um give us your presentation",15,0.5,0.5297362208366394
1,0,"okay , sure .",15,0.5,0.5847818851470947
1,0,and then then we can i do n't know,15,0.5,0.5496999621391296
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.47109878063201904
1,0,"um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we 're",15,0.5,0.6358470320701599
1,0,"yeah , it 's good well it 's good to get ideas out while they 're fresh in mind .",15,0.5,0.5206407904624939
1,0,"yeah , exactly , yeah .",15,0.5,0.647555947303772
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.42069241404533386
1,0,"oh it 's something that 's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that 's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well .",15,0.5,0.6312364935874939
0,0,not,15,0.5,0.4852387309074402
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.4385862648487091
1,0,"yeah . and not losing . and also it helps in terms of people not losing this ,",15,0.5,0.6211546063423157
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.44651445746421814
1,0,you know they they 're saying oh it 's i lose it in the couch .,15,0.5,0.6284904479980469
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5297738909721375
1,0,like we 're kind of what we 're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together,15,0.5,0.5456947088241577
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5767297148704529
1,0,that they,15,0.5,0.5337380170822144
1,0,"i reckon one problem with speech recognition is um i 've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one was n't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours .",15,0.5,0.5976560711860657
0,0,really ?,15,0.5,0.4246039390563965
1,0,channel up .,15,0.5,0.5275008082389832
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5945392847061157
1,0,"oh really , you 've seen one before .",15,0.5,0.7172349691390991
0,0,do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it 's worthwhile incorporating it though ?,15,0.5,0.46103453636169434
0,0,um i think it 'd probably quite expensive to put in .,15,0.5,0.37043634057044983
1,0,"sorry , do you mind passing me my notepad .",15,0.5,0.5208395719528198

0,0,"thanks . cool ,",15,0.5,0.4215840995311737
0,0,there you go .,15,0.5,0.4408143162727356
1,0,um . okay . um .,15,0.5,0.5239617228507996
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.6382285356521606
1,0,well this is just the working design um .,15,0.5,0.52371746301651
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5345609784126282
1,0,"well this is just what how i would go about it . um i guess i try to define like what we 're doing now , try to define what we 're trying to get done . um i think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is .",15,0.5,0.5545650720596313
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5980111360549927
1,0,"we 've used it , we 're familiar with it , but we 're we ca n't n we have n't narrowed down um exactly what the things we 're trying to fulfil , like besides the basics , i think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ?",15,0.5,0.5294788479804993
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5276744961738586
1,0,"um and i just the idea is just to get everybody to um i usually have a have have a design that 's there as a basic , so , you know , things that to start everything going . but i guess everybody does have some idea , so i do n't think um there 's a need for that . um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so i 'll go into the diagram first . it just explains how the process goes through , from a",15,0.5,0.5427485108375549

1,0,"from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . um okay , you need some power source . 'kay , a battery or something , to keep it going .",15,0.5,0.5955013632774353
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4849490523338318
1,0,um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies,15,0.5,0.5094815492630005
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.636852502822876
0,0,um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want .,15,0.5,0.4779921770095825
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4982811510562897
1,0,"like for example , voice recognition , right . that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that 's one perhaps constraint there . um th okay , the basic thing is there 's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever .",15,0.5,0.6313718557357788
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.29159700870513916
1,0,"you know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button a_ , so i will do something with button a_ . so maybe button a_ is the power button , okay .",15,0.5,0.634526789188385

1,0,"um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . um and i think that 's about it in terms of my design um . it 's fairly general , um and i guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you 're thinking ,",15,0.5,0.5644648671150208
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.44992613792419434
1,0,"like um voice recognition , right , um , if it 's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we do n't have enough power . so it 's not really a constraint in that sense ,",15,0.5,0.588640034198761
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.32977378368377686

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6386273503303528

0,1,"okay . um well , the function of a remote control , as what uh we 've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it 's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . and then functions for v_h_s_ , d_v_d_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . and enter would be for like , you know , the menus . and then other menus for d_v_ as well as t_v_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .",15,0.5,0.49077242612838745
0,0,"and we can decide if that 's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that 's something that would stay on the t_v_ itself , for example .",15,0.5,0.4324795603752136
1,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5622394680976868
0,0,"these are two examples . um and you can see on the left , it 's got a lot more buttons ,",15,0.5,0.4979073703289032
0,0,"and i do n't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . and then on the right , it 's a lot more simpler , it 's got volume , it 's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it 's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . so you have functions that are d uh duplicating .",15,0.5,0.396164208650589
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5185533165931702
0,0,"and you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . so that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . okay .",15,0.5,0.4856918454170227
1,0,ready .,15,0.5,0.6792768239974976
1,0,"and then lastly , it 's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? and what functions it needs to complete . uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that 's something that also has to be considered and it 's gon na be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place .",15,0.5,0.5080366730690002
0,0,so that 's it .,15,0.5,0.4308229088783264

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6397117376327515
1,0,and so here we go . uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote,15,0.5,0.589973509311676
0,0,designer .,15,0.5,0.46377795934677124
1,0,"and um it is to send messages of course to the t_v_ . it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . um . should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .",15,0.5,0.5772454142570496
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.4405169188976288
1,0,and she was challenged on that point,15,0.5,0.6107414364814758
1,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.5506077408790588
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5134232640266418
1,0,"but uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that 's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . uh and of course a circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider .",15,0.5,0.54736328125
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4680482745170593
1,0,"she would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . the marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that 's really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .",15,0.5,0.5457085967063904

1,0,"then and the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because i think i believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . so this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . so we have to take care of this fact also . then . uh it was function i want to go to .",15,0.5,0.648958146572113
0,0,oh you wan na go back ? just escape .,15,0.5,0.3112645447254181

0,0,"ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales .",15,0.5,0.43271395564079285
0,0,okay . so these percentages are are what ?,15,0.5,0.37953731417655945
0,0,"yeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , i can open it in another way .",15,0.5,0.49291402101516724
0,0,okay . speech recognition .,15,0.5,0.42410269379615784
0,0,"uh , yes . if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control .",15,0.5,0.44150978326797485
0,0,"so we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five ,",15,0.5,0.4830392301082611
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.33176010847091675
1,0,and i uh and i think that most of the users of the rem uh t_v_ are belong to this age group . so we should look,15,0.5,0.7299143671989441
1,0,hmm . we 're als we we 're looking at who buys it as well .,15,0.5,0.5033572316169739
1,0,"yeah . we can look at that that factor also , so yes .",15,0.5,0.6795798540115356
0,0,"uh , which i think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of .",15,0.5,0.40773212909698486

0,0,fifteen to twe,15,0.5,0.38936978578567505
1,0,yes . i think so . uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market .,15,0.5,0.5118204355239868
1,0,"they find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . so it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . they need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls .",15,0.5,0.535045325756073
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.41436123847961426

1,0,"so um i looked at existing designs and also um the information that raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . um and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our t_v_ i think .",15,0.5,0.5120155215263367

0,0,organic .,15,0.5,0.4382631778717041

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5293852686882019
0,0,so i think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks .,15,0.5,0.41551870107650757

1,0,"so maybe we forget about that . it 's for one t_v_ oh right okay , sure . and so the last thing i thought w which i quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark",15,0.5,0.57795649766922

1,0,and i jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .,15,0.5,0.5220285654067993
0,0,let 's remember that .,15,0.5,0.42510324716567993
1,0,"um so raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and um he also mentioned that uh the current products do n't always match users ' operating behaviour . um , a lot of the buttons are n't used , and uh he mentioned that they 're not fun to use . and uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote ,",15,0.5,0.6442253589630127
0,0,"there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it 'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it 'll beep back and say you know oh here i am or something of this sort .",15,0.5,0.4321022927761078
1,0,mm-hmm . but sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you 're likely to get it beeping back at you .,15,0.5,0.6123026013374329
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5294854044914246
1,0,"oh yeah , yeah , that 's true .",15,0.5,0.5803334712982178
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5975905656814575
0,0,well maybe you could have a um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . um .,15,0.5,0.4562148153781891
1,0,sorry i did n't mean to derail you there .,15,0.5,0.7118639945983887
0,0,"yeah well tha that 's uh for later down the road um , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , um and not computery ,",15,0.5,0.4297247529029846
1,0,"right , so more low tech and not too many buttons .",15,0.5,0.5488566160202026
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.43374428153038025
1,0,so i took these all into consideration and also i have some limitations from the boss .,15,0.5,0.5787850618362427
0,0,"right um , and practical limitations which i kinda threw out the window .",15,0.5,0.49521470069885254
1,0,"and so i did a little research and unfortunately all i had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we 've made before ,",15,0.5,0.5703615546226501
0,0,"which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains or uh or a high speed train .",15,0.5,0.4844033122062683
1,0,ah is that what that is ?,15,0.5,0.5045070648193359
1,0,right and having personally worked with all these products uh i have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these .,15,0.5,0.5387359857559204
1,0,"well that 's cool . if you if you can build space craft you 'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5406854152679443
1,0,"right . so ,",15,0.5,0.5049211978912354
1,0,yeah sure .,15,0.5,0.5863208770751953
1,0,"i figured , just put 'em all together .",15,0.5,0.5868923664093018
1,0,"you got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your t_v_ , and um",15,0.5,0.6091402769088745
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4451197683811188
0,0,"as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . give it one button",15,0.5,0.46629905700683594
1,0,"and and it 's a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us",15,0.5,0.7174690961837769
0,0,i i 'm not quite sure what the the function is there but,15,0.5,0.4118456244468689
1,0,right okay .,15,0.5,0.5164082050323486
0,0,well i like that design .,15,0.5,0.48270824551582336
0,0,yeah it 's a g i mean you could have a you know a,15,0.5,0.49863824248313904
1,0,"is that just switches on the speech recognition and it 's entirely speech operated , is it ?",15,0.5,0.6072220206260681
0,0,"right . so i think i i missed the budget thing ,",15,0.5,0.40721365809440613
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6806141138076782
0,0,it was fifty million euros ?,15,0.5,0.4886687099933624
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4283340871334076
1,0,and we got ta sell twenty five of them ? right . okay .,15,0.5,0.6117216944694519
0,0,"yeah , not a problem .",15,0.5,0.4299899637699127
1,0,fifty million was uh prof,15,0.5,0.7535741329193115
1,0,ah now it 's fif fifty million euros we 've got ta uh we 've g,15,0.5,0.6208686232566833
0,0,as a profit .,15,0.5,0.37986642122268677
0,0,"oh okay , so i i mixed those numbers .",15,0.5,0.40544459223747253
1,0,"got ta make profit , so we 're making that at twelve and a half euros a time .",15,0.5,0.6639891266822815
0,0,"okay . well i guess more realistically then , we need a product that 's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic uh , you know , um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less .",15,0.5,0.3837555944919586
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.42404478788375854
1,0,an energy source which 'd probably just be uh your regular batteries,15,0.5,0.5153403878211975
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5397922396659851
0,0,"um , we do n't wan na have it",15,0.5,0.49316713213920593
1,0,would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? is that is that gon na mark up a lot ?,15,0.5,0.5926985740661621
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.4584353268146515
1,0,"or a little base station or something , .",15,0.5,0.5790479183197021
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5084335803985596
0,0,"yeah , yeah , we could do that too . um , i had n't thought of that . yeah .",15,0.5,0.48161476850509644
1,0,"that might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we do n't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it 's more , it 's that 's cheaper to just provide batteries .",15,0.5,0.6599922180175781
0,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.40770015120506287
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5812659859657288
0,0,"i mean if you think about these base stations now it 's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it ,",15,0.5,0.46912091970443726
1,0,"a battery in it , kinda .",15,0.5,0.7802491188049316
0,0,so i do n't think it 'd up up the price that much .,15,0.5,0.35921791195869446
0,0,"right , so so",15,0.5,0.37496650218963623
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6153145432472229
0,0,the unirs the user interface,15,0.5,0.4469316303730011
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.45605984330177307
1,0,"uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we 're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power",15,0.5,0.5266550183296204
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4584499001502991
0,0,behind our product .,15,0.5,0.48169684410095215
1,0,"um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you do n't have to worry about .",15,0.5,0.5474011301994324
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6112298369407654
0,0,"um so here 's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me .",15,0.5,0.44617992639541626
1,0,"um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it 's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . and i suppose you all know how it works because we 've all used it and we would n't be in a company designing remote controls if we did n't know what they were so uh personal preferences , i think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it 's not blasting .",15,0.5,0.5922515392303467
0,0,mm . mm that 's a good idea actually i like the programmable options .,15,0.5,0.3557906448841095
0,0,"yeah , me too .",15,0.5,0.4319850206375122
0,0,"oh okay . and the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort",15,0.5,0.48096704483032227
1,0,and it 's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .,15,0.5,0.557245135307312
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.37565433979034424
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.39970362186431885
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6074022650718689
1,0,that 's all i got .,15,0.5,0.6801268458366394
1,0,"'kay , thank you very much , um i 'll take that back .",15,0.5,0.5611590147018433
0,1,"uh it fell off . one , two , three , four , yeah , we 're ready . okay . welcome to this second meeting . um it 's now quarter after twelve and we 're given forty minutes um for this meeting . this is a meeting on functional design . um and i wan na welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . um i did took the minutes from the first meeting and i 'll show them to you in a moment . um i know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , i thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there 's i happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . okay ? is this ap everybody agree with this ?",15,0.5,0.458896666765213
1,0,oops .,15,0.5,0.5604550838470459
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5095706582069397
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.6566219329833984
1,0,"okay . um and after the meeting there 'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting . and go to that one . um as you can see it was this earlier today . um kate , steph , sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . i opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese . and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting anybody have any questions on those minutes ? are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 'kay .",15,0.5,0.5744600892066956
1,0,"uh i think so ,",15,0.5,0.5339561104774475
1,0,did i miss something ?,15,0.5,0.7202216982841492
0,0,we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well .,15,0.5,0.49694809317588806
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4193289279937744
1,0,"yeah . i 'm afraid i incorporated that when i said who was present , but yes , we did ,",15,0.5,0.5085375905036926
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5876715183258057
0,0,"and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures ,",15,0.5,0.43299922347068787
1,0,"okay , i accept the minutes .",15,0.5,0.6361475586891174
1,0,but i did n't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . so um as a group i think we 've are they 're accepting the minutes . and uh okay .,15,0.5,0.5510148406028748
1,0,is that what we 're supposed to say ?,15,0.5,0.5274348258972168
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6611467599868774
0,1,"okay , all set ? welcome to the conceptual design meeting .",15,0.5,0.49171286821365356
1,0,"uh , okay .",15,0.5,0.6045666933059692
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.6210286617279053
1,0,"the agenda . the opening . i 'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . so um , who wants to start off ? technical uh designer again ?",15,0.5,0.5726631879806519
0,0,again .,15,0.5,0.4941757023334503
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5834211111068726
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.46191346645355225
1,0,"uh , yeah . uh , before we begin it , i want to say i 've i 've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they 're still not uh quite okay . it uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other .",15,0.5,0.6197253465652466
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5576757192611694
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.456035852432251
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4846039116382599
1,0,"but uh , from now on i wo n't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard .",15,0.5,0.5974153280258179
1,0,"uh , may be better , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5425470471382141
1,0,keyboard work . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6699025630950928
1,0,i think it will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes .,15,0.5,0.5075594782829285
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5611752271652222
1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.6032746434211731
1,0,"okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it 's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . we have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls . um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah , it feels uh good in your hand .",15,0.5,0.5804543495178223
0,0,"mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . uh i 've got a uh email from the possibilities of real reaction . um uh they 're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . mm it 's okay . yeah . i when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . uh um",15,0.5,0.3963148593902588
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.4224710166454315
1,0,"the energy source , uh i 've got a lot of possibilities for that too . um , uh the basic battery , which i thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah , kinetic uh energy . also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you do n't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls .",15,0.5,0.560808002948761
0,0,"um uh also the case material , uh i think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird .",15,0.5,0.42247000336647034
0,0,"oh titanium is probably trendy , i think . .",15,0.5,0.495743989944458
1,0,"that 's true , i guess . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5951516032218933
0,0,"well , maybe a little bit expensive .",15,0.5,0.4456823468208313
1,0,i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.6019044518470764
1,0,"uh , they do n't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium .",15,0.5,0.5360581278800964
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.45281580090522766
0,0,"um the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . mm , i 've told about uh the three first points . mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the led transmitter uh transmitter . uh , it 's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . um , another possibility . i uh yeah , i looked up on was uh the l_c_d_ displays . could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it 's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five euros .",15,0.5,0.3765393793582916
1,0,twelve and a half . actually,15,0.5,0.620427131652832

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6161168217658997
1,0,"yeah , production cost .",15,0.5,0.5386757254600525
0,0,i th i got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one .,15,0.5,0.4292545020580292
1,0,"you see uh a covers , which can be",15,0.5,0.6202532649040222
0,0,"what are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so",15,0.5,0.4611714482307434
1,0,"um , i do n't know . um",15,0.5,0.5504815578460693
1,0,but it 's actually kind of uh,15,0.5,0.5512168407440186
1,0,i,15,0.5,0.6187908053398132
0,0,"well , it resembles the design i had in mind for this proj",15,0.5,0.4851934313774109
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.6910185217857361
1,0,you know the the cartoonish alessi kind of design .,15,0.5,0.6142286062240601
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.495343953371048
1,0,"yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh",15,0.5,0.6338022947311401
0,0,and we can we can steal their ideas .,15,0.5,0.40698572993278503
1,0,maybe a kind of uh whole uh um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls .,15,0.5,0.5709535479545593
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.36242401599884033
1,0,maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh with a huge variety of uh,15,0.5,0.5500696301460266
1,0,"well , it 's a possibility , too .",15,0.5,0.5140039920806885
1,0,uh house uh stuff .,15,0.5,0.6080999374389648
0,0,different colours also .,15,0.5,0.4759121239185333
1,0,"like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style , but",15,0.5,0.6360979676246643

1,0,"and uh i also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . um if i 'm right , there are three presentations , i guess each one of you has prepared one ? good .",15,0.5,0.5751060843467712
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5831729769706726
1,0,"and um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you have n't heard about them yet . and then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . but i think we will need it . um well i do n't know who wants to go first with his presentation .",15,0.5,0.5285707712173462

1,0,so you can adjust it .,15,0.5,0.5204436779022217
0,0,"so . huh ? okay , um",15,0.5,0.47866159677505493

0,0,"i_e_ e_i_e_ , okay . thank you .",15,0.5,0.4956549406051636
0,0,"okay , um i wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . it 's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . um well so it basically works uh as i uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . uh when you press a button , uh that 's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a",15,0.5,0.37621018290519714

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6026067137718201
1,0,"okay . and that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . that 's basically uh how it works . um the findings uh uh that i found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it 's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh and chips .",15,0.5,0.5876669883728027
1,0,"uh and the technology 's already available , we do n't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . uh i made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works .",15,0.5,0.5796509981155396
0,0,oh right .,15,0.5,0.40408846735954285
1,0,animation .,15,0.5,0.5384949445724487
1,0,we tel,15,0.5,0.508490800857544
1,0,there is something turning .,15,0.5,0.563450276851654
0,0,there .,15,0.5,0.4688226580619812
1,0,"yeah , it 's a little bug it 's in the in the smart board .",15,0.5,0.53803950548172
1,0,okay . uh well,15,0.5,0.5286043286323547
1,0,"the sub-component , i suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it 's the button . uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh li uh a d ad uh electronic uh",15,0.5,0.5790175199508667
1,0,infrared light .,15,0.5,0.534709632396698
1,0,"yes , uh , okay . um w after it 's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set . okay . s uh i wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you do n't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it 's it 's very light to uh to make uh to use it . uh i personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . but i suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too .",15,0.5,0.5436529517173767
1,0,"yeah , i 've got it there too .",15,0.5,0.6616528630256653
1,0,"and it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged ,",15,0.5,0.5086313486099243
0,0,uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . and uh well as i said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs .,15,0.5,0.49989476799964905
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6299359202384949

1,0,smoking .,15,0.5,0.5149245262145996
1,0,"well uh , my name 's , and i looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . uh i did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that i found . um well what i found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . and this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play c_d_ if you use it your c_d_ player the remote control will that one . there are some uh examples of remote controls . you can see they are very different . the one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . and the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . and uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . um i guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they do n't think it 's usable they wo n't uh buy it . a lot of buttons they may think from i do n't need s as much as that . uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . but uh keep in mind the new functions of t_v_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? because all the t_v_s will have them . or because of only a few and is n't really necessary . and then uh make it i would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . if you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . the shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you do n't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . and it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . and that is my presentation .",15,0.5,0.6763779520988464
0,0,"okay , thank you .",15,0.5,0.364765465259552

0,0,you must still have it open .,15,0.5,0.43799740076065063
1,0,"kijke 'kay , so . we 're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just yeah , and the users , actually .",15,0.5,0.5319976806640625
1,0,"the methods i i prefer is we 're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? and then tho that section we 're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . okay . some data . younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like l_c_d_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . the elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that 's two fifth , of the market share in that area . goed so .",15,0.5,0.5160833597183228
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.17849907279014587
1,0,'kay . findings . fifty percent of the users lose their remote often .,15,0.5,0.7440130114555359
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.2966567575931549
1,0,"so we do n't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you do n't lose it that much anymore . seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly ,",15,0.5,0.6694164276123047
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.23561811447143555
1,0,"and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or should n't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . next . important issues about the remote . i think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . and have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . it has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . my colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off",15,0.5,0.5714856386184692
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3969021737575531
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4531182050704956
1,0,or would be s uh senden,15,0.5,0.6295195817947388
1,0,"okay . so uh if that 's k uh if that 's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . buttons . like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in l_c_d_ screen . l_c_d_ screen is easy because we have the l_c_d_ screen , we have the various options . put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . and you do n't see the buttons . so l_c_d_ screens should be easy , but an l_c_d_ screen , the problem with the l_ sc l_c_d_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years do n't use the l_c_d_ screen a lot . so we have to that keep that in mind that if you 're going to implement l_c_d_ screen , you do n't have to make it that hard to learn or to use .",15,0.5,0.5403249859809875
1,0,uh l_c_d_ screen as in uh touch screen ?,15,0.5,0.5662805438041687
1,0,"yeah , touch screen , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5605863332748413
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.43922698497772217
1,0,"the last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . and the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control .",15,0.5,0.6935549974441528

0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.4917152523994446
1,0,"so we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . and on my personal preferences , i do n't have any mo more time to come with that ,",15,0.5,0.6353846788406372
0,0,"but like i said , l_c_d_ screen is easily to use",15,0.5,0.39251944422721863
0,0,"because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . and it should be easy to use . especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . and that is it .",15,0.5,0.47089883685112

0,0,"well i started making an overview for myself , um what i had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step i have a s specific task to perform or whatever .",15,0.5,0.46852949261665344
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.49216338992118835
1,0,"so i had to uh , i dunno , make an overview for myself about what i have to do ,",15,0.5,0.5420178771018982
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4711380898952484
1,0,and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how i have to fill it .,15,0.5,0.599700391292572
1,0,mm-hmm . and do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?,15,0.5,0.5325024127960205
1,0,"well i started i started with the first phase , i think was the functional .",15,0.5,0.5610599517822266
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6280030012130737
1,0,"and uh let 's see i had to focus on the working design , which you said .",15,0.5,0.5109150409698486
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.567210853099823
0,0,"how does the apparatus work ? and well i basically had two points . uh according to the coffee uh machine example , i have batteries to supply energy ,",15,0.5,0.4599955677986145
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5848249197006226
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6751723289489746
0,0,and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the t_v_ .,15,0.5,0.35568732023239136
1,0,mm-hmm . okay .,15,0.5,0.5004174113273621
1,0,and that 's basically all i have so far .,15,0.5,0.5483528971672058
1,0,yeah i got another point . it uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the t_v_ apparatus or stereo .,15,0.5,0.5391963720321655
1,0,yeah . wireless uh huh .,15,0.5,0.5861031413078308
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.543550431728363

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.609943687915802
1,0,so that 's very common .,15,0.5,0.5542272925376892
1,0,uh it 's uh some buttons for for the on off function . you d you already told that . and for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume . that are the the basic options for a remote control .,15,0.5,0.5623925924301147
1,0,"yeah . yeah i kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions ,",15,0.5,0.5173208117485046
1,0,"okay , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5701086521148682
1,0,"'cause i was n't thinking yet about that . i mean , you wan na ch ch flip the channel",15,0.5,0.5122023224830627
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6498980522155762
1,0,but you might wan na use teletext also .,15,0.5,0.5639649629592896
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.3165489435195923

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5561204552650452
1,0,uh and what did the marketing expert do ?,15,0.5,0.673808753490448
1,0,"uh well from a marketing uh perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements .",15,0.5,0.5033653378486633
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5413910746574402
1,0,um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? so there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market .,15,0.5,0.5646491646766663
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5372095704078674
0,0,"i mean , what functions do they have .",15,0.5,0.49080026149749756
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4190102219581604

1,0,"uh , okay .",15,0.5,0.6045666933059692
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.6210286617279053
1,0,"the agenda . the opening . i 'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . so um , who wants to start off ? technical uh designer again ?",15,0.5,0.5726631879806519
0,0,again .,15,0.5,0.4941757023334503

1,0,"uh , yeah . uh , before we begin it , i want to say i 've i 've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they 're still not uh quite okay . it uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other .",15,0.5,0.6197253465652466
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5576757192611694

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4846039116382599
1,0,"but uh , from now on i wo n't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard .",15,0.5,0.5974153280258179
1,0,"uh , may be better , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5425470471382141
1,0,keyboard work . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6699025630950928
1,0,i think it will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes .,15,0.5,0.5075594782829285
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5611752271652222
1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.603258490562439
1,0,"okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it 's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . we have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls . um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah , it feels uh good in your hand .",15,0.5,0.5804557204246521
0,0,"mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . uh i 've got a uh email from the possibilities of real reaction . um uh they 're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . mm it 's okay . yeah . i when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . uh um",15,0.5,0.3963001072406769
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.42247113585472107
1,0,"the energy source , uh i 've got a lot of possibilities for that too . um , uh the basic battery , which i thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah , kinetic uh energy . also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you do n't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls .",15,0.5,0.5608078837394714
0,0,"um uh also the case material , uh i think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird .",15,0.5,0.42247021198272705
0,0,"oh titanium is probably trendy , i think . .",15,0.5,0.495743989944458
1,0,"that 's true , i guess . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5951516032218933
0,0,"well , maybe a little bit expensive .",15,0.5,0.4456823468208313
1,0,i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.6019044518470764
1,0,"uh , they do n't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium .",15,0.5,0.5360581278800964
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.452817440032959
0,0,"um the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . mm , i 've told about uh the three first points . mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the led transmitter uh transmitter . uh , it 's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . um , another possibility . i uh yeah , i looked up on was uh the l_c_d_ displays . could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it 's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five euros .",15,0.5,0.3765348196029663
1,0,twelve and a half . actually,15,0.5,0.6204313635826111

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6161168217658997
1,0,"yeah , production cost .",15,0.5,0.5386756658554077
0,0,i th i got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one .,15,0.5,0.4292545020580292
1,0,"you see uh a covers , which can be",15,0.5,0.6202532649040222
0,0,"what are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so",15,0.5,0.4611715078353882
1,0,"um , i do n't know . um",15,0.5,0.5504815578460693
1,0,but it 's actually kind of uh,15,0.5,0.5512168407440186
1,0,i,15,0.5,0.6187908053398132
0,0,"well , it resembles the design i had in mind for this proj",15,0.5,0.4851934313774109
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.6910185217857361
1,0,you know the the cartoonish alessi kind of design .,15,0.5,0.6142286062240601
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.495343953371048
1,0,"yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh",15,0.5,0.6338022947311401
0,0,and we can we can steal their ideas .,15,0.5,0.40698590874671936
1,0,maybe a kind of uh whole uh um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls .,15,0.5,0.5709534883499146
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.36242416501045227
1,0,maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh with a huge variety of uh,15,0.5,0.5500696301460266
1,0,"well , it 's a possibility , too .",15,0.5,0.5140039920806885
1,0,uh house uh stuff .,15,0.5,0.6080999374389648
0,0,different colours also .,15,0.5,0.4759121239185333

1,0,"well , i shall go to the next slide . um",15,0.5,0.6293035745620728
1,0,"um , i still do n't have any information about user requirements .",15,0.5,0.6496080160140991
1,0,i was thinking about just uh the basic functions and i got uh,15,0.5,0.558051347732544
0,0,"oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . did n't we ?",15,0.5,0.48378804326057434
1,0,"yeah , but but then wh i do n't know when there are new user requirements .",15,0.5,0.6310939788818359
1,0,"oh , okay . well , tha i did n't receive any new requirements or somethi",15,0.5,0.5570593476295471

1,0,just,15,0.5,0.5146068334579468
1,0,nothing .,15,0.5,0.6930862069129944
1,0,"no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only .",15,0.5,0.5345311164855957
0,0,"well , i have here a couple of basic functions i could think of .",15,0.5,0.37437674403190613
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5144639611244202
0,0,"i dunno if they 're maybe a little bit more , but",15,0.5,0.4633011221885681
1,0,well we maybe we can think of that later . w just,15,0.5,0.6108679175376892
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6102791428565979
1,0,these are the ones you already summed up in the,15,0.5,0.5571126937866211
0,0,"yeah , i i uh well , i pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier .",15,0.5,0.3703486919403076
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6151694059371948
1,0,"um another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side . um , i do n't know what costs of it . uh , i 've no idea about it . uh , i was also looking for what you said , for i got an email uh uh about uh l_c_d_ in in in front of the remote control . i do n't know if that 's a good idea , or maybe it 's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . production .",15,0.5,0.5511022806167603
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5020169615745544
1,0,if we got already uh something like a base .,15,0.5,0.6023756861686707
0,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.4682841897010803
1,0,that might get redundant also maybe . i do n't know what kind of information it would,15,0.5,0.5985861420631409
1,0,"yeah , i do n't know . i d i uh ju i was just thinking about it . then i got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . but",15,0.5,0.5107579231262207
1,0,mm yeah .,15,0.5,0.5252702236175537
0,0,"yeah . yeah , it 's okay .",15,0.5,0.48070427775382996
0,0,maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control .,15,0.5,0.47406014800071716
1,0,the remote control .,15,0.5,0.5148789882659912
0,0,then you,15,0.5,0.4448818266391754
0,0,a little uh too a little bit,15,0.5,0.3803187310695648
1,0,and then you 've got a flag s very big r_c_ . yeah .,15,0.5,0.70440673828125
1,0,okay . that 's not it was not a good idea .,15,0.5,0.6489179134368896
0,0,"a little bit too big , i think . exactly .",15,0.5,0.34606605768203735
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.7607438564300537
0,0,"um , yeah . well , the functions are are not more to discuss , i think .",15,0.5,0.49257758259773254
0,0,no . no .,15,0.5,0.32107701897621155
1,0,it 's it 's just the base things we already discussed that the no v_c_r_ or that kind of,15,0.5,0.6528806686401367
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.39885395765304565
1,0,"uh , so that 's very easy . um",15,0.5,0.5294132828712463
0,0,but you do mention the next and previous uh button .,15,0.5,0.4825476408004761
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.596416175365448
1,0,"well , that 's next channel . i mean next channel .",15,0.5,0.5681555867195129
1,0,"next channel , previous channel .",15,0.5,0.5287837386131287
1,0,"oh , okay , o okay okay .",15,0.5,0.5596559643745422
1,0,"uh um oh , i i got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base .",15,0.5,0.5528665781021118
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.43844515085220337
0,0,"so , it 's uh just an idea . and i um uh thinked of the button sizes and i 'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small",15,0.5,0.418768972158432
1,0,but you 're the expert .,15,0.5,0.7013058066368103
0,0,i think it depends on the function .,15,0.5,0.42496463656425476
0,0,"well , i 'm not a e i 'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness .",15,0.5,0.47548848390579224
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.47855785489082336
0,0,maybe it,15,0.5,0.45962950587272644
1,0,"well , if you save uh perhaps uh s tiny buttons are n't user-friendly , then we would n't im implement that of course .",15,0.5,0.5482480525970459
0,0,well uh,15,0.5,0.39470160007476807
1,0,"okay , that 's your point . um , yeah . yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.5533362627029419
1,0,"yeah , i 've nothing to s",15,0.5,0.6902861595153809
0,0,"well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger .",15,0.5,0.45569077134132385
1,0,"oh , that 's right .",15,0.5,0.5284972786903381

1,0,"yeah , that groups .",15,0.5,0.647598147392273

1,0,"because that 's the mo it it you know , it 's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ? it puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t",15,0.5,0.5987638235092163
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.45972058176994324
1,0,true . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5746583342552185
1,0,those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control .,15,0.5,0.5651505589485168
0,0,"yeah . and you want to acc accentuate that , you know .",15,0.5,0.41952916979789734
1,0,you did the research .,15,0.5,0.6273373365402222

1,0,"my name is xavier juergens , i 'm the industrial designer , and there are three main questions that i have to find an answer to today . first one is uh what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is uh the apparatus made of ,",15,0.5,0.5827507972717285
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4438115358352661
1,0,and the third is what should it look like .,15,0.5,0.5681651830673218
1,0,what should it look like ? okay .,15,0.5,0.5237549543380737
1,1,"okay , first thing i want to address is um one of the points that florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that stephanie uh showed us and and they 're uh twenty to sixty euros , depending on uh branding .",15,0.5,0.5633785128593445
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5887447595596313

0,0,i 'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on .,15,0.5,0.40957385301589966
1,0,"i know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research ,",15,0.5,0.7197914719581604
0,0,"so you know , i 'm just gon na try to cloak it in really professional terms here . what 's hot , fruit and veg . spongy .",15,0.5,0.22450317442417145
1,0,"and this is all over the catwalks , paris , milan , and i 'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes .",15,0.5,0.7525042295455933

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.2945077121257782
1,0,"because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . and i think if we 're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . so . i also did a little research on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . fancy . functional is out . and f the fancy , and that 's exactly the term , i 'm i 'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . this is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . this is interesting , 'cause i think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what 's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . ease of use . again , pretty low , i mean it 's the top three , but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . so i think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves .",15,0.5,0.5824265480041504
0,0,i think that 's a good idea . do n't you ?,15,0.5,0.48264992237091064
0,0,"y yeah , you know",15,0.5,0.4132274091243744
1,0,"it sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone .",15,0.5,0.7185961604118347
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.38007238507270813
0,0,"exactly . exactly . i was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy .",15,0.5,0.49817314743995667
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.48505526781082153
1,0,"they could be ini initially i thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we 'd just need to get reductionist on it .",15,0.5,0.5787916779518127
0,0,"they could be interchangeable , they 're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . so what we 're talking about is changing . this concept . everyone has a t_v_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit .",15,0.5,0.4426096975803375
1,0,"that 's what 's hot on the catwalks . so , this is my this is what i 'm thinking .",15,0.5,0.5139358639717102
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.34797582030296326
1,0,"uh-huh mm . in most families , do n't is n't the remote is a remote .",15,0.5,0.7291108965873718
1,0,"y yeah , but i think i think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote ,",15,0.5,0.5088059306144714
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.2877933979034424
1,0,"but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , i 'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .",15,0.5,0.6772910356521606
0,0,"so when your dad 's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we 're gon na watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we 're gon na watch this .",15,0.5,0.35191431641578674
1,0,yeah . w and plus i think,15,0.5,0.5615140199661255
1,0,mm . well actually some households do have three and four t_v_s,15,0.5,0.5733720660209656
1,0,uh yeah .,15,0.5,0.626930832862854
1,0,"and they would have a remote for each one ,",15,0.5,0.5348429083824158
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5794507265090942
1,0,so .,15,0.5,0.5697540044784546
1,0,"yeah . so this is an idea and i i you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . so i really open this up to uh any other feedback . this spongy fruit and veg .",15,0.5,0.5164356231689453
1,0,"yeah , i i think we 're gon na have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .",15,0.5,0.7358810901641846
1,0,thanks . alright .,15,0.5,0.5784297585487366
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.39223435521125793
0,0,"spongy is gon na be difficult , i 'm afraid .",15,0.5,0.49103888869285583
1,0,"yep . and as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we 're gon na have lots of different interchangeable components .",15,0.5,0.6657976508140564
1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5165131092071533
1,0,"i i just have my ear to the market , guys .",15,0.5,0.5935105085372925
1,0,is this to the market ?,15,0.5,0.574542760848999
0,0,"yeah , i mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy ,",15,0.5,0.4742125868797302
0,0,"is spongiest , yeah .",15,0.5,0.47666221857070923
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6085917353630066
1,0,that would add,15,0.5,0.5154572129249573
1,0,i was thinking titanium myself .,15,0.5,0.5524062514305115
0,0,"i was thinking titanium , i was thinking it 's just i have been influenced by pictures of ipods , and they 're also minimalist and shiny .",15,0.5,0.43069988489151
0,0,"mm-hmm . they are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . i think many of us would associate those with fancy . something else we could do is uh call it something that 's fruit and veg oriented . we could call it uh the name .",15,0.5,0.44516268372535706
1,0,are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ?,15,0.5,0.5455304384231567
1,0,well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . so,15,0.5,0.5291275978088379
1,0,perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management,15,0.5,0.6066457629203796
1,0,"yeah , but it 's kind of pointless , is n't it ?",15,0.5,0.5955749154090881
0,0,and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product .,15,0.5,0.4756403863430023
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6548958420753479
1,0,"that , you know , that might be",15,0.5,0.5570351481437683
1,0,let 's delegate .,15,0.5,0.5269181728363037
0,0,wo would that be agreeable ?,15,0.5,0.4832855761051178
1,0,and then we could keep it titanium .,15,0.5,0.6059884428977966
0,0,"yeah . w w would it be helpful if um i described the components a bit , because i think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do .",15,0.5,0.4510018825531006
1,0,"yeah , maybe . or",15,0.5,0.6113327145576477
1,0,do you wan na be next or you want kate to go next ?,15,0.5,0.5554624795913696
1,0,i think possibly it might be more useful if kate went next .,15,0.5,0.5242481827735901
1,0,"okay , we 'll move the",15,0.5,0.5868858098983765
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.6627282500267029
1,0,"you can even have them in different flavours as well . so that if you just wan na sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour ,",15,0.5,0.5013697743415833
0,0,yeah . or s or smelly . scratchy,15,0.5,0.3940633237361908
1,0,yeah . scratch and sniff .,15,0.5,0.5950515270233154
1,0,uh well i was really thinking a lot about the i_ uh the imac kind of gel gem tone .,15,0.5,0.6146811842918396
1,0,"right , well",15,0.5,0.6345281600952148
1,0,"it 's hot on the streets , guys .",15,0.5,0.5483763217926025
1,0,i i i think some of this um,15,0.5,0.5132141709327698
1,1,we have a financial aspect to this project . um we can sell them at twenty five euros . uh the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million euros . uh that 's quite a big amount of money . and the production cost should be the half of the selling price . okay,15,0.5,0.5574882626533508
0,0,so we have to s,15,0.5,0.38760149478912354
0,0,now it 's time for some discussion .,15,0.5,0.4486304223537445
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5079520344734192
1,0,uh,15,0.5,0.5439642071723938
1,0,what uh what uh do you want to discuss ?,15,0.5,0.5120007395744324
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5536457300186157
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6103971004486084
1,0,we should get started .,15,0.5,0.6021009087562561
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.3986365795135498
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6890755295753479

1,0,okay . great .,15,0.5,0.6279244422912598

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6095177531242371
1,0,okay so the um uh this industrati industrial designer should produce a working design . am i correct ?,15,0.5,0.55275559425354
1,0,true .,15,0.5,0.6287845373153687
1,0,okay . uh the user interface designer should specify the technical functions . right ? yeah ?,15,0.5,0.5509334206581116
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4463142454624176
1,0,and the marketing uh expert should come up with user requirements .,15,0.5,0.6288197636604309
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5887854099273682
1,0,uh did any of you already do some work on this part or,15,0.5,0.7049399614334106
0,0,"well i started making an overview for myself , um what i had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step i have a s specific task to perform or whatever .",15,0.5,0.46852949261665344
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.49216338992118835
1,0,"so i had to uh , i dunno , make an overview for myself about what i have to do ,",15,0.5,0.5420178771018982
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4711381494998932
1,0,and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how i have to fill it .,15,0.5,0.599700391292572
1,0,mm-hmm . and do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?,15,0.5,0.5325024127960205
1,0,"well i started i started with the first phase , i think was the functional .",15,0.5,0.5610600113868713
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6280030012130737
1,0,"and uh let 's see i had to focus on the working design , which you said .",15,0.5,0.5109150409698486
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5672048926353455
0,0,"how does the apparatus work ? and well i basically had two points . uh according to the coffee uh machine example , i have batteries to supply energy ,",15,0.5,0.45999622344970703
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.584818422794342
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6751723289489746
0,0,and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the t_v_ .,15,0.5,0.35568732023239136
1,0,mm-hmm . okay .,15,0.5,0.5279735922813416
1,0,and that 's basically all i have so far .,15,0.5,0.5465764999389648
1,0,yeah i got another point . it uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the t_v_ apparatus or stereo .,15,0.5,0.5391963720321655

0,0,beep beep beep,15,0.5,0.46838319301605225

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.27228081226348877

1,0,"do you would you a argue that that we 're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?",15,0.5,0.543796181678772
0,0,"that that would be uh that would be i think a decision best made by corporate um i i m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , i th i think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .",15,0.5,0.4169992208480835
0,0,mm-hmm . mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.36871102452278137
1,0,"but i 'm sh i 'm sure open to to market this in either direction . but you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost i think it uh there 's nobody else that 's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . the only limitations i see to this is that we 're focused on television only . uh that 's the only that 's the only drawback i see to this . but with all of these other features i think people c one thing i 'm i 'm hoping for is people are not gon na even notice . there 's gon na be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing does n't work for my d_v_d_ and my but i like these other things , so they keep it , they do n't take it back .",15,0.5,0.699435830116272

1,0,well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?,15,0.5,0.5340405106544495

1,0,we we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . but uh,15,0.5,0.5470080375671387
1,0,"yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we 're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that 's that was just an idea i had . uh to me the only additions",15,0.5,0.6318134069442749
0,0,"yeah , the plus there 's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it 's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it 's very simple , and it just works .",15,0.5,0.3086450397968292

1,0,now th that 's the other thing is it 's got ta be cheap .,15,0.5,0.6260117292404175
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4695679545402527

0,0,"well at the moment we could , wa i mean we",15,0.5,0.3669891953468323

1,0,guess,15,0.5,0.520555317401886
1,0,"'cause we this is what we th what we 're doing at the moment is just saying what what we 'd like , and then after we after we 've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not .",15,0.5,0.562305212020874
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.41801717877388

0,0,"what do you reckon ? see 'cause , i 'm just thinking bearing in mind th we 've got ta we have to have something that 's cheap to make .",15,0.5,0.45047786831855774
1,0,"yeah , i mean . yeah , that 's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good t_v_ remote , and have it be um",15,0.5,0.6236828565597534
1,0,i think we 'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker .,15,0.5,0.5392365455627441
0,0,"have it be like ergonomic so it 's comfortable to use ,",15,0.5,0.46794527769088745
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5520977973937988

1,0,"yes and uh evaluation criteria . the finance , it 's uh from my side , from the management , and uh production evaluation . then uh closing . so we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so okay , let 's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype .",15,0.5,0.5033623576164246
1,0,"mm , okay .",15,0.5,0.5205984711647034
1,0,so i handle to,15,0.5,0.5243767499923706
1,0,"i 've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we 've both done , so if i 'm missing anything , christine can just correct me .",15,0.5,0.5582249164581299
1,0,so shall i go to sorry .,15,0.5,0.5887293815612793
0,0,"uh thank you , so you did a powerpoint presentation , good for you .",15,0.5,0.41171231865882874
1,0,"yep . s okay , let 's go to a_m_i_ .",15,0.5,0.6236869692802429
1,0,"it 's not the biggest powerpoint presentation in the world , but",15,0.5,0.5214500427246094
1,0,so in two or three or,15,0.5,0.6029394865036011
1,0,three . um . no it 's,15,0.5,0.5273026823997498
1,0,probably . technical pa i would think .,15,0.5,0.553146481513977
1,0,"think it 's the last one . no , then this is the la yeah , that one , final design .",15,0.5,0.5540876984596252
1,0,ha .,15,0.5,0.5500112175941467
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5683698058128357
1,0,"it is named appropriately , you just could n't see the name .",15,0.5,0.5167508721351624
1,0,"um okay , can i have the mouse ?",15,0.5,0.5804577469825745
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5400968790054321
1,0,"thanks . alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we 've incorporated the l_c_d_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it 's too expensive , well then you just take it off . um , so to unveil our lovely product . this is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see .",15,0.5,0.5985794067382812
0,0,"so if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow l_c_d_ display . um , this is actually hard to do . the yellow button you have is the on off button , so it 's really big , hard to miss . you have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . so up volume up , down volume down . the green are the channel changing . s and it 's one of those very light , very touchable displays . and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the t_v_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . so this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time .",15,0.5,0.49770843982696533
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5400120615959167
1,0,so .,15,0.5,0.5279316902160645
1,0,um and uh i could,15,0.5,0.5599492788314819
1,0,oh yes .,15,0.5,0.5277648568153381
0,0,yeah the d,15,0.5,0.436937153339386
1,0,additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . so that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control .,15,0.5,0.6889103651046753
0,0,we have n't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . that depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um,15,0.5,0.33745619654655457
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5206015706062317
1,0,"i think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the under the flip .",15,0.5,0.6405450105667114
1,0,"yes , okay . uh-huh .",15,0.5,0.5123174786567688
0,0,"so that will be the safe , so p any the chip it 's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to",15,0.5,0.4184393882751465
1,0,"no , i mean it depends on the design of the circuit board .",15,0.5,0.6099914312362671
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.3668802082538605
1,0,"but it should n't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice .",15,0.5,0.6642528772354126
0,0,"uh it 's it 's yeah , but uh uh my opinion i think it 's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . but if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical i do n't think it 's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised .",15,0.5,0.31040555238723755
0,0,"but if you 've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? i mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and i 'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , i can just use my voice .",15,0.5,0.48684975504875183
0,0,maybe i 've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and i 'm holding my cup of coca-cola in the other hand .,15,0.5,0.25634264945983887
1,0,yeah . and you do n't wan na let go of either one .,15,0.5,0.5970939993858337
1,0,i do n't wan na say . louder . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5064517855644226
1,0,"i mean it does n't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere .",15,0.5,0.6195424199104309
0,0,can also be on the side .,15,0.5,0.450954794883728
1,0,"yeah , the sides maybe is good .",15,0.5,0.5435502529144287
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5631313920021057
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5147168040275574
1,0,"so , i mean i can pass this around if anyone wants to",15,0.5,0.5640431642532349
1,0,yes . so it 's maybe good idea .,15,0.5,0.6189231276512146
1,0,"yeah , y better you pass it around with a napkin .",15,0.5,0.5048515200614929
0,0,"no , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would have n't been not be damaged or anything , and it 'd be accessible all the time to voice .",15,0.5,0.45744848251342773
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6299964785575867
1,0,yes . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5330706238746643
1,0,"yeah , exactly .",15,0.5,0.6113762855529785
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5637456178665161
1,0,so it 's maybe good idea . s s,15,0.5,0.6207712888717651
1,0,it 's um it 's um,15,0.5,0.5304346680641174
1,0,compliments to the artist .,15,0.5,0.5994234085083008
1,0,you need to work on the weight a little bit .,15,0.5,0.5411151647567749
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.6162912249565125
1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.5527341961860657
1,0,"okay . s i 'm fine , i 'm satisfi",15,0.5,0.6338127851486206
0,0,"and maybe the shape of the buttons ,",15,0.5,0.4378725290298462
1,0,i 'm satisfied .,15,0.5,0.6151318550109863
1,0,"the little egg shapes are n't the most economical , but",15,0.5,0.52762770652771
1,0,we 're glad you 're satisfied .,15,0.5,0.5511813163757324
1,0,"of course it 's it 's it 's looks more heo heavy , but i think when it 's completely maybe it 's a less weight .",15,0.5,0.5557475090026855
1,0,yeah . i mean this is plasticene .,15,0.5,0.5448114275932312
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.431142121553421
1,0,"there 's only so much you can do . we could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well . but and part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they do n't like something that 's too light , because they do n't feel like they have enough control over it .",15,0.5,0.6987560391426086
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4181579649448395
1,0,"so i mean maybe this is excessively heavy , but i think it needs to have some weight ,",15,0.5,0.5600174069404602
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.470975786447525
1,0,it needs to feel like you 're still holding something . so that 's pretty much it for our presentation actually .,15,0.5,0.6792942881584167
0,0,that 's your uh prototype model ?,15,0.5,0.4333837032318115
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6567361950874329
1,0,"okay , that 's good , thank you very much .",15,0.5,0.517037570476532
1,0,so any comments or uh,15,0.5,0.5720446705818176
0,0,"well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we 've we 've talked about on the previous meetings .",15,0.5,0.4445957839488983
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.561456024646759
1,0,now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh,15,0.5,0.5564072132110596
1,0,"yes , that uh so i 'll come back to the so evaluation criteria , i think uh that will be good , so then let 's come to the finance uh , i have some uh calculations which i made uh as for uh the budget . so here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells . uh it 's optional , somewhat optional and ed wants the chip on print , that 's what uh we were talking about that .",15,0.5,0.5436599254608154

0,0,"so that means we can put the uh the l_c_d_ in , yeah .",15,0.5,0.47916024923324585
1,0,"display in . but as far as production um i 'm putting up a question because we 're talking about profit also , and in mine you 'll see uh the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration .",15,0.5,0.5427859425544739

1,0,"yes , so still uh we have twelve point five euro .",15,0.5,0.5173046588897705

0,0,"yes . this we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down .",15,0.5,0.46462246775627136
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5913471579551697

1,0,it 's gon na be very hard to reduce .,15,0.5,0.5879164338111877
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5606881976127625
1,0,"the circuit board will b you 're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would uh be fixed at the uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one euro .",15,0.5,0.5923487544059753
0,0,that 's not bad .,15,0.5,0.40793099999427795

1,0,"yep . yeah . but anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh i will look after . i will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down .",15,0.5,0.5165005326271057

0,0,functional .,15,0.5,0.45899447798728943
1,0,"uh functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we 'll see .",15,0.5,0.5883051753044128
1,0,"it looks like it , there 's s yeah .",15,0.5,0.5551888346672058

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.7090899348258972
1,0,although since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . okay ? our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study .,15,0.5,0.5719133019447327
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.41997838020324707
1,0,"so if we continue , we 'll look at the findings . next screen . which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year ,",15,0.5,0.6865849494934082
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.41566547751426697
1,0,which is actually a tremendous amount .,15,0.5,0.5036628246307373
0,0,"yeah , no kidding .",15,0.5,0.48440372943878174
1,0,"no kidding , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5545356273651123
1,0,mayb maybe they already expected something .,15,0.5,0.7218143343925476
1,0,"so , if we put an inflated price of fifty euro at a production cost that can not exceed twenty-five euro , okay , we 're already in that that price , okay ,",15,0.5,0.5365772843360901
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.3815789818763733
1,0,"with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we 're gon na break this down between our our retailers .",15,0.5,0.6423999071121216
0,0,um-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4931575357913971
1,0,"twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . at two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit .",15,0.5,0.6297522783279419
0,0,mm-hmm . yep .,15,0.5,0.2971843183040619
1,0,"okay ? so , obviously we w w i just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we 've gone through these . now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there 's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now .",15,0.5,0.6278957724571228
1,0,yes . yep . of course .,15,0.5,0.5039918422698975
1,0,"so , now we have to come up with a decision .",15,0.5,0.5110732316970825
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.38205233216285706
1,0,can the company sell two million units ?,15,0.5,0.6613745093345642
1,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.5344180464744568
0,0,can it sell it for fifty euros ?,15,0.5,0.49523696303367615
1,0,could could i go to findings ?,15,0.5,0.5903649926185608
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.354461133480072
1,0,uh uh um i would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering,15,0.5,0.6768420934677124
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5045750141143799
1,0,"i was thinking the same thing , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6661750078201294
0,0,and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer 's residence .,15,0.5,0.3998158872127533
1,0,directly .,15,0.5,0.5944364070892334
1,0,"that way you have no storage , you have no um you do have transportation , still have the labour cost ,",15,0.5,0.5859883427619934
0,0,um-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4566435217857361

1,0,to the agents .,15,0.5,0.5063316226005554
0,0,"yeah . you can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs .",15,0.5,0.48939281702041626
1,0,"right , like amazon . in fact , we should sell through amazon ,",15,0.5,0.5791730284690857
0,0,"yes . or ebay , or",15,0.5,0.4783538281917572

1,0,well .,15,0.5,0.5584887266159058
1,0,"that actually makes more sense if we 're gon na make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as ,",15,0.5,0.5587892532348633
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3191206455230713
1,0,there are several companies that have gone that way .,15,0.5,0.5522485375404358
1,0,"whereas if you 're in a store , you ca n't unless you 're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want ,",15,0.5,0.5891332030296326
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.2954869866371155
1,0,"whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and",15,0.5,0.6907868981361389
1,0,mm-hmm . and you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you 're missing really is the weight .,15,0.5,0.5107110738754272
1,0,yeah . the weight and feel .,15,0.5,0.5701422691345215

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.49409550428390503
1,0,"we 're getting used to that . it 's not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they ca n't touch before buying .",15,0.5,0.6054025292396545
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.435190349817276
1,0,"there are several that have gone through with the watches , too . you can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production ,",15,0.5,0.5630833506584167
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.5555194616317749

0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.483892023563385
1,0,"and when you 're rotating , you 'll look behind and look this way uh it 's possible to do with this , maybe there 's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit .",15,0.5,0.5784498453140259
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5337784886360168

0,0,"i do n't think that 's uh not possible , it 's uh okay then , l uh let 's wait for the production , okay , then uh you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real .",15,0.5,0.44697898626327515
1,0,what turnaround time do we have ?,15,0.5,0.666570246219635
0,0,t,15,0.5,0.49529901146888733
0,0,'cause i mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long .,15,0.5,0.36753472685813904
1,0,"oh but yes it 's it 's very quick , of course . it will uh come back in two weeks , okay , it will be ready in two weeks .",15,0.5,0.8186392188072205
0,0,works for me .,15,0.5,0.3224095404148102

0,0,"yes , the prototype uh prototype product evaluation .",15,0.5,0.46511921286582947
1,0,in um we probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it .,15,0.5,0.6728659868240356
1,0,yes . yes . yes .,15,0.5,0.5277275443077087

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5517725348472595
0,0,"mm that 'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea ,",15,0.5,0.456839919090271

0,0,"yes , yes .",15,0.5,0.4786211848258972
1,0,"so we 'll do it in the other place , and i do n't think it 's take more than four weeks time . or uh okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then uh it 's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team , okay , uh from the management , then we can launch in the market . hm ?",15,0.5,0.5491245985031128

1,0,very specific .,15,0.5,0.6202563047409058

1,0,maybe what,15,0.5,0.5580303072929382
1,0,so i think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event .,15,0.5,0.5601089596748352
1,0,yes . yes .,15,0.5,0.5863301157951355

1,0,um in the same order as last time ?,15,0.5,0.538557767868042

0,0,okay uh welcome you all .,15,0.5,0.45753902196884155
1,0,"components design , um uh first of all uh i would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things i uh uh elaborate some of the things i did . i i elaborated on the concept . what should be um uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . uh well first of all i 've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control 's formed . uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . i would like to uh give you an idea of uh how i thought about .",15,0.5,0.5958159565925598
0,0,do n't destroy my giraffe .,15,0.5,0.44177713990211487
0,0,giraffe 's gone now .,15,0.5,0.4208139181137085
1,0,"okay um the case was is made from rubber , i suppose . there 's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control",15,0.5,0.6267748475074768
0,0,drop it .,15,0.5,0.40814971923828125
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4530337154865265
1,0,"and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option . but uh it 's a very expensive material . uh rubber is , i think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control . um it 's poss it 's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour . uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it 's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that 's sor uh that 's that 's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it 's still the same colour , perhaps uh it 's a little bit damaged . but it 's a very strong material . um i h i had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved .",15,0.5,0.6262106895446777
1,0,uh so it 's t two dimensional . i think it 's uh it 's best to draw oh,15,0.5,0.5578294396400452
0,0,it 's a colour .,15,0.5,0.43432527780532837

1,0,uh new . blank . okay .,15,0.5,0.6108810305595398
0,0,you have to go t,15,0.5,0.40776801109313965
1,0,let 's make it uh black . okay . i thought of an idea like this . oh that . um delete . blank . okay . so it also looks nice when it 's on your table .,15,0.5,0.6962883472442627
1,0,"so you get uh it does n't lay flat down on the table , but it 's c it 's stands .",15,0.5,0.5244691371917725
1,0,oh it 's a side view .,15,0.5,0.6611478328704834
1,0,"side view yes it 's side view so uh i i 'm not technically good at th three d_ modelling ,",15,0.5,0.5115740895271301
1,0,but .,15,0.5,0.6046897768974304
0,0,"um uh it 's just an idea i had so it 's uh it 's very uh so its also looks nice when it 's on the table . um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . uh i thought about uh the l_c_d_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too . one of the great uh advantages of the l_c_d_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff .",15,0.5,0.4443715512752533
1,0,and um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . well i already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and i think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component .,15,0.5,0.5686485171318054
0,0,true .,15,0.5,0.45313945412635803
1,0,"so uh uh that 's all about uh the buttons . uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . questions , ?",15,0.5,0.5643461346626282
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.48807135224342346
1,0,no no no no no . just looking .,15,0.5,0.5878931283950806
1,0,"and they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . and next step is the chip uh th the component that 's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but i think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it",15,0.5,0.5239447951316833
1,0,"with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side . uh my personal preferences uh i also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . that was correct , was n't it ?",15,0.5,0.5802105665206909
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5910810828208923
1,0,okay . i think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber .,15,0.5,0.5589805841445923
0,0,"well , business colours i thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour ,",15,0.5,0.46663913130760193
0,0,"okay they should be m sh they should be in mind ,",15,0.5,0.49389559030532837
1,0,but i do n't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour .,15,0.5,0.6917213201522827
1,0,was n't it ? okay so it d it does n't says uh to uh have the slogan ?,15,0.5,0.5027410387992859
0,0,it must be recognisable .,15,0.5,0.4367937743663788
1,0,okay okay . well that 's possible of course .,15,0.5,0.5991969704627991
0,0,you can put the r_ and r_ .,15,0.5,0.4222172796726227
0,0,"we could make a little r_ and r_ on the top of the machine . uh so they are pretty boring , i suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it 's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find they 're uh interesting . and uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . uh s as i said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it 's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . and i personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , because it yeah it makes sense .",15,0.5,0.45222923159599304
1,0,okay . well that 's all about my uh my findings .,15,0.5,0.5363261103630066
1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.5993782877922058

0,0,"i thought a little bit about the interface . uh how it should look . and uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an l_c_d_ screen , so i had to uh look on that . and the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . and this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . and they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . and so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning joe or what 's your name .",15,0.5,0.4905928671360016

0,0,it 's true .,15,0.5,0.48576653003692627
1,0,and perhaps we could uh implement that .,15,0.5,0.5485686659812927
1,0,and then i have to go out of the presentation because i tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like,15,0.5,0.559194803237915
1,0,oh my god .,15,0.5,0.5742824077606201
1,0,"but i ca n't draw , so uh do n't make too much of it . i tried to uh the l_c_d_ screen i tried to sort of to draw . i thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . i do n't know if there is an icon for the program , but",15,0.5,0.5146125555038452

1,0,.. .,15,0.5,0.5338599681854248
0,0,and then the buttons above and uh below,15,0.5,0.42418015003204346
1,0,the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . um .,15,0.5,0.5216349363327026

0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.3648005723953247
0,0,does n't matter .,15,0.5,0.4709107577800751
0,0,"um an options button . and i thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it 's not really options , i think . it 's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the t_v_ and that kind of uh thing .",15,0.5,0.4431900978088379

1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5027669072151184

0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4086434841156006
1,0,"but this is a bit uh how i thought it . and uh the l_c_d_ uh somewhere on the remote . perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it 's better in your hand or something uh .",15,0.5,0.5183914303779602

1,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.520842432975769
1,0,so i 'll have to put that oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there ?,15,0.5,0.6052091717720032
0,0,"for the case itself , one colour . it 's one special colour .",15,0.5,0.48573362827301025
1,0,"just one colour , okay .",15,0.5,0.5217201113700867
1,0,"'cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it .",15,0.5,0.5388892292976379
1,0,"okay so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ?",15,0.5,0.529799222946167
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.38224563002586365

1,0,how many,15,0.5,0.6283345818519592
0,0,um we have um got some push buttons as well .,15,0.5,0.40788331627845764
1,0,or even clear .,15,0.5,0.5677226185798645
0,0,we 've got push buttons as well .,15,0.5,0.486438125371933
0,0,like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push,15,0.5,0.45397648215293884
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.42391079664230347
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6238487958908081
0,0,so i reckon we 've got one button for this thing 'cause it 's just one big sheet of rubber .,15,0.5,0.4597840905189514
0,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.47497427463531494
1,0,i 'm not sure if that counts but,15,0.5,0.5325153470039368
0,0,okay let 's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .,15,0.5,0.32419344782829285
1,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.587975025177002
0,0,"okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again .",15,0.5,0.44365474581718445
1,0,four .,15,0.5,0.5957425236701965
1,0,you can see we 're we 're all very far beyond the,15,0.5,0.502395510673523
1,0,so w why are we arriving at the number four ? where does the number four come from ?,15,0.5,0.5805666446685791
0,0,'cause that 's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons .,15,0.5,0.3449021875858307
1,0,"okay right ,",15,0.5,0.5399816632270813
1,0,so we 're just estimating that yeah it would be less .,15,0.5,0.5814670324325562
1,0,so we 're writing down four . okay . how about these ? are we wanting them in,15,0.5,0.5550994873046875
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5262649059295654
1,0,no they 're just,15,0.5,0.571945071220398
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4836679995059967
1,0,is everything gon na be plastic ?,15,0.5,0.6915888786315918
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.36450332403182983
1,0,okay . so we 're w w quite far over .,15,0.5,0.6684576272964478
1,0,now we 're gon na something 's gon na have to go . um we 're at sixteen point eight and,15,0.5,0.6030675768852234
0,0,uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high-end product if,15,0.5,0.3747248947620392
1,0,"well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three euro ,",15,0.5,0.6802290678024292
0,0,we only have very sparse,15,0.5,0.4747411608695984
0,0,"so let me see , what are we i mean",15,0.5,0.4710386097431183
1,0,two point three ? four point three no ?,15,0.5,0.6251852512359619
1,0,"oh yes sorry , four point three . my maths is all out .",15,0.5,0.5460283756256104
0,0,"well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .",15,0.5,0.42525774240493774
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6153148412704468
1,0,how much would that save us ?,15,0.5,0.5571522116661072
1,0,and then where is the,15,0.5,0.5258155465126038
1,0,how much would that save us ?,15,0.5,0.5265564918518066
1,0,that will only save you one .,15,0.5,0.5251835584640503
1,0,that is one .,15,0.5,0.5710721611976624
0,0,"the other thing could be that um you could take away the l_c_d_ panel and the advanced chip together ,",15,0.5,0.4788651168346405
1,0,one .,15,0.5,0.6133813261985779
1,0,"um because when you do something on the t_v_ , the t_v_ responds and reacts as well ,",15,0.5,0.589357316493988
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3825032413005829
1,0,so the user could be looking at the t_v_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to,15,0.5,0.6278562545776367
0,0,"that 's fair enough , yeah .",15,0.5,0.371698796749115
1,0,"so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond ,",15,0.5,0.6161496043205261
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4058830738067627
1,0,which i think is a technically doable thing so,15,0.5,0.556053102016449
0,0,okay so,15,0.5,0.40970751643180847
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.567040205001831
1,0,so w what 's our reviewed suggestion ?,15,0.5,0.5299769043922424
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5823639035224915
1,0,um take away the l_c_ display ?,15,0.5,0.5955662131309509
0,0,yep . and the advanced chip goes away as well .,15,0.5,0.4067821204662323
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6633896231651306
1,0,to be replaced with a,15,0.5,0.5734562277793884
0,0,regular chip .,15,0.5,0.47043901681900024
1,0,regular chip .,15,0.5,0.536152720451355
1,0,yep . so what that means is that um,15,0.5,0.5671221613883972
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5382444858551025
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5432877540588379
0,0,and so we 've got point three to get rid of . um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ?,15,0.5,0.3899153769016266
0,0,the twelve buttons that you see there .,15,0.5,0.42271482944488525
1,0,twelve buttons .,15,0.5,0.5236285924911499
0,0,that 's um one piece of rubber but it 's gon na have twelve button things underneath so,15,0.5,0.49508175253868103
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5029869675636292

1,0,"yeah . hi , me raj , again . uh in this meeting i i 'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology . the met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way we have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . so what are our findings ? in our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . so this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . so we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls .",15,0.5,0.6495655179023743

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4318813681602478
1,0,"the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . so it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that .",15,0.5,0.7258972525596619

0,0,is it ? but the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . but i presume that the functions must come up on the t_v_ screen .,15,0.5,0.4885616898536682
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.49725541472435
1,0,"yeah , presumably .",15,0.5,0.6182161569595337
1,0,"i think that 's what that is . so these are just a few ideas . again that 's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , i think on that one .",15,0.5,0.519669234752655
1,0,uh it looks threatening .,15,0.5,0.6346048712730408
1,0,"yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet .",15,0.5,0.5518617033958435
0,0,"yeah , it does look kind of dangerous .",15,0.5,0.4607177674770355
1,0,it looks like yeah .,15,0.5,0.6629474759101868
1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5541942119598389
1,0,um this one i thought was really cool . it 's w it 's got the programmability function that we talked about .,15,0.5,0.5226354598999023
0,0,"you can put it in there , it 's for your kids , and it 's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool .",15,0.5,0.4638127386569977
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5631508231163025
1,0,"and that 's really easy to use , bright , so i like this one lot for our design . i think something like that would be good .",15,0.5,0.6065686941146851
0,0,wow .,15,0.5,0.34788814187049866
1,0,"yeah , i m i mean the one thing i think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , i 've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .",15,0.5,0.6766735315322876
0,0,of course yellow .,15,0.5,0.44244638085365295
0,0,so like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever .,15,0.5,0.44371652603149414
1,0,"right , yeah . yeah , that 's true . yeah . um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the t_v_ or something . and this one , the over-sized one , i do n't know about you , but i think it 's a bit too gimmicky .",15,0.5,0.6273987293243408
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6204546689987183
1,0,i do n't think that will sell very well .,15,0.5,0.5754755735397339
0,0,"i mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ?",15,0.5,0.46929895877838135
1,0,i guess so . i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.5862105488777161
1,0,then d blind do n't watch t_v_ .,15,0.5,0.5412746667861938
1,0,strange .,15,0.5,0.5809075236320496
0,0,i think that 's a bit yeah exactly .,15,0.5,0.42432335019111633
1,0,"no they do , they do .",15,0.5,0.636746883392334
1,0,they do ?,15,0.5,0.5273123979568481
1,0,they listen to it . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5702460408210754
0,0,"yeah . and um this one is just pointing out . i like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .",15,0.5,0.4761333167552948
1,0,"right , okay .",15,0.5,0.6471019983291626
0,0,so that could that 's a bit confusing . um but the buttons on this i think are it 's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . they do n't have to be all the same . so that 's quite cool . um .,15,0.5,0.3215435743331909
1,0,"'kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , do n't they ?",15,0.5,0.634921669960022
0,0,"yeah , exactly . um f_ five . yes . so there are some of the findings . so we need to combine those ones um",15,0.5,0.3953028619289398
1,0,and i 've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in .,15,0.5,0.5383867621421814
0,0,brilliant . that 's handy .,15,0.5,0.3584109842777252
1,0,"um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . um so i think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good .",15,0.5,0.6384816765785217
1,1,"uh it fell off . one , two , three , four , yeah , we 're ready . okay . welcome to this second meeting . um it 's now quarter after twelve and we 're given forty minutes um for this meeting . this is a meeting on functional design . um and i wan na welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . um i did took the minutes from the first meeting and i 'll show them to you in a moment . um i know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , i thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there 's i happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . okay ? is this ap everybody agree with this ?",15,0.5,0.5388220548629761
1,0,oops .,15,0.5,0.5604549646377563
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5095706582069397
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.6566219329833984
1,0,"okay . um and after the meeting there 'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting . and go to that one . um as you can see it was this earlier today . um kate , steph , sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . i opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese . and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting anybody have any questions on those minutes ? are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 'kay .",15,0.5,0.5744600892066956
1,0,"uh i think so ,",15,0.5,0.5339561104774475
1,0,did i miss something ?,15,0.5,0.7202216982841492
0,0,we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well .,15,0.5,0.4969480335712433
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4193289279937744
1,0,"yeah . i 'm afraid i incorporated that when i said who was present , but yes , we did ,",15,0.5,0.5085375905036926
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5876715183258057
0,0,"and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures ,",15,0.5,0.43299922347068787
1,0,"okay , i accept the minutes .",15,0.5,0.6361475586891174
1,0,but i did n't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . so um as a group i think we 've are they 're accepting the minutes . and uh okay .,15,0.5,0.5510148406028748
1,0,is that what we 're supposed to say ?,15,0.5,0.5274348855018616
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6089977025985718
1,1,well i do n't know if it 'll fit into our cost of twelve point five euro you know .,15,0.5,0.535385012626648
0,0,uh you th you think it 's possible .,15,0.5,0.4910707473754883
1,0,is it possible to fit in to that ?,15,0.5,0.5691013932228088
1,0,"yeah also thinking , i think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh euros , it will be okay ,",15,0.5,0.5100641250610352
1,0,sorry .,15,0.5,0.6029518842697144
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.40581098198890686
1,0,but uh .,15,0.5,0.7001559734344482
1,0,well maybe we need specific costings then . actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gon na fit in our budget better .,15,0.5,0.5820604562759399
0,0,mm yes,15,0.5,0.37955179810523987
1,0,yeah that 's an excellent idea .,15,0.5,0.7455253601074219
0,0,wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price .,15,0.5,0.464532732963562
1,0,yeah yeah . yeah,15,0.5,0.6086307764053345
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.42618119716644287
1,0,that w that would be a very good idea .,15,0.5,0.6794192790985107
0,0,because right now i do n't have price in in head,15,0.5,0.4921649992465973
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3928698003292084
1,0,but for next meeting i 'm sure yeah be able to do that .,15,0.5,0.5697605609893799
1,1,yes . thank you . okay . and uh ed uh so what 's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ?,15,0.5,0.5507957935333252
1,0,"well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they 're building , their designs , their ideas ,",15,0.5,0.6151362657546997
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3231537640094757
1,0,uh also have to pinpoint which market we 're gon na go into .,15,0.5,0.6673834919929504
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4755803644657135
1,0,"it should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition ,",15,0.5,0.5948111414909363
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.47980010509490967
0,1,"um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models .",15,0.5,0.4183518886566162
1,0,"yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it 's to the individual also .",15,0.5,0.56275874376297
1,0,"well , you know um , i kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that 's very fashionable , that 's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wan na have it uh have one of their own . so it would really would need to um something like the ipod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well ,",15,0.5,0.5388073921203613
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5950050950050354

1,0,morning .,15,0.5,0.543660581111908
1,0,"i 'll be your project manager for today , for this project . my name is mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off . that 's my uh that 's the agenda for today . well , of course we 're new to each other , so i 'd like to get acquainted first . so let 's do that first , i mean let 's start with you , can you introduce yourself ? you 're our marketing expert .",15,0.5,0.6467400789260864
1,0,"yes . um my name is dirk , dirk meinfeld . um i will be uh pr project the marketing expert . and i will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project product .",15,0.5,0.539746880531311
0,0,"okay , excellent . and you are user interface",15,0.5,0.31691664457321167
1,0,"nick broer ,",15,0.5,0.5358870029449463
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6885446906089783
0,0,user interface designer . i 'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view .,15,0.5,0.45657604932785034
1,0,excellent . okay .,15,0.5,0.580224335193634
1,0,"my name is xavier juergens , i 'm the industrial designer , and there are three main questions that i have to find an answer to today . first one is uh what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is uh the apparatus made of ,",15,0.5,0.5827507972717285
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4438115358352661
1,0,and the third is what should it look like .,15,0.5,0.5681651830673218
1,0,what should it look like ? okay .,15,0.5,0.5186527371406555
1,1,"okay uh agnes , you can help me for the slide when",15,0.5,0.5700952410697937
0,0,yep . sure .,15,0.5,0.4855051338672638
1,0,"okay . okay , welcome back . i hope uh you have a fresh head and a fresh time . how t now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting . okay , and uh we 'll issue some information from uh all of you . and it 's in the , i think uh , in the sharing folder . and uh i will invite uh the christine and the ed and uh agnes to discuss about on the various subjects . so can you go to the next slide ? yeah uh the agenda of the meeting is opening . then uh i 'm going to talk about uh the project management , what i 'm going to do , and uh , of course , i 'm doing the project management and secretary both , okay , to take the minutes of the meeting . and there are three presentations . one is uh new project requirements . and the second one about uh decision on remote control functions . and uh finally we are closing . uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes , so you have to be very quick . and i have come up with the management come with the new proposal , okay , and i have to discuss a few points on this . uh both says new insights in the aim of your project . uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology . so we do n't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . and the second one is about uh the remote control . should be used only for the t_v_ . that 's what our uh management says . and the third point , it 's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product . okay . so i will invite uh agnes , can you go to the third slide ?",15,0.5,0.5625543594360352
1,0,"no , this is the third slide .",15,0.5,0.5779736638069153
1,0,"okay , . so , i 'll invite uh christine to discuss about uh the functional design .",15,0.5,0.5011821985244751
1,0,"'kay , do you wan na open the",15,0.5,0.5481009483337402
1,0,sure . um . you 're participant s,15,0.5,0.5009679198265076
1,0,i 'm number two .,15,0.5,0.5640321969985962
1,0,two ?,15,0.5,0.5032962560653687
0,0,that 's it .,15,0.5,0.48438072204589844
1,0,"do you want the mouse , or do you want me to",15,0.5,0.6755757331848145
0,0,"i 'll do the notes . yeah , thanks .",15,0.5,0.3158312141895294
1,0,"so um well i i figured uh we should um identify some user requirements , and from my experience , i wan na uh , and from research i did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you ca n't uh ca n't have like uh waffling on this point , you know .",15,0.5,0.7199385762214661
0,0,"really have it needs to be able y y have to be able to find it . because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . so uh , i also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those , and , as i said in the first meeting , um and then uh we might wan na talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product",15,0.5,0.469820111989975
0,0,"so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth . i did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , so , i guess this guy zenith uh created the flashmatic , which i kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the t_v_ on and off , that might be interesting . and um so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so i think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later .",15,0.5,0.4532499611377716
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5076385140419006
0,0,"and uh it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was uh sensitive to the sun , so that uh it would get would start off by the you 'd get it would easily cause um problems . so , uh i in addition to uh looking at the um uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today which i think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind .",15,0.5,0.443744957447052
1,0,fantastic .,15,0.5,0.5903843641281128
1,0,"it 'd be easy to find . and um it would uh y you 'd you could throw it at things if if the t_v_ did n't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . and since i 'm not really um industrial designer , i did n't really know what to do with this slide . but um i just took some different uh schematics and i put them into this , and i guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . i do n't know why um we were asked to do this . so , uh personal preferences , um",15,0.5,0.5275102257728577
1,0,"i think we could uh i i 'm really thinking outside the box here , and i think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference .",15,0.5,0.6276052594184875
0,0,"so something that 's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . i think um it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you did n't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user 's home . um i think uh it needs to be waterproof , because uh sometimes they fall into cups",15,0.5,0.36741819977760315
1,0,"and , you know , it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that . um if you uh mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it 's done its job or not , because half the time , i keep pushing on the remote control , and i do n't know if it 's actually understood my message , so i think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . and uh , course i never wan na replace the battery . so ,",15,0.5,0.7825469970703125
0,0,"that 's those are my f preferences , and that 's my presentation .",15,0.5,0.32660335302352905
1,0,"yeah , let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable .",15,0.5,0.5830206871032715
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.49373912811279297
0,0,"okay , because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids ,",15,0.5,0.47302839159965515
1,0,"okay , and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes and .",15,0.5,0.6306542158126831
0,0,run over it with a car .,15,0.5,0.2855142652988434
1,0,"yes . okay , so if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable , okay , i think that will give a lot of advantage for our product , if i 'm not wrong . maybe you can uh add it in that .",15,0.5,0.5285370349884033
1,0,"good idea . good idea , i 'll i 'll uh um yes , very good .",15,0.5,0.5774745941162109
0,0,"okay , uh thank you christine , and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ?",15,0.5,0.47362959384918213
1,0,"do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? 'cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder ,",15,0.5,0.5469154119491577
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.34468406438827515
1,0,"whereas having something like , i dunno , steel or titanium is n't really economically viable .",15,0.5,0.6368560791015625
1,0,"titanium . titanium would be be heavy , too ,",15,0.5,0.5409051179885864

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6641713380813599
0,0,"no , i have n't really um i wanted feedback , i think we need to rate rank these , but we 'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts .",15,0.5,0.49789509177207947

1,0,thirty-five percent say they 're too difficult to use . so we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly . uh fifty percent say they ca n't find the remote half the time .,15,0.5,0.643843948841095

1,0,"so um might uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost . not sure how . but um anyway , um i i think also that uh this might impact the battery life . and um so , maybe what we 'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly so that uh y you know sen send power to it . so uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there",15,0.5,0.6288360953330994

1,0,"it seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it 's a great feature , but if you 're watching t_v_ , there 's a lot of ambient sound , and it 's words . it 's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . it 's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the t_v_ speech , and the the user 's speech . otherwise , you can say remote .",15,0.5,0.5760489702224731

0,0,alri,15,0.5,0.42788660526275635
1,0,"yeah , and that 's fine . okay . so , basically , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people do n't like about existing products . so , in our case , existing remote controls . and then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they 're bad and good , which is n't always as obvious . we seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that 's not the case . then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that 'll feed into both ed 's work and christine 's work . um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we 've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . so , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off . you need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . you need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the t_v_ to regulate contrast or whatever . so , the problems that people have expressed is that there 's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . the buttons it 's not clear what they 're supposed to do . um often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , um which you do n't necessarily always remember , especially if it 's a functionality that you do n't use very often . and that the buttons are too small . so , here we 've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons .",15,0.5,0.581731915473938
0,0,"the buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . um they 're hard to see , and okay , they 're labelled , but the labels do n't necessarily tell you too much . whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that i think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed . and it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . so , i would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . and if there 's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . so my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple .",15,0.5,0.4134589731693268
0,0,click mm .,15,0.5,0.4372709095478058

1,0,"yes , that 's true . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5341777801513672

0,0,we 'll g then we 'll go for a a s small small bear .,15,0.5,0.4099392592906952
1,0,um and i like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um i dunno maybe because there 's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that .,15,0.5,0.5851256251335144
1,0,great .,15,0.5,0.5450010895729065

0,0,"right . there 's my dog . um i like dogs because they 're very loyal . and they 're always happy , so whenever whenever you 're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they 're always coming up and they 're always um quite excited . so um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . and they 're also good for exercise as well . you can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . and and when they 're tired they 're quite cute as well , so .",15,0.5,0.4524213373661041

1,0,"right , um . well i 've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh i 'm not too keen on them anyway . not to worry . so what my daughters have got at the moment is they 've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um wo n't prove too difficult to draw . uh",15,0.5,0.5502182245254517
1,0,as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well .,15,0.5,0.5626903772354126
1,0,"anyway um . and uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they do n't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you 're going away on holiday or whatever , you 've got ta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . whereas if you got fish , you just got ta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you 're away and uh change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . other than the fact that they keep dying ,",15,0.5,0.60603266954422

0,0,"yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.42789724469184875

1,0,"and then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . uh , so i think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons , you know . all th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh",15,0.5,0.6220142841339111

1,0,"well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . so and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it 's interesting point . also the people are worried about about the r * _s_i_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old . so s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . they are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so i think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost .",15,0.5,0.6580820083618164
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3317687511444092
1,0,and also i found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .,15,0.5,0.5652121901512146
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4978125989437103
0,0,"so in my opinion the mando this mando should n't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like the the liklier it is to get lost . liklier or more likely ?",15,0.5,0.4910987615585327
0,0,more likely .,15,0.5,0.44959110021591187
0,0,"likely . okay . uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but they they should n't they should n't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . also the z the design should fit the hand shape . so it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .",15,0.5,0.3717159926891327
1,0,"well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . so unless you 're kind of targeting single people you know you 're gon na maybe",15,0.5,0.6589644551277161
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.2681787312030792
1,0,cut out some a lot of your market .,15,0.5,0.5846078395843506
1,0,i dunno i th anyway i think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls .,15,0.5,0.5232781767845154
0,0,well maybe it could be a universal design .,15,0.5,0.3464963734149933
1,0,sorry ?,15,0.5,0.6503766775131226
0,0,"a universal design , which is which is good for both the hands .",15,0.5,0.4166070520877838
0,0,"still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ?",15,0.5,0.46813780069351196
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6151284575462341
0,0,"yeah ? that 's right , whether it 's left hand or right hand ,",15,0.5,0.4423656463623047
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6637617349624634
0,0,"but but do n't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?",15,0.5,0.48797425627708435
1,0,sorry ?,15,0.5,0.5862405896186829
1,0,"the first and the third point , they are clashing .",15,0.5,0.5759130716323853
0,0,"well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand .",15,0.5,0.3726239800453186
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5630485415458679

1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.5412195920944214
1,0,like uh,15,0.5,0.5539875626564026
0,0,so fitting the hand does n't mean much then .,15,0.5,0.3279103636741638
1,0,"well it means like , this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger",15,0.5,0.6304699182510376
0,0,mm-hmm mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3911854922771454

1,0,mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5535387396812439
1,0,so it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ?,15,0.5,0.5083248019218445
1,0,"little sleek , longer ?",15,0.5,0.5099502205848694
0,0,and it should fit the hand .,15,0.5,0.3886401653289795
1,0,no no i was thinking of so like something,15,0.5,0.6070443391799927
1,0,something with the shape of the palm ?,15,0.5,0.5196028351783752

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6138690710067749
0,0,some finger grips maybe .,15,0.5,0.45901569724082947
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6006017327308655
1,0,"you could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything ,",15,0.5,0.5213285684585571
1,0,on the sides .,15,0.5,0.583382785320282
1,0,yeah yeah . it sh it should n't it should n't be symmetric symmetrical .,15,0.5,0.5099319815635681

1,0,not anymore . that 's what yeah .,15,0.5,0.5806701183319092
0,0,and then finally,15,0.5,0.42741015553474426
1,0,"and finally , the incorporation of a l_c_d_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but i do n't know if the budget would be large enough .",15,0.5,0.6356119513511658
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.39233750104904175
1,0,yeah . first i 'm just wondering about the l_c_d_ stuff because uh because,15,0.5,0.6707639098167419
1,0,but most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .,15,0.5,0.5737319588661194
0,0,"yeah , so maybe it 's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations . we had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to t_v_ .",15,0.5,0.426242470741272
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5257943272590637
1,0,"okay , i dunno if you had this information already . no ,",15,0.5,0.5864441394805908
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.4107031226158142
1,0,so they want us to restrict the remote control to t_v_ only because of time limitations . um they want also uh,15,0.5,0.566430389881134
1,0,actually this marketing report is restricted to t_v_ remote controls .,15,0.5,0.5877453088760376
0,0,"excellent . so we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and uh finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product . so",15,0.5,0.4143673777580261
1,0,"i was still uh i was still working on this uh twenty five euro price point because i think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price if if we 're maybe i can get to this in my presentation though ,",15,0.5,0.5304747223854065
0,0,yeah yeah . sure sure .,15,0.5,0.4648156464099884
1,0,but um yeah .,15,0.5,0.6644557118415833
1,0,"so maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now .",15,0.5,0.5286465287208557
0,0,yep . okay .,15,0.5,0.47379952669143677
1,0,okay so let 's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about l_c_d_ and speech uh reco,15,0.5,0.5150820016860962
1,0,yeah . i think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you 're watching t_v_ you 're gon na have a lot of this uh background noise from the t_v_ which might interfere with the,15,0.5,0.6332184672355652
0,0,"sorry , what is your ?",15,0.5,0.491591215133667
1,0,"uh participant three . you might have some background noise from the t_v_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so .",15,0.5,0.5394837856292725
1,0,"yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so yeah yeah .",15,0.5,0.5187583565711975
1,0,"oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the t_v_ the t_v_ sound turns off .",15,0.5,0.5003654360771179
0,0,yeah uh channel fifty .,15,0.5,0.38108038902282715
1,0,no it could be command control kind of thing .,15,0.5,0.6946679353713989
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3220873773097992
1,0,"it requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition .",15,0.5,0.6336186528205872
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4178096354007721
1,0,because this kind of thing means speech is there from the t_v_ also .,15,0.5,0.6101259589195251
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3960316777229309
1,0,"so there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop .",15,0.5,0.5753875374794006
1,0,mm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5091918706893921
1,0,"it 's like v_i_ editor , you are having two modes similarly .",15,0.5,0.5700035691261292
0,0,otherwise it 's just lying idle .,15,0.5,0.4914305806159973
0,0,okay michael .,15,0.5,0.4625193476676941
1,0,"okay , so , could i describe the mouse maybe be easier to",15,0.5,0.5386134386062622
1,0,sorry ?,15,0.5,0.5399976968765259
1,0,"could i use the mouse , or",15,0.5,0.5442749261856079
1,0,um yeah .,15,0.5,0.6916298270225525
1,0,mm . thanks . okay .,15,0.5,0.6507036089897156
0,0,the wheel does n't work .,15,0.5,0.4046528935432434
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.3765883445739746
1,0,"okay so um while uh researching this this topic i first of all just thought of a couple of things that i would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they 're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . so um there 's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it 's not really it 's by no means uh mm you know on it 's own in being so expensive . there are a lot of expensive remote controls out there .",15,0.5,0.7289760708808899
0,0,looks like a p_d_a_ ?,15,0.5,0.4265846610069275
1,0,"so yeah it doe it 's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the l_c_d_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , i know we 're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these l_c_d_ screens which kind of helps when you 're using multiple uh devices i suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times . but um the thing that i find most interesting about this remote control , and it 's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , which i think is it 's a really kind of important design aspect um is it 's 'cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . and obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel .",15,0.5,0.6003172993659973
0,0,change the channels .,15,0.5,0.41249585151672363
0,0,now um,15,0.5,0.4896728992462158
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6238572001457214
1,0,uh the i think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'cause i know when i um when i use the remote to change the channel i very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . i usually use the up and down,15,0.5,0.5692157745361328
1,0,mmm-hmm mm-hmm . yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.6600319743156433
1,0,"because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that 's just uh it 's annoying . so i think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an l_c_d_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability .",15,0.5,0.5274648070335388
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5284920930862427
1,0,"one possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff ca n't be done for twenty five eu uh euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the l_c_d_ screen so that instead of actually saying i want to i want to go to channel thirty seven because i know this programme 's on , you know , often you do n't know what ch what channel it 's on , or you do n't know what 's on . if you have a list of of programs on your l_c_d_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . so if you think about it 's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you do n't use you do n't remember people 's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it .",15,0.5,0.510289192199707
1,0,"so this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price . so , i mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it 's it 's it 's very simple , there 's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . so this is something else we might wan na consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on epinions . it it 's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really i think people want to be able to find the button they 're looking for without even looking at the remote control . and was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but i think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . so if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want .",15,0.5,0.5437498092651367
0,0,but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality .,15,0.5,0.48879557847976685
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.3886224329471588
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5283277630805969
0,0,yeah well we w,15,0.5,0.4605523943901062
0,0,because the same button is doing too many things .,15,0.5,0.4995271861553192
0,0,"yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we 're only doing uh a television remote control . um i think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . um",15,0.5,0.44750747084617615
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.409348726272583
1,0,"i i would if i had my perfect remote control , i 'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they 're just in the way .",15,0.5,0.6262843608856201
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4169169068336487
0,0,"they do n't really do anything . maybe you know i although i do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good .",15,0.5,0.47769972681999207
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5642396211624146
0,0,"um but i think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . um",15,0.5,0.37307509779930115
1,0,h i think i think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control should n't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it 's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional,15,0.5,0.7035316228866577
0,0,it does sampling out of the .,15,0.5,0.3440314829349518
1,0,"well i guess that depends on how you market it . if you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy .",15,0.5,0.6872773766517639
0,0,if y,15,0.5,0.36767616868019104
0,0,"okay , can you continue , please mi ?",15,0.5,0.4556340277194977
1,0,"so , but",15,0.5,0.5986872315406799
1,0,"yep . um okay , so , i think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . so if we can have a higher priced uh remote control i think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing . um mm there 's the l_c_d_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but i think also at the scroll wheel , i have n't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an l_c_d_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . i think even that ,",15,0.5,0.5611681938171387
1,0,"i mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an l_c_d_ screen , to implement ,",15,0.5,0.5236349105834961
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6632118225097656
1,0,"um but i think that would be quite useful as well . and the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but i think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there 's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , and maybe we wan na make it something that 's extensible to do other tasks . say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . you know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it does n't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you also , selling the potential of the device . then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , i dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , i think that 's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we 're putting the fashion in electronics .",15,0.5,0.664627730846405
1,0,"okay . okay . okay , thanks . you want to go ?",15,0.5,0.5011728405952454
0,0,yep . so yeah .,15,0.5,0.2622099816799164
1,0,"so most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own i",15,0.5,0.7050985097885132
0,0,this one ?,15,0.5,0.3618331849575043
1,0,"yeah , it should be .",15,0.5,0.5289973020553589
1,0,"great . no , not that one . you are two .",15,0.5,0.5568674802780151
0,0,two .,15,0.5,0.4834586977958679
1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.6092541217803955
1,0,"okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . so he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . so the old kind of users who do n't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our marketing expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing .",15,0.5,0.5679782032966614
0,0,"okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .",15,0.5,0.49131643772125244

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.7187632322311401

1,0,"means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . so spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . so if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is ,",15,0.5,0.5451289415359497
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4360194504261017
1,0,"and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five euros money which we are thinking . otherwise we are just like others in the market . so anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which can not be done now actually . so apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . and for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .",15,0.5,0.5504075884819031
0,0,yeah . that increases the the cost also .,15,0.5,0.3726102411746979
1,0,uh that 's right . but uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that .,15,0.5,0.6293801665306091
0,0,do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ?,15,0.5,0.4254218339920044
0,0,"uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it 's enough .",15,0.5,0.36737629771232605
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.49749279022216797
1,0,"yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc",15,0.5,0.5422978401184082
0,0,well wh uh i imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones,15,0.5,0.4335472285747528
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3905356824398041
1,0,because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control .,15,0.5,0.7060918211936951
1,0,that 's right . no it it could be little d yeah it could be,15,0.5,0.5312219262123108
0,0,so it could be s a few centimetres .,15,0.5,0.3712715208530426
1,0,"well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though ,",15,0.5,0.7371814846992493
0,0,that 's right . that 's right .,15,0.5,0.38895687460899353
1,0,"because , i 'm not sure exactly where we 're gon na sell this , but i presume it 's not gon na just be english speaking countries .",15,0.5,0.5129473805427551
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6518210172653198
1,0,"so then you have to s you know , you have to train models for",15,0.5,0.514332115650177
0,0,"mm-hmm mm-hmm . uh it 's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so d_t_w_ could be kind of which is the easiest . so you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and it 's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller .",15,0.5,0.4924294054508209
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5018599033355713
1,0,okay . okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide .,15,0.5,0.5543212890625
1,0,"yeah , that 's right . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5359418988227844
1,0,this is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion .,15,0.5,0.5776891112327576
0,0,so we can that 's right . yep .,15,0.5,0.474910169839859
1,0,"okay , next . uh that finished ?",15,0.5,0.5820140242576599
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4368588924407959
1,0,no ?,15,0.5,0.6133664846420288
0,0,no no . components .,15,0.5,0.48195433616638184
0,0,components ?,15,0.5,0.42166271805763245
1,0,"yeah . so , will you go to the next slide ?",15,0.5,0.5642842054367065
1,0,yes sure .,15,0.5,0.5668087005615234
0,0,"yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . we are having a power button and the switch , which is not much ,",15,0.5,0.42631885409355164
1,0,and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . and then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time .,15,0.5,0.6246550679206848
0,0,"so we could not put that . so now where the a_s_r_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . so there is a_s_r_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . and then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .",15,0.5,0.3597898483276367
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6750024557113647
1,0,so this is the easiest design the there could be . so th an a_s_r_ decoder we can have things in . to have different technologies . so this was the my personal preference was that we can have a_s_r_ sitting there on the remote control .,15,0.5,0.5100868344306946
0,0,"you know i guess you could actually train the remote control as you 're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button",15,0.5,0.3738161027431488
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5136779546737671
1,0,"like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing",15,0.5,0.6544530987739563
0,0,yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up .,15,0.5,0.4123784601688385
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.48154598474502563
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6319599151611328
1,0,so these are the slight problems .,15,0.5,0.6426224112510681
1,0,so your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?,15,0.5,0.5790274739265442
0,0,"because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though i do n't have much idea , but as he the uh marketing expert presentation was",15,0.5,0.3786807060241699
1,0,i 'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will s will buy it .,15,0.5,0.5832706093788147
0,0,actually i 'm not so sure,15,0.5,0.3655160069465637
1,0,so if we go with just the,15,0.5,0.5255195498466492
1,0,because i 'm the,15,0.5,0.5017511248588562
0,0,i 'm sure .,15,0.5,0.4431895911693573
1,0,"you know if i was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because i ca n't hear it very well , i do n't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when i 'm when i 'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control . you know if there 's some there 's some dialogue all of a sudden that i ca n't hear , i 'm trying to actually find out what 's being said ,",15,0.5,0.6044964790344238
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.34426552057266235
1,0,so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .,15,0.5,0.5895417332649231
0,0,okay so,15,0.5,0.4618189036846161
0,0,"yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it 's about",15,0.5,0.40299057960510254
1,0,well it depends if it 's a remote control th,15,0.5,0.6781505346298218
0,0,"it 's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that .",15,0.5,0.28732767701148987
1,0,"maybe if the remote control is something that y you do n't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion .",15,0.5,0.7376860976219177
0,0,"if you can leave it sitting on the table and you do n't actually have to find it , then that could be .",15,0.5,0.3551165461540222
1,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5729393362998962
0,0,"okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now .",15,0.5,0.43612682819366455
1,1,okay .,15,0.5,0.5160977244377136
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5824154615402222
1,0,"so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we 've taken . uh i will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will uh show us the various investigation they 've done during uh previous uh hours . we 'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have a simple interface . we also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . we have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no l_c_d_ no voice features . so now uh we will have three presentations . so the conceptual specification by industrial designer , the specification of the u_i_ by or u_i_",15,0.5,0.5013835430145264
1,0,abdul al-hasred is my name .,15,0.5,0.5186458230018616
1,0,okay . and uh the last point is uh trend watching by market expert . so maybe we can start with uh industrial design . so this is the presentation .,15,0.5,0.5252586007118225
0,0,"uh , i_d_ you want ?",15,0.5,0.49235618114471436
1,0,maybe i can switch slide uh on your request .,15,0.5,0.5965955257415771
0,0,"yeah . i only v have three slides , so . i just look at the mm um just this . on some web pages to find some documentation",15,0.5,0.45750147104263306
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6797252297401428
1,1,"right . okay , uh if we 're still all with us . right okay , so . work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price . that information has come from our marketing manager here .",15,0.5,0.5248445272445679
1,0,mm-hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6353083848953247
1,0,"so we 're looking to sell internationally , not just in europe . we 're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half euro per unit . and therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it 's uh because obviously you 're gon na have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit . and so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we 're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time .",15,0.5,0.5746292471885681
0,1,", advanced chip . and then we get to the point of the case . um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . uh if we wan na choose for wood or the black and grey . or both ? um as we saw there is not yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce .",15,0.5,0.4382588267326355
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.42028695344924927
1,0,"um but i think it will attract elderly people who wan na have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids .",15,0.5,0.59968101978302
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4291064143180847
1,0,"look i 've got a new remote control , and uh",15,0.5,0.6003270149230957
1,0,uh i dunno .,15,0.5,0.5688435435295105
0,0,"well and i think most important factor there is the wooden colour . so it would n't actually have to be wood ,",15,0.5,0.415151447057724
1,0,yeah . that 's right .,15,0.5,0.5494313836097717
1,0,if it 's just,15,0.5,0.5623412728309631
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.41427552700042725
1,0,wood-coloured .,15,0.5,0.5161013007164001
1,0,but with colour was a lot more expensive ? or ?,15,0.5,0.5315608978271484
0,0,mm i dunno .,15,0.5,0.4039395749568939
0,0,you do n't know ?,15,0.5,0.4512215852737427
1,0,i 'll have to uh research .,15,0.5,0.5985462665557861
0,0,i think so because yeah .,15,0.5,0.4523178040981293
1,0,probably .,15,0.5,0.5089492201805115
1,0,it 's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape .,15,0.5,0.5545351505279541
0,0,"mm . uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . so um uh you 'cause uh yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it .",15,0.5,0.45331594347953796
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5503911375999451
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.6282526850700378
0,0,change the cases . yeah .,15,0.5,0.4301135540008545
0,0,"maybe it 's possible uh possibility . so um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh",15,0.5,0.48085737228393555
0,0,you can sell the cases .,15,0.5,0.4147797226905823
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4309231638908386
1,0,"yeah . i think that 's a very good option . because um then you can advertise as well with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever .",15,0.5,0.5978245735168457
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4128250479698181
1,0,"because that 's a it 's something extra , it 's something other remotes do n't have ,",15,0.5,0.6155446171760559
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.47151923179626465
0,0,which we can get a great advantage point .,15,0.5,0.495389461517334
1,0,yeah that is true .,15,0.5,0.628271222114563
0,0,"so and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as well .",15,0.5,0.42600613832473755
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7059307098388672
1,0,yeah . we would have to look carefully into the design though .,15,0.5,0.5622931718826294
0,0,costs .,15,0.5,0.49304449558258057
1,0,"'cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one .",15,0.5,0.5961214900016785
0,0,yeah . yeah . so,15,0.5,0.451307475566864
0,0,so that would,15,0.5,0.4829961359500885
1,0,"you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example .",15,0.5,0.5161875486373901
0,0,well i would n't design a telephone,15,0.5,0.33932259678840637
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.6136528849601746
0,0,"well no i think w we should just , we should then just design one um",15,0.5,0.41276735067367554
1,0,remote .,15,0.5,0.6066771149635315
0,0,"one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .",15,0.5,0.40654703974723816
0,0,yeah . okay .,15,0.5,0.48184388875961304
0,0,"so , but that should n't be too much of a problem .",15,0.5,0.3693775236606598
1,0,so everybody 's okay with the changing covers ? i think that 's a good uh good option .,15,0.5,0.6456020474433899
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5526513457298279
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4742858111858368
1,0,changing case covers .,15,0.5,0.7221342921257019
0,0,"um i heard our industrial designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved .",15,0.5,0.3140360116958618
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5986354947090149
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5601025819778442
0,0,could you explain that a little more ?,15,0.5,0.4832327961921692
1,0,"well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight .",15,0.5,0.6247920393943787
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4344925582408905
1,0,and uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .,15,0.5,0.6493800282478333
1,0,and what would single curved and double curved mean ?,15,0.5,0.6020945310592651
0,0,"um it would just only affect the form , for as far as i know . so it 's j really just up to the design department what we 're gon na use . it does n't really matter for the price or the functionality .",15,0.5,0.40455925464630127
1,0,okay . so we can pretty much just do whatever we want .,15,0.5,0.500823438167572
1,0,"pick one you like , yes .",15,0.5,0.5734768509864807
0,0,mm . okay .,15,0.5,0.4626512825489044
1,0,'kay . that 's good .,15,0.5,0.5340331792831421
1,0,uh but the form has to be um it has to it 's has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ?,15,0.5,0.5209600925445557
0,0,no just to lie down .,15,0.5,0.42682409286499023
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.445347398519516
1,0,and the the cover of the the docking station is also,15,0.5,0.6387279629707336
0,0,we 'll go for that .,15,0.5,0.49920544028282166
0,0,on top of the television then ? or not ?,15,0.5,0.46021169424057007
1,0,well or besides it .,15,0.5,0.7562738656997681
0,0,and you can just yeah then click it in . that 's okay . um so the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the,15,0.5,0.48880231380462646
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4810527265071869
1,0,on the the board .,15,0.5,0.569214403629303
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.32334357500076294
1,0,does somebody have ideas for a form or,15,0.5,0.5341081619262695
1,0,"uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it 's um not quite uh fancy . so um yeah .",15,0.5,0.5551325082778931
0,0,"um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side ,",15,0.5,0.4446416199207306
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5966545939445496
0,0,"so you could , so your thumb would be easily",15,0.5,0.4163687229156494
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4894205927848816
1,0,well uh i think that was a very good point 'cause i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause r_s_i_ .,15,0.5,0.7181508541107178
0,0,so that would be great for that . um i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .,15,0.5,0.34798139333724976
0,0,for uh uh for,15,0.5,0.4011169672012329
1,0,for left-handed users also .,15,0.5,0.5996268391609192
1,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.5119587182998657
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.42780646681785583
1,0,"mm . yeah we is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? and on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? or or is n't it ?",15,0.5,0.643160879611969
1,0,for the volume . um well,15,0.5,0.5598216652870178
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5326092839241028
0,0,"that could yeah we could do that but i 'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .",15,0.5,0.3852393329143524
1,0,"usabili yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult ,",15,0.5,0.5995805263519287
1,0,yeah okay .,15,0.5,0.5619346499443054
1,0,and then it 's,15,0.5,0.5470741391181946
1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.5626093745231628
1,0,"but if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote .",15,0.5,0.5691282153129578
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.2901054322719574
1,0,'cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff .,15,0.5,0.6264463663101196
0,0,yeah,15,0.5,0.45725199580192566
0,0,but you have extra buttons .,15,0.5,0.4439455270767212
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.4516581594944
1,0,so people can get confused .,15,0.5,0.5883715748786926
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.46616628766059875
1,0,that is true .,15,0.5,0.5351055860519409
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5806618332862854
1,0,especially if they have the same writings on it .,15,0.5,0.6180685758590698
0,0,see um yeah . or we have to make a left uh for lefties,15,0.5,0.4409598112106323
1,0,ca n't we make uh ca n't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same,15,0.5,0.6709082126617432
0,0,and um,15,0.5,0.45818451046943665
1,0,functions as the normal one ?,15,0.5,0.5149457454681396
0,0,you mean um,15,0.5,0.4397900402545929
1,0,then you have to,15,0.5,0.5008869171142578
1,0,yeah if,15,0.5,0.584420382976532
0,0,let 's see if i ca a blank one . and then you get here 's a little l_c_d_ screen . uh now i have to think . it 's a plus and a min . no it 's not very handy i think . because the plus and the min will be opposite,15,0.5,0.4958193004131317
1,0,mm no .,15,0.5,0.505171537399292
1,0,and all kinds of,15,0.5,0.5147479176521301
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5788657069206238
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6110040545463562
1,0,no that 's not gon na work . i guess . maybe we should,15,0.5,0.6172174215316772
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.5674836039543152
0,0,yeah . but is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? i think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel,15,0.5,0.46159839630126953
1,0,yeah . that is true .,15,0.5,0.6835119128227234
1,0,or,15,0.5,0.5618136525154114
0,0,yeah . it 's just uh u using uh your thumb .,15,0.5,0.4885908365249634
1,0,y yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5633630156517029
1,0,so um it 's,15,0.5,0.5354595184326172
1,0,i think we could just uh leave it a normal shape .,15,0.5,0.5024580359458923
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6089764833450317
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6111873984336853
1,0,uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . in one or ano another way .,15,0.5,0.5653498768806458
1,0,yeah . um,15,0.5,0.6774977445602417
0,0,i think we should start by by choosing a case . because that 's the basis you 're building on .,15,0.5,0.4923229515552521
0,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.4800626039505005
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5887088179588318
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5839577913284302
1,0,um yeah,15,0.5,0.6100142002105713
1,0,so i could draw them out .,15,0.5,0.55682373046875
1,0,just,15,0.5,0.5621451735496521
1,0,let 's look at the flat case . oh . it 's from the side so it 's rather normal .,15,0.5,0.5307843089103699
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4505283832550049
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5005069375038147
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.649093747138977
1,0,"the the single curved so i 'm not really sure what they 're gon na look like , but i think it 's something like this . so this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .",15,0.5,0.5204088091850281
0,0,easier ?,15,0.5,0.4984820783138275
1,0,and the double curved s looks something like this i guess .,15,0.5,0.5821841359138489
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.37464985251426697
1,0,so th those are the three options we have .,15,0.5,0.5367412567138672
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.4797461926937103
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4461911618709564
0,0,"i suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in .",15,0.5,0.4176498055458069
1,0,"uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it 's a bit , it has a bit of a angle .",15,0.5,0.594225287437439
1,0,so um do you say this um s uh uh you got like uh sort of a i believe there ?,15,0.5,0.5635073781013489
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5583304166793823
1,0,so um you want to put a display over here ? or not ?,15,0.5,0.5087013244628906
1,0,yeah . i think so . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5667562484741211
1,0,yeah . um yeah . uh,15,0.5,0.6172373294830322
1,0,but now it 's,15,0.5,0.5685006380081177
1,0,we can make it um,15,0.5,0.5278711915016174
1,0,do you have it upside down or,15,0.5,0.531735360622406
0,0,mm ?,15,0.5,0.4124745726585388
1,0,do you have it,15,0.5,0.5550956130027771
0,0,that 's the top .,15,0.5,0.4559193253517151
1,0,this that 's top ? okay .,15,0.5,0.537020206451416
1,0,so uh this top . this down . um maybe it 's possible to uh make this side like um let 's see . um colour uh okay . uh to make this side um like mm the right colour .,15,0.5,0.5054414868354797
1,0,um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . so um uh it 's an,15,0.5,0.500761866569519
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5562329888343811
1,0,so so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . so uh it 's possib um yeah for s so and,15,0.5,0.5294667482376099
1,0,so get your mouse . yeah .,15,0.5,0.594282865524292
1,0,and to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh,15,0.5,0.5124136209487915
1,0,yeah . that 's a good one . but i think it 's better to put the screen uh on top .,15,0.5,0.5409719347953796
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6428958773612976
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6030166149139404
1,0,uh rem,15,0.5,0.5692391991615295
1,0,so just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here .,15,0.5,0.6162240505218506
1,0,yeah but this place um,15,0.5,0.5103699564933777
1,0,"if you can have this one , you turn it like this . and then flip it upside down .",15,0.5,0.5363466739654541
1,0,uh it 's yeah i dunno um,15,0.5,0.5441064834594727
0,0,"because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .",15,0.5,0.45563825964927673
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5928598046302795
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6024635434150696
0,0,it 's more logical to have it on top as well,15,0.5,0.4241914451122284
1,0,i think i,15,0.5,0.5357303619384766
1,0,"because , like on your mobile phone , it 's always above .",15,0.5,0.6007214188575745
0,0,yeah so,15,0.5,0.49838849902153015
0,0,on top .,15,0.5,0.4284866452217102
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6853808760643005
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5188376307487488
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5503084063529968
1,0,oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page .,15,0.5,0.5590303540229797
1,0,. so,15,0.5,0.5566684603691101
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5867797136306763
1,0,then we get here 's that 's the curve .,15,0.5,0.5062060356140137
1,0,five minutes .,15,0.5,0.5283029675483704
0,0,"here the display , and then buttons . yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . just that 's for left hand and right hand users .",15,0.5,0.42986658215522766
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6033162474632263
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5434641242027283
1,0,and then h the rest of the buttons over here .,15,0.5,0.5006304979324341

1,1,okay . good afternoon again .,15,0.5,0.6032575964927673
1,0,"so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . um so here is the agenda for today . uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we 'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we 'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh euro . okay . so let 's go . uh if i go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through th uh w we took this following decisions . no l_c_d_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . we went through the use of wheels and but buttons . and also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . okay . um . good . so guys let this uh wonderful thing .",15,0.5,0.5128624439239502

1,0,"you can pull it out first , maybe .",15,0.5,0.6289851069450378
1,0,we 've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh,15,0.5,0.5251851081848145
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5738512873649597
1,0,"bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it 's not gon na tip over and um this is the remote itself , it 's kind of it 's it 's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . we 've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally .",15,0.5,0.5388793349266052
0,0,what 's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?,15,0.5,0.4414479732513428

0,0,ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops .,15,0.5,0.45440638065338135
1,0,yeah . well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . but normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture .,15,0.5,0.5981078147888184
1,0,uh,15,0.5,0.5050300359725952
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.6683104038238525

0,0,also the top of the banana .,15,0.5,0.4450918734073639
0,0,excellent .,15,0.5,0.43203800916671753
1,0,so . and then we have,15,0.5,0.5283693671226501
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5774957537651062
1,0,in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana .,15,0.5,0.5818793177604675
0,0,calling . excellent .,15,0.5,0.3454635441303253
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7697972655296326
0,0,and the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?,15,0.5,0.49186503887176514
0,0,actually they do .,15,0.5,0.3876335024833679
1,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.5667425394058228
0,0,that 's that 's yeah that 's uh that 's form and function in the one in the one uh object .,15,0.5,0.46358656883239746
1,0,"yeah . so it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage .",15,0.5,0.6327984929084778
0,0,it 's like antennas .,15,0.5,0.45662829279899597
0,0,yeah . so .,15,0.5,0.4520382881164551
1,0,but yeah that 's um that 's just like that 's an attractive um base station .,15,0.5,0.6207766532897949
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.4986589252948761
1,0,so .,15,0.5,0.5287995338439941
0,0,"so , what else ?",15,0.5,0.45643752813339233
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4331967830657959
1,0,and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries .,15,0.5,0.6603994369506836
0,0,is it really weight ? is it light or,15,0.5,0.3596919775009155
0,0,it is very light .,15,0.5,0.49808469414711
1,0,"yeah , they 're light .",15,0.5,0.6992910504341125
0,0,it 's it 's uh it 's about the weight of a banana .,15,0.5,0.4511566460132599
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.43025439977645874
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6756829619407654
0,0,"you know , to give you the correct look and feel .",15,0.5,0.46473774313926697
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4993002712726593
1,0,ok,15,0.5,0.6044111847877502
0,0,and we have put these different colours so that people do n't mistake them mistake it as a banana .,15,0.5,0.40397948026657104
1,0,otherwise it 's you know a child comes and so,15,0.5,0.5476430654525757
0,0,"okay . yeah yeah yeah , i see . i under i understand .",15,0.5,0.35354647040367126
1,0,"i think a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should",15,0.5,0.6270883083343506
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6007730960845947
1,0,consider that . maybe health and safety aspects .,15,0.5,0.5097723603248596
0,0,ah yeah .,15,0.5,0.4100699722766876
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5415478348731995
1,0,oh we did n't think of that yet . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5537846684455872
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.45795994997024536
1,0,"so for the power source , apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries .",15,0.5,0.6759386658668518
0,0,oh yeah that 's right .,15,0.5,0.34340590238571167
0,0,uh you mean okay . so,15,0.5,0.4854711890220642
1,0,i do n't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station .,15,0.5,0.6168704032897949
0,0,"yeah , where are going to where are you are you going to place them ?",15,0.5,0.489277720451355
1,0,mm-hmm mm-hmm . it 'll it 'll be always at top somewhere at there .,15,0.5,0.6140003204345703
0,0,if i was gon na place them i 'd put them on the on the top here since that 's like uh the black bit,15,0.5,0.3705872893333435
1,0,you have enough surface ? you,15,0.5,0.5476782917976379
0,0,but yeah i do n't i really do n't think it 's necessary to have the solar cells anymore .,15,0.5,0.48908182978630066
0,0,yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries,15,0.5,0.470199316740036
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4022993743419647
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.42135271430015564
1,0,so that that is .,15,0.5,0.555267870426178
0,0,what will be the autonomy ? roughly ?,15,0.5,0.4856208264827728
1,0,the what sorry ?,15,0.5,0.5874767303466797
1,0,the autonomy . autonomy .,15,0.5,0.5093991756439209
1,0,what do you mean ?,15,0.5,0.5002362132072449
1,0,uh i mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?,15,0.5,0.5337228178977966
1,0,how long the how long the bit the batteries long .,15,0.5,0.5201606750488281
1,0,ah . ah . a long time .,15,0.5,0.5265561938285828
1,0,yeah . a long,15,0.5,0.539053201675415
1,0,"no no no ,",15,0.5,0.5597192049026489
0,0,eight to ten eight to ten hours .,15,0.5,0.42671605944633484
1,0,it can it should be weeks .,15,0.5,0.6765508651733398
0,0,n most no most of the time it 's not being used .,15,0.5,0.4076482355594635
0,0,"yeah , so it 's",15,0.5,0.4177018702030182
1,0,yeah but y people do n't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wan na leave it on the couch so,15,0.5,0.6590594053268433
0,0,so when when you are making it on,15,0.5,0.39400044083595276
1,0,it 's used only when you,15,0.5,0.562842845916748
0,0,mm . mm-hmm . no eight or eight or ten hours of working .,15,0.5,0.4159095287322998
1,0,"ah , okay .",15,0.5,0.5196162462234497
0,0,if you are just leaving like that it 'll be much longer .,15,0.5,0.4794982373714447
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4333576560020447
1,0,yeah . f weeks .,15,0.5,0.60773104429245
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4260849058628082
1,0,yeah . that 's right .,15,0.5,0.5859485864639282
1,0,right . next slide ?,15,0.5,0.6437310576438904
0,0,yeah . and we are having the speakers regular chip for control . pricing is was a factor so that 's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . and uh that 's it .,15,0.5,0.48008450865745544
1,0,okay . okay . those really sounds very good .,15,0.5,0.5326862931251526
1,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.5119718909263611
1,0,nothing else to add ?,15,0.5,0.5763006806373596
0,0,it seems to be falling over .,15,0.5,0.4742113947868347
1,0,i l yeah .,15,0.5,0.5523085594177246
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6071833968162537
0,0,i like i like it . maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons . looks a bit,15,0.5,0.4711955189704895
0,0,you want to have more functional buttons ?,15,0.5,0.49210914969444275
0,0,looks a bit puzzled uh i dunno how to say that .,15,0.5,0.4925352931022644
1,0,you are not convinced .,15,0.5,0.6968582272529602
0,0,you the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it 's teletext or not,15,0.5,0.4808519780635834
0,0,"not not many , we we want to keep it simple . so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons .",15,0.5,0.39289212226867676
1,0,and the volume button will will become,15,0.5,0.6215564012527466
1,0,"it 's up to you , means .",15,0.5,0.5095956921577454
0,0,"well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext .",15,0.5,0.43225765228271484
1,0,now that means let 's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .,15,0.5,0.5957006812095642
0,0,or can move between positions in the in the number .,15,0.5,0.49343952536582947
0,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.44060254096984863
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5330561399459839
1,0,and what about people who want to use digits ? butto real buttons ?,15,0.5,0.6149557828903198
0,0,wow .,15,0.5,0.4736771881580353
1,0,yeah . so there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .,15,0.5,0.5156667828559875
0,0,"so we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they do n't care about the buttons any more . and anyway",15,0.5,0.3605893850326538
1,0,okay . because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ?,15,0.5,0.5359508395195007
0,0,it 's all automatic .,15,0.5,0.3860968053340912
1,0,it 's all automatic .,15,0.5,0.5721520185470581
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4243318736553192
1,0,okay . okay yeah it 's fine .,15,0.5,0.6208972334861755
1,0,very good uh yeah,15,0.5,0.6338101625442505
1,0,w we are living in a wonderful world .,15,0.5,0.554179847240448
1,0,you th yeah .,15,0.5,0.5762578248977661
1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.6693472266197205
0,0,bananas everywhere .,15,0.5,0.42587167024612427
0,0,"okay , so",15,0.5,0.3549618124961853
1,0,automatically configure .,15,0.5,0.6751498579978943
0,0,so we have to go through now evaluations .,15,0.5,0.28368479013442993
1,0,evalua yeah .,15,0.5,0.6603078842163086
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5847678184509277
1,0,so your slides are ready ?,15,0.5,0.5509194135665894
1,0,s,15,0.5,0.565649151802063
0,0,uh you 're four i think .,15,0.5,0.4840852618217468
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5481021404266357
1,0,"so this is one , which one is this one ?",15,0.5,0.5088207721710205
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5813970565795898
1,0,okay . i i const i constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . and each criteria is will be evaluated it 's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it 's true or is or if it 's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven .,15,0.5,0.5735307931900024
1,0,why this strange factor of seven ?,15,0.5,0.6058613061904907
0,0,because i i 'm sorry . sorry .,15,0.5,0.3468847870826721
1,0,usually i have seen that scales are from one to ten .,15,0.5,0.5338488221168518
0,0,"ah yeah . it 's from sorry , it 's from one to seven . it 's from from one to seven sorry . because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale ,",15,0.5,0.4314229190349579
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4821685254573822
0,0,num number,15,0.5,0.4650258719921112
1,0,okay . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6080949306488037
0,0,and five is too short and nine is too long .,15,0.5,0.4618026316165924
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5354463458061218
0,0,i 'm a i i 'm,15,0.5,0.49925902485847473
1,0,"okay fine , got the idea .",15,0.5,0.5778586268424988
1,0,so to have in order to have enough granularity,15,0.5,0.5089898705482483
1,0,sorry ?,15,0.5,0.6181591749191284
0,0,it 's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation .,15,0.5,0.42906463146209717
1,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.585000216960907
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5728151798248291
0,0,the variance is mi it 's is minimal .,15,0.5,0.4621165692806244
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5352833271026611
0,0,"okay , okay , great .",15,0.5,0.49183574318885803
1,0,i 'm um answering your question .,15,0.5,0.5294196009635925
0,0,okay . yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.47915035486221313
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5594771504402161
1,0,go ahead .,15,0.5,0.5662344694137573
0,0,and that 's the criteria i i found more useful . i think i sh i i could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?,15,0.5,0.39767247438430786
1,0,mm-hmm . sure .,15,0.5,0.6416851878166199
0,0,and we all four could range,15,0.5,0.4645395576953888
1,0,okay . yeah yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5944100618362427
0,0,could evaluate the,15,0.5,0.4902835190296173
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.537298858165741
1,0,"so you can say fancy , handy . handy .",15,0.5,0.5341876745223999
0,0,okay let 's let 's evaluate if it 's fancy or,15,0.5,0.49884065985679626
1,0,"yeah , it 's fancy , according to me .",15,0.5,0.5795467495918274
1,0,seven but,15,0.5,0.5297671556472778
1,0,"yeah , six .",15,0.5,0.5385918617248535
1,0,s seven .,15,0.5,0.6188351511955261
1,0,seven . seven by me .,15,0.5,0.5106222033500671
1,0,six .,15,0.5,0.5279461741447449
0,0,i would say seven .,15,0.5,0.4559544622898102
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5365403890609741
1,0,it 's quite fancy .,15,0.5,0.5345290303230286
0,0,so you can add seven plus six plus seven plus,15,0.5,0.45576855540275574
1,0,"no , wait .",15,0.5,0.5093193650245667
1,0,yeah uh five .,15,0.5,0.5865903496742249
1,0,what do you say seven ? five ?,15,0.5,0.5570259690284729
0,0,five .,15,0.5,0.4549914598464966
0,0,"five , maybe maybe maybe six it 's it 's i guess it 's",15,0.5,0.4941159188747406
1,0,"okay , six point five .",15,0.5,0.5686017870903015
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.563607394695282
1,0,handy ?,15,0.5,0.5578209161758423
1,0,again i 'll give seven .,15,0.5,0.5278126001358032
1,0,seven .,15,0.5,0.6198848485946655
0,0,"i 'd give it a six like i 'd i think it 's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels",15,0.5,0.46540579199790955
1,0,six .,15,0.5,0.5852594971656799
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.33562734723091125
1,0,but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote .,15,0.5,0.6880309581756592
0,0,"so seven , seven ,",15,0.5,0.4296916425228119
1,0,seven for me .,15,0.5,0.5272800922393799
0,0,"six ,",15,0.5,0.49994248151779175
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5809131860733032
1,0,six .,15,0.5,0.5153238773345947
1,0,six point five . functional .,15,0.5,0.58978670835495
1,0,i 'll give five .,15,0.5,0.5105551481246948
1,0,four .,15,0.5,0.5274056792259216
1,0,i would say,15,0.5,0.5277460217475891
0,0,"well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ?",15,0.5,0.47217562794685364
1,0,everything ar,15,0.5,0.537117600440979

1,0,i want i want to market it as exclusive . so i would market this product it at eighty-nine euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but i do n't think we have that flexibility .,15,0.5,0.5784034729003906
1,0,"but i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard t_v_ so the place uh remote the then the place we 're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high-priced basic remote . does that make sense , huh ?",15,0.5,0.5003481507301331

1,0,yeah we probably should .,15,0.5,0.6055266857147217

1,0,we we 're doing alright for time .,15,0.5,0.6114455461502075

1,0,okay . sorry that kinda cut into you there .,15,0.5,0.5754709839820862

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3710363507270813

0,0,yeah mm .,15,0.5,0.39240288734436035

1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.6762046217918396
0,0,i think technology we 'd we we 're not in the price range to do it . we do n't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design .,15,0.5,0.43978649377822876

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6789491176605225

1,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5168569087982178
1,0,we 'll use the the basic functions for a television . no teletext . um okay hold on .,15,0.5,0.5753958821296692
0,0,"although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap .",15,0.5,0.49077609181404114

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6355570554733276
1,0,so sorta strike a balance between a a few and a,15,0.5,0.5592690706253052
1,0,well,15,0.5,0.6444368958473206
1,0,or it looks like we 're just cutting on the um,15,0.5,0.5225935578346252
1,0,"mm . on the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff .",15,0.5,0.505770742893219

0,0,"mm-hmm , okay . okay , cool .",15,0.5,0.42404434084892273
1,0,"uh maybe raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they 'll send",15,0.5,0.5918977856636047

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4166152775287628
1,0,okay um . so uh i take it your position arlo is that the bells and whistles we 've got ta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick .,15,0.5,0.5002236366271973
1,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.5195606350898743
1,0,"um so i mean a a the sort of inkling i 'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that i 'm getting sent is that they 're quite interested in a t_f_t_ display , interactive display . however that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry raj um said people did n't like . although i guess if there 's a sort of",15,0.5,0.5342487096786499
1,0,"mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.591934084892273

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7417129874229431
0,0,"but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple .",15,0.5,0.4012887179851532
1,0,yeah . okay .,15,0.5,0.6764260530471802

1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.5734331011772156
0,0,glow in the dark material i was thinking .,15,0.5,0.39229875802993774
1,0,okay . so,15,0.5,0.5737894773483276
1,0,i,15,0.5,0.5303353071212769
1,0,"um , so i i guess that would be cheaper than a light i think .",15,0.5,0.5082367062568665
1,0,uh may i say something about ?,15,0.5,0.5449635982513428
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.4720001220703125
1,0,"uh actually i think it 's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . but",15,0.5,0.6450510025024414
0,0,"often lost s was that ,",15,0.5,0.414475679397583

1,0,"lost , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6074827313423157
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5350011587142944
1,0,"and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . but if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control ,",15,0.5,0.5987610220909119
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.38908645510673523

0,0,that 's cool .,15,0.5,0.44281652569770813

1,0,that 's cool .,15,0.5,0.5756306052207947
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4789598882198334
1,0,so we should take it into consideration also .,15,0.5,0.5382841229438782
1,0,"okay , cool .",15,0.5,0.5845556259155273
0,0,well hmm .,15,0.5,0.2841070890426636
1,0,um speech recognition i take it,15,0.5,0.7482538819313049
0,0,oh it 's,15,0.5,0.28879451751708984
0,0,"i do n't , i 've i know of no products um that use speech recognition well .",15,0.5,0.49594640731811523
1,0,they 're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . you could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh b_b_c_ one and it goes to that channel .,15,0.5,0.535171627998352
1,0,really ?,15,0.5,0.5160014033317566
0,0,"yeah , it did n't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . they mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to b_b_c_ one .",15,0.5,0.4732360243797302
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.646205723285675
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.426440566778183
1,0,"yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for b_b_c_ two on b_b_c_ one 'll switch the channel for you kinda thing .",15,0.5,0.5608974099159241
1,0,"right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you 'd be watching the t_v_ and then all of a sudden it 'd it 'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something ,",15,0.5,0.5846388339996338
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.46057215332984924
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6141057014465332
0,0,but if you can work around that that noise problem,15,0.5,0.3968026041984558
1,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.6629025936126709
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.5285300612449646
1,0,well what about,15,0.5,0.5314815640449524
0,0,"this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that 's built into the t_v_ um that you can press and it 'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we ca n't hear or something",15,0.5,0.49889713525772095
0,0,"ah , that 's a good idea .",15,0.5,0.4828813076019287
1,0,um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .,15,0.5,0.585625946521759
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5320330262184143
1,0,so like a kind of backwards remote from the telly .,15,0.5,0.660038948059082
1,0,if you find if y,15,0.5,0.5791907906532288
0,0,"right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise .",15,0.5,0.34821829199790955
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5446308851242065
1,0,"what you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the t_v_ speaker , or not a remo i 'm sorry , a microphone by the t_v_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you ca n't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their t_v_s .",15,0.5,0.6219523549079895
0,0,"mm . yeah , that 's the only thing , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4176577925682068
1,0,"but yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the t_v_ speaker",15,0.5,0.528144359588623
1,0,"that we should just stick on , yeah .",15,0.5,0.606561005115509
0,0,which,15,0.5,0.4245809018611908
1,0,that comes with our remote control .,15,0.5,0.5275596976280212
0,0,"right , and then the remote control would know um what 's being produced by the television .",15,0.5,0.46429628133773804
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3883723020553589
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6820994019508362
1,0,and that 's a sort of basic r_f_ kind of frequency so it 'll be cheap .,15,0.5,0.5424600839614868
1,0,"right , right .",15,0.5,0.5847897529602051
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5219222903251648
1,0,"right , right . um . yeah that 's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . if you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you do n't even need to find it . you just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the t_v_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it 's within you know , within hearing range . and uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you 've no idea where it is and it would still do its job .",15,0.5,0.5721881985664368
0,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.3813728988170624
1,0,"that could also be built into the t_v_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete .",15,0.5,0.5801219940185547
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4748695194721222
0,0,"well , hopefully we 're uh we 're ahead of the curve .",15,0.5,0.4892120361328125
0,0,it might do us out of a job .,15,0.5,0.3905148506164551
1,0,"yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.6154220700263977
1,0,"um okay . i like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . um so i think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that ,",15,0.5,0.6330878138542175
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3983386158943176
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4110829532146454
1,0,so i th,15,0.5,0.6916160583496094
1,0,and the expense .,15,0.5,0.5037088394165039
1,0,yeah and expense and the time .,15,0.5,0.5760197639465332
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6436722874641418
0,0,so i think if we 're going to go well i mean like the thing about the there 's the problem with the t_f_t_ or the l_c_d_ kind of thing is if you 're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen .,15,0.5,0.489368736743927
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5214278697967529
1,0,"um , but i guess not i thin we 'll just we 'll just pretend that 's not a problem . um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? is that",15,0.5,0.5559221506118774
1,0,um .,15,0.5,0.6634480953216553
0,0,maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that 's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour .,15,0.5,0.49819546937942505
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4351259171962738
0,0,contrast contra well .,15,0.5,0.4526544213294983
0,0,"yeah , no th the material 's cheap but it 's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then uh if you 're , if you 're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it wo n't glow any more .",15,0.5,0.4398314654827118
1,0,"yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.6253130435943604
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5667330026626587
0,0,so if it 's dow it 's d uh yeah . or if it 's down under the couch cushions,15,0.5,0.4896339178085327
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.685493528842926
1,0,um which is where i usually find mine .,15,0.5,0.527133584022522
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5491743683815002
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.567537248134613
0,0,"um okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially ,",15,0.5,0.4069795310497284
1,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.6578661799430847
1,0,um if we 're gon na have to,15,0.5,0.5576779842376709
1,0,"'cause what i thought , main",15,0.5,0.5999741554260254
0,0,"if we 're gon na have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um slogan .",15,0.5,0.39568227529525757
1,0,"slogan , yeah .",15,0.5,0.7098535895347595
0,0,"uh then you know they 're gon na be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .",15,0.5,0.4738101661205292
1,0,"right . mm-hmm . 'cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you 're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control .",15,0.5,0.6052080392837524
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5376675128936768
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4361303150653839
1,0,"alright , so n sorta if if if we 're gon if we 're gon na go with the idea of um uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then .",15,0.5,0.6086927056312561
0,0,that was more of a a gimmick .,15,0.5,0.39564248919487
0,0,do you think ?,15,0.5,0.4795515835285187
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.41482284665107727
1,0,uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then .,15,0.5,0.5285821557044983
1,0,"yeah , unnecessary . yeah .",15,0.5,0.514732301235199
0,0,"okay . um , okay so scratch that . uh so we 've got do we want to go with the t_f_t_ idea or the is that far too expensive ?",15,0.5,0.46975117921829224
1,0,"um yeah we 're getting a lot of features now , i i think",15,0.5,0.5506701469421387
0,0,well i mean i think i think the sort of find the finder things i mean it 's uh i could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself .,15,0.5,0.4969451427459717
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5364894866943359
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.4435398578643799
1,0,"well , i think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around ,",15,0.5,0.6662749648094177
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3722582161426544
1,0,there 's a good chance the the t_f_t_ screen would break or uh get damaged .,15,0.5,0.5423251986503601
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5299929976463318
0,0,they 're pretty fragile .,15,0.5,0.45514288544654846
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5226856470108032
1,0,so is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a t_f_t_ screen ?,15,0.5,0.584502100944519
0,0,"um no , i mean that was going on ravs uh raj 's sort of um marketing research i guess . um uh so we 'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . um . so that 's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um",15,0.5,0.4867285192012787
0,0,yeah mm .,15,0.5,0.4645726978778839
1,0,uh you were finding out about teletext .,15,0.5,0.5225510001182556
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.524885356426239
0,0,if you could find out that uh,15,0.5,0.43509441614151
1,0,"totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi",15,0.5,0.5867666006088257
0,0,um i think we 're gon na scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a,15,0.5,0.38554516434669495
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.4359739422798157
0,0,"um expensive ,",15,0.5,0.4487835764884949
1,0,yeah you think so ?,15,0.5,0.5625389814376831
1,0,"oh no it 's it 's much cheaper than the t_f_t_ , it 's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits .",15,0.5,0.542283296585083
0,0,"no ? oh right , okay .",15,0.5,0.38598859310150146
1,0,"and it 'd it 'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system ,",15,0.5,0.6532431244850159
0,0,is it not the circuits that cost,15,0.5,0.38938868045806885

1,0,yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow well to make a banana,15,0.5,0.5364067554473877
1,0,yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe .,15,0.5,0.52829909324646
1,0,remote okay so we actually have a,15,0.5,0.5701629519462585
1,0,"you can pull it out first , maybe .",15,0.5,0.6289851069450378
1,0,we 've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh,15,0.5,0.5251851081848145
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5738512873649597
1,0,"bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it 's not gon na tip over and um this is the remote itself , it 's kind of it 's it 's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . we 've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally .",15,0.5,0.5388793349266052
0,0,what 's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?,15,0.5,0.4414479732513428
1,0,this is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th,15,0.5,0.5392233729362488
0,0,ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops .,15,0.5,0.4544064700603485
1,0,yeah . well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . but normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture .,15,0.5,0.5981078147888184
1,0,uh,15,0.5,0.5050300359725952
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.6683104038238525
0,0,"and we we do have one more functionality . if you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the t_v_ .",15,0.5,0.4064215421676636
0,0,the t_v_ yeah .,15,0.5,0.4877704679965973
1,0,which one ?,15,0.5,0.5251087546348572
0,0,the s the turbo button .,15,0.5,0.40199869871139526
0,0,the turbo button .,15,0.5,0.33118048310279846
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.593753457069397
0,0,so rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button .,15,0.5,0.38971248269081116
0,0,additional button .,15,0.5,0.4572353661060333
0,0,what this button for ?,15,0.5,0.4455851912498474
0,0,this is a teletext button . so once you press that then you get teletext,15,0.5,0.37075933814048767
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.7010349631309509
0,0,and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh,15,0.5,0.4724886119365692
0,0,to navigate it through th through teletext .,15,0.5,0.430222749710083
1,0,to navigate yeah .,15,0.5,0.5287033915519714
1,0,but if you want to go to page seven hundred ?,15,0.5,0.5570441484451294
1,0,"that 's right , that 's right .",15,0.5,0.5434654951095581
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7168160080909729
1,0,with the wheel it 's easy .,15,0.5,0.6492411494255066
0,0,how man,15,0.5,0.40631139278411865
0,0,"well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing , you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh",15,0.5,0.44572535157203674
1,0,i do n't understand it . can you repeat it ?,15,0.5,0.5288560390472412
0,0,well you can you can press press the teletext button,15,0.5,0.41139551997184753
1,0,and then you then you can you can f,15,0.5,0.6428254246711731
0,0,so then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing .,15,0.5,0.3718721866607666
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6092716455459595

1,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.6078106760978699
1,0,mm uh,15,0.5,0.5729529857635498
0,0,"once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .",15,0.5,0.38498854637145996
1,0,okay . i see . i see . okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5465304851531982
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5769908428192139
1,0,and this is the uh the infrared uh port .,15,0.5,0.5658959746360779
1,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.6692629456520081
0,0,also the top of the banana .,15,0.5,0.4450919032096863
0,0,excellent .,15,0.5,0.43203800916671753
1,0,so . and then we have,15,0.5,0.5283694267272949
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5774957537651062
1,0,in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana .,15,0.5,0.5818793177604675
0,0,calling . excellent .,15,0.5,0.3454635739326477
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7697972059249878
0,0,and the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?,15,0.5,0.49186503887176514
0,0,actually they do .,15,0.5,0.3876335024833679
1,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.5667425394058228
0,0,that 's that 's yeah that 's uh that 's form and function in the one in the one uh object .,15,0.5,0.46358656883239746
1,0,"yeah . so it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage .",15,0.5,0.6327984929084778
0,0,it 's like antennas .,15,0.5,0.45662829279899597
0,0,yeah . so .,15,0.5,0.4520382881164551
1,0,but yeah that 's um that 's just like that 's an attractive um base station .,15,0.5,0.6207766532897949
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.4986589252948761
1,0,so .,15,0.5,0.5287995338439941
0,0,"so , what else ?",15,0.5,0.45643752813339233
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.433198481798172
1,0,and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries .,15,0.5,0.6603980660438538
0,0,is it really weight ? is it light or,15,0.5,0.35969406366348267
0,0,it is very light .,15,0.5,0.49808475375175476
1,0,"yeah , they 're light .",15,0.5,0.6992910504341125
0,0,it 's it 's uh it 's about the weight of a banana .,15,0.5,0.4511566460132599
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.43025439977645874
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6756829619407654
0,0,"you know , to give you the correct look and feel .",15,0.5,0.46473774313926697
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4993002712726593
1,0,ok,15,0.5,0.6044111847877502
0,0,and we have put these different colours so that people do n't mistake them mistake it as a banana .,15,0.5,0.40397948026657104
1,0,otherwise it 's you know a child comes and so,15,0.5,0.5476431250572205
0,0,"okay . yeah yeah yeah , i see . i under i understand .",15,0.5,0.35354647040367126
1,0,"i think a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should",15,0.5,0.6270883083343506
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6007730960845947
1,0,consider that . maybe health and safety aspects .,15,0.5,0.5097723603248596
0,0,ah yeah .,15,0.5,0.4100699722766876
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5415478348731995
1,0,oh we did n't think of that yet . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5537846684455872
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.45795994997024536
1,0,"so for the power source , apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries .",15,0.5,0.6759386658668518
0,0,oh yeah that 's right .,15,0.5,0.34340590238571167
0,0,uh you mean okay . so,15,0.5,0.4854711890220642
1,0,i do n't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station .,15,0.5,0.6168704032897949
0,0,"yeah , where are going to where are you are you going to place them ?",15,0.5,0.489277720451355
1,0,mm-hmm mm-hmm . it 'll it 'll be always at top somewhere at there .,15,0.5,0.6140003800392151
0,0,if i was gon na place them i 'd put them on the on the top here since that 's like uh the black bit,15,0.5,0.3705872893333435
1,0,you have enough surface ? you,15,0.5,0.5476782917976379
0,0,but yeah i do n't i really do n't think it 's necessary to have the solar cells anymore .,15,0.5,0.48908185958862305
0,0,yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries,15,0.5,0.4259108006954193
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4788617789745331
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.42135271430015564
1,0,so that that is .,15,0.5,0.555267870426178
0,0,what will be the autonomy ? roughly ?,15,0.5,0.4856208264827728
1,0,the what sorry ?,15,0.5,0.5874767303466797
1,0,the autonomy . autonomy .,15,0.5,0.5093991756439209
1,0,what do you mean ?,15,0.5,0.5002362132072449
1,0,uh i mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?,15,0.5,0.5337228178977966
1,0,how long the how long the bit the batteries long .,15,0.5,0.5201607346534729
1,0,ah . ah . a long time .,15,0.5,0.5265561938285828
1,0,yeah . a long,15,0.5,0.539053201675415
1,0,"no no no ,",15,0.5,0.5597192049026489
0,0,eight to ten eight to ten hours .,15,0.5,0.4267161190509796
1,0,it can it should be weeks .,15,0.5,0.6765508651733398
0,0,n most no most of the time it 's not being used .,15,0.5,0.4076482355594635
0,0,"yeah , so it 's",15,0.5,0.4177018702030182
1,0,yeah but y people do n't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wan na leave it on the couch so,15,0.5,0.6590594053268433
0,0,so when when you are making it on,15,0.5,0.39400044083595276
1,0,it 's used only when you,15,0.5,0.562842845916748
0,0,mm . mm-hmm . no eight or eight or ten hours of working .,15,0.5,0.4159095287322998
1,0,"ah , okay .",15,0.5,0.5196162462234497
0,0,if you are just leaving like that it 'll be much longer .,15,0.5,0.4794982373714447
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4333576560020447
1,0,yeah . f weeks .,15,0.5,0.60773104429245
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4260849058628082
1,0,yeah . that 's right .,15,0.5,0.5859485864639282
1,0,right . next slide ?,15,0.5,0.6437149047851562
0,0,yeah . and we are having the speakers regular chip for control . pricing is was a factor so that 's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . and uh that 's it .,15,0.5,0.4801323711872101
1,0,okay . okay . those really sounds very good .,15,0.5,0.5326452851295471
1,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.5119718909263611
1,0,nothing else to add ?,15,0.5,0.5763006806373596
0,0,it seems to be falling over .,15,0.5,0.4742113947868347
1,0,i l yeah .,15,0.5,0.5523085594177246
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6071833968162537
0,0,i like i like it . maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons . looks a bit,15,0.5,0.4711954593658447
0,0,you want to have more functional buttons ?,15,0.5,0.4921092092990875
0,0,looks a bit puzzled uh i dunno how to say that .,15,0.5,0.4925352931022644
1,0,you are not convinced .,15,0.5,0.6968581676483154
0,0,you the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it 's teletext or not,15,0.5,0.48085203766822815
0,0,"not not many , we we want to keep it simple . so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons .",15,0.5,0.39289218187332153
1,0,and the volume button will will become,15,0.5,0.6215564012527466
1,0,"it 's up to you , means .",15,0.5,0.5095957517623901
0,0,"well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext .",15,0.5,0.43225765228271484
1,0,now that means let 's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .,15,0.5,0.5957006812095642
0,0,or can move between positions in the in the number .,15,0.5,0.49343958497047424
0,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.4406026005744934
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5330561399459839
1,0,and what about people who want to use digits ? butto real buttons ?,15,0.5,0.6149557828903198
0,0,wow .,15,0.5,0.4736771881580353
1,0,yeah . so there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .,15,0.5,0.5156667828559875
0,0,"so we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they do n't care about the buttons any more . and anyway",15,0.5,0.36058950424194336
1,0,okay . because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ?,15,0.5,0.535950779914856
0,0,it 's all automatic .,15,0.5,0.38609692454338074
1,0,it 's all automatic .,15,0.5,0.5721520185470581
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4243318736553192
1,0,okay . okay yeah it 's fine .,15,0.5,0.6208972334861755

0,0,bananas everywhere .,15,0.5,0.42587170004844666
0,0,"okay , so",15,0.5,0.3549618124961853
1,0,automatically configure .,15,0.5,0.6924644112586975
0,1,"okay . um welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and i hope you all had a good individual working time . okay , let 's get started . okay , here 's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening um i am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we 're gon na have three presentations , one from each of you . then we 're gon na discuss some new project requirements . um gon na come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . and then we 're gon na close up the meeting . and we 're gon na do this all in about forty minutes . okay . first i want to discuss the goals of this meeting . first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . and then we 're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . and then lastly we 're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that 's the whole technical side of 'kay i 'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you 're making some notes .",15,0.5,0.3954907953739166

1,0,okay . great .,15,0.5,0.5750429034233093
0,0,"okay . um well , the function of a remote control , as what uh we 've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it 's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . and then functions for v_h_s_ , d_v_d_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . and enter would be for like , you know , the menus . and then other menus for d_v_ as well as t_v_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .",15,0.5,0.484048455953598
0,0,"and we can decide if that 's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that 's something that would stay on the t_v_ itself , for example .",15,0.5,0.43247783184051514
1,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.562239408493042
0,0,"these are two examples . um and you can see on the left , it 's got a lot more buttons ,",15,0.5,0.4979073703289032
0,0,"and i do n't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . and then on the right , it 's a lot more simpler , it 's got volume , it 's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it 's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . so you have functions that are d uh duplicating .",15,0.5,0.3961641490459442
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5185533165931702
0,0,"and you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . so that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . okay .",15,0.5,0.4856919050216675
1,0,ready .,15,0.5,0.6792802214622498
1,0,"and then lastly , it 's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? and what functions it needs to complete . uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that 's something that also has to be considered and it 's gon na be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place .",15,0.5,0.5080342888832092
1,0,so that 's it .,15,0.5,0.540399432182312

1,0,"okay . um what are we doing next ? uh um . okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . um so according to the brief um we 're gon na be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , um and we 're aiming to make fifty million euro . um so we 're gon na be selling this on an international scale . and uh we do n't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .",15,0.5,0.5306331515312195
0,0,"'kay . um , can we just go over that again ?",15,0.5,0.42771071195602417

1,0,all together .,15,0.5,0.632003903388977

1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.5238199830055237
1,0,i mean do you think the fact that it 's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?,15,0.5,0.5708611607551575
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5183318257331848

0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.2953276038169861
1,0,i suppose it 's depends on how complicated our remote control is .,15,0.5,0.6498734354972839
0,0,i do n't know . yeah .,15,0.5,0.46660760045051575
0,0,"it does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons .",15,0.5,0.4436131715774536
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6027969717979431

1,0,"and then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . i 'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it 'll be different , so",15,0.5,0.5150552988052368
0,0,"what , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ?",15,0.5,0.45109423995018005

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6403844356536865
0,0,"something other than just standard . um so i 'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five euros , is that sort of the thi is this gon na to be like the premium product kinda thing or",15,0.5,0.4548351466655731
1,0,"yeah , yeah . like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .",15,0.5,0.5743577480316162
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.5911645889282227

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5253751873970032
1,0,"mm-hmm . yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , i just do n't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .",15,0.5,0.6010288000106812
0,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.42639002203941345

1,0,"like so sort of like how do you i i mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . or another way is maybe people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .",15,0.5,0.5413959622383118
1,0,i know um my parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .,15,0.5,0.5286151766777039
0,0,but right . right .,15,0.5,0.3332146108150482
1,0,so um for them it was just how many devices control .,15,0.5,0.6769218444824219
0,0,"okay so right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses",15,0.5,0.41459277272224426
1,0,"yeah . right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know ,",15,0.5,0.514784574508667
0,0,i think so .,15,0.5,0.39519202709198
1,0,do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ?,15,0.5,0.5907459855079651
0,0,"yeah , yeah . yeah . well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . they 're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , m_p_ three players , telephones ,",15,0.5,0.49879035353660583
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4771599769592285
1,0,"everything , agenda . so , like , i wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market ,",15,0.5,0.580454409122467
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5447806715965271
1,0,"such as the lighting in your house , or um",15,0.5,0.5256102681159973
0,0,"or even like , you know , notes about um what you wan na watch . like you might put in there oh i want to watch such and such and look a",15,0.5,0.49117064476013184
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6531697511672974
0,0,oh that 's a good idea . so extra functionalities .,15,0.5,0.47164711356163025
1,0,"an yeah . like , p personally for me , at home i 've i 've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player . so they w all work actually function together but i have different remote controls for each of them .",15,0.5,0.5452379584312439
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.35325899720191956
1,0,"so it 's sort of ironic that that then they 're in there um you know , the sound and everything it 's just one system .",15,0.5,0.6408381462097168
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.37267014384269714
1,0,but each one 's got its own little part .,15,0.5,0.5777329206466675
1,0,"um okay , uh i 'd wel we 're gon na have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . um i 'll just check we 've nothing else . okay . um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they do n't like about remote controls they 've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ?",15,0.5,0.5284654498100281
0,0,and you keep losing them .,15,0.5,0.4416835308074951

1,0,that 's just really good id yep .,15,0.5,0.5356563329696655
1,0,"there i mean is that something we 'd want to include , do you think ?",15,0.5,0.6331515312194824

1,0,okay maybe .,15,0.5,0.5551170110702515
1,0,i remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . actually had a cable between it and the t_v_,15,0.5,0.5880709886550903
0,0,"and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something .",15,0.5,0.3751375377178192
1,0,my goodness .,15,0.5,0.6475741267204285
1,0,"and um , you know , when i think about what they are now , it 's better , but actually it 's still kind of , i dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table .",15,0.5,0.5094621777534485
1,0,still feels quite primitive .,15,0.5,0.5202091932296753
1,0,"maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . s",15,0.5,0.5912705659866333
0,0,maybe like a touch screen or something ?,15,0.5,0.4945465922355652
1,0,"something like that , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5440717935562134
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5516259074211121
1,0,or whatever would be technologically reasonable .,15,0.5,0.5295023918151855
0,0,"uh-huh , okay . well i guess that 's up to our industrial designer .",15,0.5,0.4130818247795105
1,0,"'cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that does n't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having",15,0.5,0.621356725692749

1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.6252790093421936
1,0,"right , well um so just to wrap up the next meeting 's gon na be in thirty minutes . so that 's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you 're gon na be working on you know the actual working design of it",15,0.5,0.5647785663604736
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.48003560304641724
1,0,"so y you know what you 're doing there . um for user interface , technical functions , i guess that 's you know like what we 've been talking about , what it 'll actually do . um and uh marketing executive , you 'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you 'll all get instructions emailed to you , i guess .",15,0.5,0.5651145577430725
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5912054181098938
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.4468317925930023
1,0,"yeah , so it 's th the functional design stage is next , i guess . and uh and that 's the end of the meeting . so i got that little message a lot sooner than i thought i would , so",15,0.5,0.6255738735198975
1,0,"um . before we wrap up , just to make sure we 're all on the same page here ,",15,0.5,0.5224888920783997
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6022312641143799
0,0,"um , do we we were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something ,",15,0.5,0.4031085669994354
1,0,"uh-huh , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6427866816520691
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5315915942192078
1,0,"right ? well , um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ?",15,0.5,0.5493314266204834
1,0,"th okay , well just very quickly",15,0.5,0.5722688436508179
0,0,i i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.43949824571609497
1,0,"'cause this we 're supposed to finish now . um i guess that 's up to us ,",15,0.5,0.531279444694519
1,0,"yep . yeah , sure .",15,0.5,0.543078601360321
1,0,"i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , so um , you know",15,0.5,0.5507457852363586
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6586090922355652
0,0,i think one factor would be production cost .,15,0.5,0.4527111053466797
0,0,"okay , yeah .",15,0.5,0.47718778252601624

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7255486845970154
0,0,so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . um .,15,0.5,0.4411522150039673
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4718729555606842

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6697528958320618
0,0,i think that that 's the main factor .,15,0.5,0.4323973059654236
0,0,yeah . okay .,15,0.5,0.4163967967033386

0,0,cool .,15,0.5,0.4978025555610657
1,1,"yep . soon as i get this . okay . this is our last meeting . um i 'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . uh and then we 'll have a , the prototype presentation . um then we will um do an evaluation . uh or we 'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we 'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . um then we 'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we 'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . um let 's see , minutes from the last meeting . um we looked at uh the the trends . we had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . it was twice as important as anything else . um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . um and a spongy feel . so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . um looking at other other devices . um the ipod , we really liked the look of that . um we also had uh the kid 's remote for a simple idea . um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . but i think we 've still decided not to go with that . then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . so i 'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over .",15,0.5,0.524578869342804
1,0,the prototype discussion .,15,0.5,0.50416100025177
1,0,the prototype yeah . do you need a this ?,15,0.5,0.5372803807258606
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.4968419671058655
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5360395908355713
1,0,can try to plug that in there,15,0.5,0.5628025531768799
1,0,there is our remo the banana .,15,0.5,0.5709692239761353
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.4727459251880646
0,0,"um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it 's basically designed around a banana .",15,0.5,0.48196277022361755
1,0,"um but it would be held in such a fashion ,",15,0.5,0.6976023316383362
0,0,"where it is , obviously it would n't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . these would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . so that 's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . you have to use your imagination a little bit . and this here represents the screen , where you , where you 'd go through .",15,0.5,0.4788525402545929
1,0,very nice .,15,0.5,0.5205879807472229
1,0,"and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . volume up and down . and then to access the more complicated functions you 'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . it 's that that simple . that just represents the infrared uh beam . that 's a simple on and off switch . um i do n't know , we could use the voice . t that blue bits should be yellow , that that 'd be where the batteries would be i suppose . and um that 's about it . it 's as simple as you , we could make it really .",15,0.5,0.547856867313385
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5436437129974365
1,0,is there anything you want to add ?,15,0.5,0.5313436985015869
0,0,"that 's what we have there . that 's plastic . plastic covered with rubber . we might uh add some more underneath here . maybe give it , give it a form . i mean you 're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere ,",15,0.5,0.4742050766944885
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5133675336837769

1,0,"so yeah ,",15,0.5,0.5022940635681152
0,0,does n't make much make much difference .,15,0.5,0.48224830627441406
1,0,you have some rub yeah .,15,0.5,0.5263053178787231
1,0,you could work left-handed or right-handed i suppose .,15,0.5,0.5546119213104248
0,0,"exactly , use both . might as well think about",15,0.5,0.4229390323162079
1,0,t the actual thing might be smaller .,15,0.5,0.5891364812850952
0,0,th think about the button as well . like either put either one one on either side or,15,0.5,0.3786272406578064
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5796336531639099
0,0,what but what 's that button ?,15,0.5,0.44939807057380676
0,0,not do it at all . it 's a quick on-off button .,15,0.5,0.440182089805603
1,0,just the on and off .,15,0.5,0.5498733520507812

1,0,that 's um,15,0.5,0.5005728602409363
1,0,yeah i think it 's pretty important . so you do n't have to fiddle with that .,15,0.5,0.6048575043678284
1,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.6163986325263977
1,0,right ? um that 's not um,15,0.5,0.562591016292572
0,0,i 'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . you wan na play with that over there .,15,0.5,0.4561205506324768
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6830766797065735
1,0,there you go .,15,0.5,0.5582050085067749
1,0,"it 's you know it 's flimsy 'cause it 's made out of heavy play-doh ,",15,0.5,0.5270658135414124
1,0,would you like to uh,15,0.5,0.5220108032226562
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.53656005859375
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5397865176200867

1,0,well done .,15,0.5,0.693385899066925
1,0,kind of a banana .,15,0.5,0.5034518241882324
0,0,and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose . with the scroll and the l_c_d_ .,15,0.5,0.4754689931869507
0,0,well luckily we are going to find out . or not luckily . um do you have a marketing presentation for us .,15,0.5,0.38038399815559387
1,1,how do you wear this thing ?,15,0.5,0.6473242044448853
0,0,hmm . mm mm mm .,15,0.5,0.2946341335773468
1,0,not too many cables and stuff .,15,0.5,0.6569402813911438
0,0,original .,15,0.5,0.3716846704483032
1,0,"is recorded ? okay ? okay so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . so i will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff ,",15,0.5,0.6862670183181763
0,0,then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . so,15,0.5,0.45481693744659424
1,0,"uh . just one thing . uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but i have something else to do uh , so got ta have another meeting uh soon ,",15,0.5,0.5338951349258423
0,0,so maybe you could hurry up a bit,15,0.5,0.3934512138366699
1,0,sorry ?,15,0.5,0.742608904838562
1,0,it 's true . i have another meeting so if you could uh,15,0.5,0.5596521496772766
1,0,you have another meeting soon ?,15,0.5,0.5107002854347229
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6037693619728088
1,0,so you have to be quick .,15,0.5,0.5220356583595276
0,0,"yeah , for the lawnmower project .",15,0.5,0.47757190465927124
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.45298901200294495
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.516021728515625
1,0,"so the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly .",15,0.5,0.5395745038986206
1,0,"so uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . first it will be the functional design . third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . so the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . and then we will move to f conceptual design where we 'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that .",15,0.5,0.6173620820045471
0,1,"okay um , welcome to our detailed design meeting . i 'm pretty excited . let 's start it 's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . okay um the agenda we 're gon na do an opening and then um i 'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we 'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . we 'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the um last the last one , oh i do n't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we 're gon na use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we 're not gon na need a a shuffle um , we 're gon na need a scroll um , we 're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that 's curved and um we 're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . okay ? let 's do the look and feel design presentation first .",15,0.5,0.4580245614051819
1,0,"right , do you wan na start ?",15,0.5,0.5894952416419983
0,0,"right , well we made three different prototypes and i guess we 'll start with with this one . um we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . um it 's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it 's easily adaptable to either hand . you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even i mean there 's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . we have our up and down buttons , which are also gon na be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . if you push if you 're just pushing these normally , they 're the menu buttons , if uh the volume buttons rather . if you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . if we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your t_v_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here . um if people wan na grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . that 's our number one prototype . um do you wan na present the potato ,",15,0.5,0.4264850616455078
1,0,like a little lightning in it .,15,0.5,0.5552800893783569
0,0,or shall i present the martian ?,15,0.5,0.4542730450630188
1,0,"okay ,",15,0.5,0.5358800292015076
1,0,"the little lightning bolt in it , very cute .",15,0.5,0.5345225930213928
1,0,"um what we call that one the rhombus ,",15,0.5,0.5258614420890808
1,0,i could,15,0.5,0.5585222244262695
1,0,the v the rhombus rhombus ?,15,0.5,0.5307639241218567
1,0,uh the rhombus .,15,0.5,0.6287751197814941
0,0,"that 's the rhombus , yep .",15,0.5,0.4619966447353363
1,0,"um this one is known as the potato , uh it 's",15,0.5,0.6357448697090149
1,0,it 's a,15,0.5,0.5755584239959717
1,0,"how can i present it ? it 's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . um it 's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . um i 've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . so you 've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that 's um moves between your favourite channels that you 've selected . uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you 're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and that 's basically it , that 's the potato .",15,0.5,0.5078995227813721
1,0,"um on , off ?",15,0.5,0.5977497696876526
0,0,"uh that would be one of your channels , basically ,",15,0.5,0.4873045086860657
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6326201558113098
0,0,"so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off ,",15,0.5,0.4016021490097046
1,0,yeah we turn it off .,15,0.5,0.6428993940353394
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6545626521110535
0,0,could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ?,15,0.5,0.3976982533931732
1,0,"um not really ,",15,0.5,0.5452906489372253
0,0,"it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your t_v_ off .",15,0.5,0.4121546745300293
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5519747138023376
1,0,if you pressed and held it maybe .,15,0.5,0.5133592486381531
1,0,"yeah yeah , that that 'd be one way of doing it , yeah . that 'd work , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5873932242393494
1,0,"if you like held it down , that would be on off .",15,0.5,0.5571621060371399
1,0,"yeah . on off , that 's a possibility , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5020973086357117
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6132527589797974
0,0,"and then finally we have um the martian or the pear , either way . um it 's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . we have the five preset seeds .",15,0.5,0.456114798784256
1,0,"and then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . so , that 's for your consideration as well , plus it 's an interesting talking point to have standing up .",15,0.5,0.6212180256843567
1,0,let 's pass .,15,0.5,0.5657464861869812
1,0,"we figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if i made the bot the bottom flat .",15,0.5,0.5131315588951111
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.5733014941215515
1,0,"sorry , what 's the yellow one in the middle ,",15,0.5,0.5170091986656189
0,0,uh the menu select button .,15,0.5,0.3632194399833679
1,0,i forgot .,15,0.5,0.566249430179596
0,0,very interesting . i think that one 's my favourite .,15,0.5,0.4311272203922272
0,0,"so that 's so that 's our three prototypes . um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we 'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wan na put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever .",15,0.5,0.4742535948753357
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5962625741958618
0,0,"we were we were thinking that normally we 'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we 're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we 'd have one version that 's a bit toned down ,",15,0.5,0.4726160764694214
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.4585912525653839
0,0,"maybe with with less contrasts on it . yeah , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but",15,0.5,0.4300192892551422
1,0,"would yeah , but we do n't want it to look like a kids ' toy .",15,0.5,0.5114034414291382
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4971086084842682
1,0,"now that was one thing that we brought up over email . i do n't know if you picked up your email , but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost .",15,0.5,0.5998214483261108
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.550339937210083
1,0,"right . well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it 's not just like another piece of technology around your house . it 's gon na be somewhere that it can be seen .",15,0.5,0.5213486552238464
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5786352157592773
0,0,so we 're we 're not thinking that it 's gon na be as critical to have the loss,15,0.5,0.3991907238960266
1,0,but if it 's like under covers or like in a couch you still ca n't see it .,15,0.5,0.7388833165168762
0,0,"it 's really would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like i dunno , you tape to your to your t_v_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? do you think that would be conceptually possible ?",15,0.5,0.3186624348163605
1,0,i think,15,0.5,0.6323462724685669
1,0,"i think it would be difficult technologically ,",15,0.5,0.5272152423858643
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4742887318134308
1,0,"because if your if your remote 's lost it 's probably under the settee and in that case you ca n't you ca n't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it ,",15,0.5,0.5693984031677246
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.32134515047073364
1,0,s so it 's i 'm not quite sure how it would work,15,0.5,0.6199034452438354
0,0,"that 's true , mm 'kay .",15,0.5,0.37007883191108704
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5395181775093079
1,0,"and then i wonder if it 's if it 's more just a gimmick then anything else . uh i mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ?",15,0.5,0.5684803128242493
0,0,"there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon .",15,0.5,0.46197202801704407
1,0,"mm-hmm . okay , that 's a fair evaluation . getting lost . um we so we do we 've decided not to worry about that for now . okay 'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you 're right , they 're gon na stick out , but um",15,0.5,0.5793646574020386
1,0,so d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? um .,15,0.5,0.6003196239471436
0,0,"i feel like this is simil or it 's sort of what already exists so if we 're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you 're init i 'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it 's like comfortable and like not different . i sort of like this one , like i i do n't know why , it just it 's like small but still sort of like cute looking , i dunno . but i also like the b the side buttons on that one , like i think that 's kind of neat .",15,0.5,0.4774530827999115
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5499361157417297
1,0,"but i dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on .",15,0.5,0.6392228603363037
0,0,could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? so then w we would n't have to have like a dual function ?,15,0.5,0.41081124544143677
0,0,"mm yeah ,",15,0.5,0.47544699907302856
1,0,"yeah , it 's possible , yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6372848153114319
0,0,"ah ,",15,0.5,0.4479007124900818
1,0,"that 's good , that 's good .",15,0.5,0.5553483366966248
1,0,there we go .,15,0.5,0.5268020033836365
1,0,"here , stick it on .",15,0.5,0.5325866341590881
0,0,put an extra the button on .,15,0.5,0.38916176557540894
1,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.6413256525993347
0,0,"um uh why do n't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you 've developed some ?",15,0.5,0.38991260528564453
1,0,well do we w like i think we 're supposed to have one that we do it for .,15,0.5,0.5890325307846069
1,0,oh okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5360408425331116

0,0,so where,15,0.5,0.49466580152511597
1,0,"i was a little vague on what exactly i 'm supposed to do , but let me i have to like write something on the whiteboard , so .",15,0.5,0.5421838164329529
0,0,okay . do you need this,15,0.5,0.45080673694610596
0,0,or just write on the white board ?,15,0.5,0.4608810245990753

1,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.5574806332588196
1,0,maybe a little smaller than that .,15,0.5,0.5270243287086487
1,0,"no , i kinda like it .",15,0.5,0.5249377489089966
0,0,that 's hard to miss .,15,0.5,0.4539893567562103
1,0,it makes look more fruity as well .,15,0.5,0.5356304049491882
1,0,"oh it does ,",15,0.5,0.5935002565383911
1,0,it 's kind of like,15,0.5,0.5164080262184143
1,0,"it 's like a deformed foot , i dunno .",15,0.5,0.6135077476501465
1,0,"there it could have a stem like that , 'cause i do l kind of like the stem .",15,0.5,0.5117501616477966
1,0,like,15,0.5,0.5242127180099487
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.591643750667572
1,0,"yeah . it almost helps you ge keep a grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers .",15,0.5,0.5021014213562012
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.611350953578949

1,0,interesting .,15,0.5,0.5308771133422852
0,0,i like this one .,15,0.5,0.43715715408325195
1,0,"okay ,",15,0.5,0.5150127410888672
0,0,variety of colours are nice .,15,0.5,0.3927905559539795
1,0,"is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? i like the idea of the",15,0.5,0.6929916143417358
0,0,i think i 'm leaning towards the potato .,15,0.5,0.3587423264980316
1,0,"i mean that 's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one .",15,0.5,0.5417272448539734
0,0,"mm-hmm . i am worried about like um using a menu . um in that like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ?",15,0.5,0.37098535895347595
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.43464353680610657
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6993178725242615
0,0,"well that on the ipod , for example , you just every time you wan na go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level .",15,0.5,0.41821807622909546
0,0,"but that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one 's both the menu and the select button ?",15,0.5,0.3922312259674072
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5762813687324524
1,0,good point .,15,0.5,0.6271358728408813
0,0,"this is , it 's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices .",15,0.5,0.28979456424713135
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5789646506309509
0,0,you find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh .,15,0.5,0.43081042170524597
1,0,could these be used for going to submenus,15,0.5,0.5195781588554382
1,0,"yeah . yeah , so they 're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah .",15,0.5,0.598919153213501
1,0,or,15,0.5,0.5364858508110046
1,0,"maybe yeah ,",15,0.5,0.509456217288971
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.556499719619751
0,0,"maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something .",15,0.5,0.48401403427124023
0,0,"mm-hmm . okay . well , as long as we have that in mind as we 're designing it still , mm 'kay .",15,0.5,0.44196662306785583
1,0,"okay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities , the yellowy one is that",15,0.5,0.6386774778366089
1,0,the potato ? are we leaning towards the potato ?,15,0.5,0.5809355974197388
1,0,potato .,15,0.5,0.5245075821876526
1,0,i think so .,15,0.5,0.5260582566261292
0,0,"okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one .",15,0.5,0.45514965057373047
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4054846167564392
1,0,so basically what we need to do is some of the things that we 've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to .,15,0.5,0.5925065279006958
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.3255111277103424
0,0,so what we sort of wan na do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then i 'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that .,15,0.5,0.48313137888908386
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5732250809669495
1,0,"so we 'll just go through them one at a time and we 'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we 've created conforms to the following criteria . so we can do this one first . first we wan na know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . so like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i 'm gon na say it 's like a three . that 's just my opinion .",15,0.5,0.515495777130127
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4856128990650177
1,0,what does each of you,15,0.5,0.5803555250167847
0,0,i i kind of think it 's it 's unique enough that i 'd give it a one or a two .,15,0.5,0.4822871685028076
0,0,"okay , well give it a number ,",15,0.5,0.47032302618026733

0,0,i will give it a one .,15,0.5,0.43019649386405945

1,0,"and two , awesome . alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? i think it 's extremely functional , i 'm gon na give it a one .",15,0.5,0.5754784941673279
1,0,"yeah , one .",15,0.5,0.5285831689834595
1,0,one ?,15,0.5,0.527978241443634

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.557182788848877
1,0,"um functional . i think it 'll get everything done , i think it might be a little confusing at first , um , i do n't know if that 's gon na be a later one .",15,0.5,0.5541419386863708
0,0,"okay . well there 's some other ones , i will address that ,",15,0.5,0.42829665541648865
1,0,"okay , then i 'm gon na give it a two .",15,0.5,0.536014974117279
1,0,"yeah . awesome , okay . um we wan na know next if it 's technologically innovative .",15,0.5,0.5132846236228943
1,0,did you give a functional ?,15,0.5,0.5247485041618347

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6120275855064392
0,0,"um is it technologically innovative ? mm . not really , i mean not so much , 'cause we we do n't have the l_c_d_ screen , we do n't have fancy chip . other than what it looks like , i dunno if it 's really",15,0.5,0.3531562387943268
1,0,"well , the kinetic battery .",15,0.5,0.6201130747795105

0,0,but we know it 's there .,15,0.5,0.44664260745048523
1,0,"they 'll be like hey , i have never changed the battery .",15,0.5,0.6305193305015564

0,0,mm . just the material .,15,0.5,0.3396454453468323
1,0,i 'll give it a three . 'cause it we could 've picked a lot of features that would 've made it really,15,0.5,0.6520550847053528
0,0,"yeah . i i would say that it 's yeah , like fancy versus creative it 's it 's different . but does that equal innovative ? i dunno . i 'll give it a three .",15,0.5,0.30883121490478516
1,0,alright . everyone else ?,15,0.5,0.7258890867233276

0,0,think i 'm gon na go with the four as well .,15,0.5,0.4307608902454376
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.2739591598510742
1,0,i really like that kinetic battery though .,15,0.5,0.6511600017547607
0,0,"next , is it easy to use ? just so you know , easy to learn will be separate ,",15,0.5,0.402626633644104
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.41178861260414124

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5360447764396667
1,0,i think it 's really easy to use . i 'll give it a two .,15,0.5,0.5339327454566956
1,0,um i 'll give it a one . pretty hard to mess up .,15,0.5,0.5250269174575806
0,0,i 'll say one .,15,0.5,0.4833678901195526
1,0,uh let 's say two .,15,0.5,0.6629197597503662
0,0,alright . um we next wan na see if it has a spongy quality,15,0.5,0.4863220751285553
1,0,and if indeed it 's made of latex or rubber i it 's spongy all the way .,15,0.5,0.5759332776069641
1,0,give it a one .,15,0.5,0.5097971558570862

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6109433174133301
1,0,i wonder if it bounces when you drop it .,15,0.5,0.5148435235023499
1,0,"ooh , that you could n't",15,0.5,0.5869729518890381

0,0,uh um .,15,0.5,0.4605250954627991
1,0,"well , is it gon na be yellow ?",15,0.5,0.5952143669128418

1,0,um well,15,0.5,0.5579031109809875
1,0,we might wan na keep it yellow .,15,0.5,0.5731956362724304
0,0,"if we i know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that 'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that 's more fruity .",15,0.5,0.41336068511009216

1,0,one .,15,0.5,0.5165238380432129
1,0,"alright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? remember earlier we discussed that people do n't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . i think we really took that into account a lot , so i 'm gon na give it a one .",15,0.5,0.5667368769645691
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4562598764896393

1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.556165337562561
1,0,"okay um , also we talked earlier about r_s_i_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like carpal tunnely kind of thing . do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? i think i 'll give it a two , 'cause i almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gon na happen .",15,0.5,0.5876092314720154
1,0,it 's gon na be hard .,15,0.5,0.5335178971290588

1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6021745204925537
1,0,"and if it 's repetitive movement it is gon na be only four buttons that you 're constantly pushing , but um",15,0.5,0.5325502157211304
0,0,"um um worth the risk , i think .",15,0.5,0.41977813839912415
0,0,i like how it fits in the hand though so i i 'd go with a two .,15,0.5,0.40673553943634033

1,0,yeah i 'll i 'll say two .,15,0.5,0.5950911641120911
0,0,"alright , awesome . and the ease of learning it . i know you were saying that you 're a little bit nervous about that , i dunno . it sort of reminds me of the ipod . i just got mine , i still have n't read the instruction book and i 'm doing okay , so",15,0.5,0.4643342196941376
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.6650119423866272
0,0,and i 'm not good at learning technology . so i 'll give it a two .,15,0.5,0.47835415601730347
0,0,"the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but i think if it 's one it 's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you 'll have it afterwards .",15,0.5,0.42754948139190674
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4260717034339905
0,0,so i 'd i think i 'd give it a two i guess .,15,0.5,0.47885966300964355
1,0,"i think it it 's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are",15,0.5,0.5706820487976074
1,0,"oh , good point .",15,0.5,0.5842333436012268

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.535014271736145
1,0,"once you 've , yeah once you 'd learned how to use it , i think it is a lot easier . so i 'd i 'd give it a four .",15,0.5,0.5556581020355225
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4134649336338043
0,0,"i think i 'd give it a four too . it 's a pretty high learning curve , it 'll be easy once you 've done it , but",15,0.5,0.39343535900115967
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6030483245849609
1,0,"mm-hmm . alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we 're not addressing that at all , so",15,0.5,0.6016494631767273
1,0,we we,15,0.5,0.5143693685531616
0,0,"i think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , but",15,0.5,0.4314596354961395
1,0,"okay , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? i 'm gon na i 'm gon na give it a four , 'cause i think that you can still if it 's in between somewhere where you ca n't see it , you 're kind of not gon na find it ,",15,0.5,0.6605257391929626
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4388025104999542
0,0,but anywhere else it 's gon na stand out .,15,0.5,0.499724417924881
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.580223798751831
1,0,"um i 'd say i 'd give it uh a three , i guess it depends on how tidy you are normally .",15,0.5,0.5618856549263
0,0,mm i 'd give it a four .,15,0.5,0.37766557931900024
1,0,"um i 'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6099530458450317
0,0,small too .,15,0.5,0.4445342421531677
1,0,"alright , we also said simplicity , how w how well does it address just being simple ?",15,0.5,0.6520429253578186
0,0,simple to use or simple in design ? do you know ?,15,0.5,0.3510759472846985
1,0,"i think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion ,",15,0.5,0.5828959941864014
0,0,"so those are the next two things we 're gon na look at . separate from fancy , like that sort of thing .",15,0.5,0.4685679078102112
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5994277000427246
0,0,"um it like wants to be simple but it 's not like totally totally simple , so i 'm gon na give it a two .",15,0.5,0.42558738589286804
0,0,i 'm give it a three i guess .,15,0.5,0.4535306990146637
1,0,i 'll give it a two .,15,0.5,0.53271484375
1,0,three .,15,0.5,0.5571775436401367
1,1,"this does n't work . so yeah function design . um you guys know me , pedro , and um what i found is we want to do fashion and i think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . if basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . um something cute and small . the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . so we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at .",15,0.5,0.5096808075904846
0,0,"and um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people wo n't wo n't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations . there 's no need to have that in the remote . so um um as for what i would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh i will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . um and uh although i th i th i 'm still here recommending the teletext so i 'll remove that , i guess , but um we should go for the",15,0.5,0.4341607093811035
1,0,"but i t i think what the the management recommendation was less that there 's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we should n't have it . so i i still think if it 's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there .",15,0.5,0.5034667253494263
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.45406749844551086
0,0,"because otherwise we 're just going to i mean even if it 's necessary or not , if you if you 're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it is n't more expensive for us to k make because as far as i understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? so it should be in there .",15,0.5,0.40427830815315247
1,0,right as far as,15,0.5,0.5133041143417358
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5588045120239258
0,0,i it 's just uh the cost of an extra button . i mean software-wise there 's really no difference .,15,0.5,0.45031383633613586
1,0,yeah . okay . is n't,15,0.5,0.5441200137138367
0,0,i think .,15,0.5,0.4911313056945801
1,0,i have maybe a silly question . i in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there 's gon na be the it 's gon na be out-moded teletext . i i do n't understand how those two things are connected . how does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? i do n't understand that .,15,0.5,0.6140555739402771
0,0,well maybe what we 're getting into here is the the idea of uh internet through the t_v_ for example . so that might play on what we can do .,15,0.5,0.4445740878582001
1,0,yeah the they 're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that,15,0.5,0.5928843021392822
1,0,scheduling . um to find out what what you 're watching even if there 's commercials you know .,15,0.5,0.5105584263801575
0,0,and now yeah,15,0.5,0.4534873068332672
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4956408739089966
1,0,and now you can c look it over internet . but i still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities .,15,0.5,0.5954150557518005
1,0,i think i ha i agree .,15,0.5,0.5270636677742004
1,0,"yeah 'cause , yeah , i just i do n't see the cross-over between computers and television . i mean i do see the cross-over in some sense ,",15,0.5,0.5262317061424255
1,0,"yeah , but it 's not happen yet . yeah .",15,0.5,0.521712601184845
1,0,"but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay .",15,0.5,0.6589452028274536
0,0,well for me,15,0.5,0.4096818268299103
1,0,well you have digital t_v_ still already .,15,0.5,0.5008678436279297
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.59003084897995
1,0,so so if we make the cross-over and we 're gon na view television on computers then we 're then we 're losing the the necessity of the remote . s,15,0.5,0.5858098864555359
0,0,unless you have a,15,0.5,0.49511730670928955
0,0,"well there there is a for example on digital t_v_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts ,",15,0.5,0.48893529176712036
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5109055042266846
0,0,and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example .,15,0.5,0.4437020719051361
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4970097541809082
1,0,"a a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can yeah , and there 's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live t_v_ and things like that . they 're just features from the internet uh from computers are are coming into the t_v_ sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext .",15,0.5,0.502161979675293
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6577025651931763
0,0,"so now the things to think here are that that there 's gon na be more functionality , potentially that we can handle .",15,0.5,0.4054839313030243
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.3677824139595032
1,0,yeah but we we do n't we 're not aiming a command for that . that 's the thing . and all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and,15,0.5,0.5042881369590759
1,0,"i think a lot of that 's proprietary anyways . you 're not gon na be able to , you , like command a tivo with our remote . i do n't think .",15,0.5,0.5823627710342407
0,0,"mm . but still there there 's an opportunity . if if it 's , for example , a trainable one then we 're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it .",15,0.5,0.3896546959877014
1,0,"yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so",15,0.5,0.5390418767929077
0,0,mm . okay .,15,0.5,0.4319697916507721
1,0,"well i dunno . one way the other teletext was there but i guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs .",15,0.5,0.6327150464057922
0,0,i think if it 's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . just you know,15,0.5,0.45375439524650574
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4654720723628998
1,0,yeah i do n't i do n't see the logic .,15,0.5,0.583149790763855
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.651279866695404
0,0,"i i do n't see the logic in elimination of teletext , i just i i",15,0.5,0.4192769527435303
1,0,"yeah , and neither do i in fact .",15,0.5,0.6850588917732239
1,0,but i 'm not a tech-mind either . i just do n't see the cross-over between computers and and and,15,0.5,0.5302456617355347
1,0,bu uh .,15,0.5,0.5357723832130432
1,0,"'cause we are designing something for a television , okay .",15,0.5,0.6061623692512512
1,0,"i 'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wan na be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there 's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it does n't affect the price .",15,0.5,0.5486129522323608
0,0,right it 's just not,15,0.5,0.33690381050109863
1,1,"'s to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is ,",15,0.5,0.5986787676811218
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5141251087188721
0,0,so in that sense,15,0.5,0.4737052917480469
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5274326205253601
1,0,"yeah , sure .",15,0.5,0.6059053540229797
1,0,"so it does kind of make sense , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5584330558776855
1,0,"okay , well",15,0.5,0.644618570804596
1,0,"it kinda does make sense , does n't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we 're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background .",15,0.5,0.5580265522003174
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.3905966281890869
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6023507714271545
1,0,everything i have is kinda background .,15,0.5,0.5991841554641724
1,0,okay we all ready to go ?,15,0.5,0.5438727140426636
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.48959025740623474
1,0,well how um on the in this meeting then if we um i 'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we uh decided on,15,0.5,0.6891261339187622
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.46767449378967285
1,0,"decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five ,",15,0.5,0.6360937356948853
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6116818785667419
0,0,"and we decided that it was gon na be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we 're gon na group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um . and i told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . um so that was the last meeting .",15,0.5,0.4740847945213318
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5246622562408447
1,0,is there anything have i forgotten anything ?,15,0.5,0.5060766935348511
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.4180012047290802
1,0,is that everything ?,15,0.5,0.585587203502655
1,0,uh that sounds .,15,0.5,0.5640530586242676
0,0,"okay . um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you 're gon na want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we 'll have all the discussion at the end . that might be a better idea this time .",15,0.5,0.48001137375831604
1,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.5366992950439453
0,0,"and so if we start off uh with andrew and then craig and then david ,",15,0.5,0.4715726673603058
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5101856589317322
1,0,if that 's alright .,15,0.5,0.509443998336792
1,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.6082708239555359
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4451565742492676
1,0,"um and then after that we 'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right .",15,0.5,0.6035853028297424
1,0,"yeah , cool .",15,0.5,0.607988715171814
1,0,so if you wan na take this .,15,0.5,0.5865457057952881
0,0,why do n't i get that ? hmm .,15,0.5,0.39516714215278625
1,0,screwed in quite tightly . uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? we did we say we were gon na try maybe incorporate it but we had n't made a definite decision on that ?,15,0.5,0.6868056058883667
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5236928462982178
0,0,right . oh i should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .,15,0.5,0.43352001905441284
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6257014870643616
0,0,so um that 's kind of the end result hopefully .,15,0.5,0.47403302788734436
1,0,okay . um alright so c is it function f_ eight ?,15,0.5,0.6299382448196411
0,0,uh-huh . hopefully appear in a wee second .,15,0.5,0.44130900502204895
0,0,hmm . come on . i think it 's working .,15,0.5,0.45048561692237854
1,0,up there we go .,15,0.5,0.6094739437103271
1,0,okay great s so let me just start this . okay great . so um uh s move on . uh-huh oh where 'd it all go ?,15,0.5,0.5523623824119568
0,0,oh no .,15,0.5,0.49225834012031555
1,0,it 's not good . okay lem me just see where i can find it . this looks more like it . i think i just opened up the template .,15,0.5,0.524052619934082
1,0,oh right .,15,0.5,0.5700501203536987
1,0,sorry about that . okay alright so let 's have a look here .,15,0.5,0.5700321197509766
0,0,here we go .,15,0.5,0.4207589626312256
1,0,"okay so this was the method that um i 've taken . uh basically what i wan na do here , before we get into it uh too far , is i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .",15,0.5,0.5299572348594666
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.43538355827331543
1,0,"and uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that i 've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . um so i 've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ?",15,0.5,0.6053576469421387
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.3781694769859314
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6125854253768921
1,0,"i thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that 's why i suggested we get in this .",15,0.5,0.5368854403495789
1,0,aye a fair point definitely .,15,0.5,0.6808398365974426
1,0,"okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .",15,0.5,0.5679123997688293
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.46563851833343506
0,0,"um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , i think , creative about it . number two was that it be innovative . okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology . so it i 'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that i think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .",15,0.5,0.49965381622314453
1,0,aye right .,15,0.5,0.5531540513038635
1,0,"for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what i mean , like , or it 's got something else to it that just seems innovative",15,0.5,0.5065619945526123
0,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.45782357454299927
0,0,because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use . so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? well that 's i guess where we 're gon na go with this .,15,0.5,0.46148496866226196
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4400295913219452
1,0,"okay then there 's the other aspect of the back the the market um research i have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we 've agreed is a priority . uh top european fashion trend um that i read about says there 's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay ,",15,0.5,0.5385296940803528
0,0,"especially in clothes and furniture . and when i first saw that i thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it ,",15,0.5,0.3331429660320282
0,0,okay okay .,15,0.5,0.47483372688293457
1,0,"do you know what i mean ? so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . um 'cause i think what we 're in what we 're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um so i think we might wan na be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something ,",15,0.5,0.5705037117004395
1,0,i think that would be pushing it .,15,0.5,0.5634976029396057
1,0,"and then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . so um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year 's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , i think that 'll be in our favour . um so these this is the summary of everything . um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we 're selling to . uh innovative design technology 's also a must in that it 's seen it 'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . that was like the number three thing . and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that 's the way i interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so i 've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , mac ipods ,",15,0.5,0.5264910459518433
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5187293887138367
0,0,"something which is , i 'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there 's like no buttons .",15,0.5,0.3943153917789459
1,0,"mm that 's true , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5014704465866089
1,0,"you know what a mac ipod is ? i 'm thinking however mac ipod is sort of last year 's because it 's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so i 'm thinking if we imagine that we 're taking some of the features of a mac ipod and we 're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . um and then so this is w with all that information what i 'm what i 'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . sort of like a i dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . um does that make sense ? yeah . so so like i threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , i dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it 's just an idea , 'cause i 'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .",15,0.5,0.5997945070266724
0,0,mm 'kay . great .,15,0.5,0.39739683270454407
1,0,"like um the ones the ones which i 'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . like i see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and",15,0.5,0.5226247906684875
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4634547531604767
1,0,so anyway it 's just just an idea .,15,0.5,0.5438634753227234
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5229867100715637
1,0,"i 'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up .",15,0.5,0.5822040438652039
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.29674211144447327
1,0,how can we build on that ? maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so .,15,0.5,0.5637218952178955
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.44028133153915405
1,0,"anyway those are that 's all i have ,",15,0.5,0.5346046686172485
1,0,that 's great .,15,0.5,0.5019288659095764
1,0,but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into,15,0.5,0.5628699064254761
0,0,uh-huh . okay great .,15,0.5,0.43066906929016113
1,1,"okay , is everybody ready ?",15,0.5,0.5106740593910217
1,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.5699686408042908
1,0,yeah i 'd to just put on my microphone here and i 'll be right with you .,15,0.5,0.6007953882217407
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4882911741733551
0,0,okay ?,15,0.5,0.46600541472435
1,0,um i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do,15,0.5,0.5490311980247498
0,0,mm ?,15,0.5,0.4506426751613617
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5171630382537842
1,0,"and um i think the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .",15,0.5,0.6078570485115051
0,0,okay you want me to start right now ?,15,0.5,0.46457141637802124
1,0,"yeah , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.5085909366607666
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5416948795318604
1,0,"well , could you um put my slides up 'cause i think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time .",15,0.5,0.5767679810523987
1,0,okay . you 're participant four .,15,0.5,0.541419267654419
1,0,i 'm participant four i believe . yes uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.5066893696784973
1,0,"okay , and now i can uh full screen .",15,0.5,0.5908394455909729
1,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.5686443448066711
0,0,open .,15,0.5,0.48024773597717285
1,0,"uh , okay , okay .",15,0.5,0.5380672812461853
1,0,"there we go . okay well i think we have introduced ourselves ,",15,0.5,0.5748769044876099
1,0,and then full screen .,15,0.5,0.5491809248924255
1,0,so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why do n't we pass right to the second slide . cause that 's where m my discussion starts . right well um since i 'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it .,15,0.5,0.523076057434082
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5254085659980774
1,0,"um i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason i just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions . you know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your c_d_ whatever you want it to do",15,0.5,0.5366913080215454
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.48981624841690063
1,0,"um and then as we go on what we 'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility . so i 'll be coming to you um frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it 's gon na be to add a feature or how expensive it 's gon na be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it 's just something we ca n't do .",15,0.5,0.5681413412094116
0,0,mm-hmm . yeah . yeah . yeah . hmm hmm . mm .,15,0.5,0.4503666162490845
1,0,so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in,15,0.5,0.5663763284683228
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.40600496530532837
1,0,"and then just weed things out that ca n't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we 'll try to then prioritise those .",15,0.5,0.6751917004585266
0,0,mm-hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.3479638397693634
1,0,"so that was um what i meant there , and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gon na be as important as money , because if we 're gon na sell this thing , i think the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . twenty five euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase ,",15,0.5,0.6438132524490356
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.1693335473537445
1,0,"we want somebody to see it and think it 's , gee i just got ta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . so it 's got ta be really attractive and it but it 's got ta go to market by september , 'cause anything that you do n't already have out there in september showing it around , is n't gon na sell for christmas .",15,0.5,0.6357579231262207
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4419613182544708
1,0,um and then i 'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour,15,0.5,0.5154008269309998
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5171595811843872

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5691385269165039

0,0,what features .,15,0.5,0.32465600967407227
1,0,"what what 's what 's gon na really be what they call a sizzle ,",15,0.5,0.5823485851287842
1,0,s sellable . yes .,15,0.5,0.5100703835487366
0,0,'cause we got ta sell this sizzle .,15,0.5,0.4881005883216858
1,0,a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is n't the thing that somebody 's really just gon na take out their wallet and buy for christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever .,15,0.5,0.6686756610870361
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.34881770610809326
1,0,okay can we go to the next slide please ? alright i i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we 're looking at the uh the whole house idea really is n't gon na be possible . so i 'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we we could suggest anything .,15,0.5,0.582425594329834
1,0,"i 'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we 'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what 'll be and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we 're looking at and at the price point we 're looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v_ , the v_c_r_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .",15,0.5,0.5027894377708435
1,0,"uh okay , can can i at this point interject um something ?",15,0.5,0.5310327410697937
1,0,"i have to wind up ? yeah , sure .",15,0.5,0.531011164188385
0,0,"um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered . um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that 's the teletext ,",15,0.5,0.4210869073867798
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5616382360458374
1,0,"because that 's sort of outdated with the internet ,",15,0.5,0.5358877182006836
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5258466005325317
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.511736273765564
1,0,"and according to to higher management the it should only control the t_v_ ,",15,0.5,0.6836711168289185
0,0,"mostly because they feel that it 's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things ,",15,0.5,0.3347192704677582
1,0,"complicated , yeah , of course .",15,0.5,0.5052441954612732
0,0,and they are concerned with the time to market .,15,0.5,0.4706190228462219
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.48646679520606995
1,0,"of course , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5863220691680908
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.40454837679862976
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6058633327484131
0,0,um and the,15,0.5,0.4576033651828766
1,0,"okay , so that 's something",15,0.5,0.6532683968544006
0,0,"and the third thing that they wan na make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it 's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there 's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out .",15,0.5,0.47967711091041565
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5297889709472656
1,0,"so i just wanted to interject this here so we 're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wan na look at . these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things , so it 's only gon na be t_v_ ,",15,0.5,0.5314972996711731
0,0,okay so,15,0.5,0.3789454698562622
1,0,but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea .,15,0.5,0.5166197419166565
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5462977886199951
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.3530670702457428
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4991558790206909
1,0,"alright , thanks for that . um alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it 's lost somewhere in the room . um so those are two things that we definitely do wan na address , uh we wan na s make it as simple as possible , we wan na make it um obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , and i think that those are things after my research that we definitely wan na try to incorporate . 'kay can we go to the next slide please ? okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that 's gon na make it an impulse purchase . uh because once there 's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs do n't come back .",15,0.5,0.5671190023422241
0,0,"if somebody says , oh i 'll come back and get it next week you 're dead . they 're never gon na come back and buy it . you 've got ta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . and , in order to make it really sellable we 've got ta shorten the learning curve , make sure it 's really intuitive and easy to use . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that 's why i 'm saying , simplicity is good . finding it 's important , obviously you ca n't use it if you ca n't find it . so we 've got ta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and i 've already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five euros i 'm not gon na take that . has to be so great that they 're gon na say , uh twenty five euros is n't much . um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign .",15,0.5,0.45340120792388916
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.38464537262916565
1,0,okay that 's uh about it for me right now .,15,0.5,0.510767936706543
1,0,"okay . and uh who would be next , uh , i guess that would be you . mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.5167051553726196

1,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5612520575523376

1,0,mm-hmm . yep .,15,0.5,0.50859534740448
1,0,"no , it 's like a well you you have to press here . the cup cup shape here ?",15,0.5,0.6334155201911926
1,0,"yeah yeah , uh-huh .",15,0.5,0.5863237977027893
1,0,the thir third .,15,0.5,0.5575785040855408
1,0,"there , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.521327793598175
0,0,yeah exactly . uh so today i 'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . um can you go to the next sli slide please ?,15,0.5,0.48235663771629333
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5154771208763123
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.41455990076065063
1,0,the metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . it should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th,15,0.5,0.6567821502685547
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.36488959193229675
1,0,"this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it 's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . it should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal ,",15,0.5,0.5949206948280334
1,0,signal .,15,0.5,0.5483159422874451
1,0,"and the t_v_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control",15,0.5,0.6772818565368652
0,0,receive .,15,0.5,0.48494815826416016
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5528656840324402
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4794468879699707
1,0,and uh so uh i think it 's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices .,15,0.5,0.5956438183784485
0,0,multi-purpose .,15,0.5,0.48385190963745117
0,0,yo and it 's,15,0.5,0.4962921738624573
0,0,"yeah well that 's already been eliminated by management , so we 're off the hook .",15,0.5,0.4774586260318756
0,0,yeah but it 's so .,15,0.5,0.49579668045043945
1,0,uh yeah .,15,0.5,0.6448837518692017
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4459676146507263
1,0,"um . so uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . so uh you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh t_v_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there 's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t_v_ can perform the actions .",15,0.5,0.6220636963844299
0,0,mm okay .,15,0.5,0.40753042697906494
1,0,so can you go to the next slide please ?,15,0.5,0.5084859132766724
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.43808895349502563
1,0,"so i i just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um i think these are the very simple features and uh they do n't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also ,",15,0.5,0.6280022859573364
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.37663084268569946
1,0,it 's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they 'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark .,15,0.5,0.5209556221961975
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.41973111033439636
0,0,"and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it 's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . and there should be a child lock , like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they ca n't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they 'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it 's a it 's hard but i think it 's possible",15,0.5,0.4874083697795868
1,0,"yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that 's that 's unfortunately a moot point now . mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.5397043228149414
1,0,but it uh,15,0.5,0.5093136429786682
0,0,well we already eliminated that .,15,0.5,0.4889790117740631
1,0,yeah yeah yeah,15,0.5,0.5940023064613342
1,0,eliminated .,15,0.5,0.5617334842681885
1,0,"so it 's it 's okay , yeah , yeah . and uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands",15,0.5,0.5117232799530029
1,0,and um so that uh,15,0.5,0.6003901362419128
1,0,"now that 's good from a marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape .",15,0.5,0.6037927865982056
0,0,"yeah , yeah , yeah and colours also , different colours , and",15,0.5,0.4887430667877197
1,0,yeah i,15,0.5,0.7226936221122742
0,0,mm-hmm colours .,15,0.5,0.43091949820518494
1,0,and that you you say that wo n't add too much to the budget ?,15,0.5,0.6697964668273926
1,0,"no no no , it wo n't uh i do n't think it will be like ,",15,0.5,0.5324698090553284
1,0,to d the shape is uh,15,0.5,0.5277014374732971
1,0,you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more,15,0.5,0.5847160220146179
0,0,it just build a mould basically and uh you know .,15,0.5,0.48760169744491577
1,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.6232663989067078
1,0,yes exactly .,15,0.5,0.5676597952842712
1,0,it 's it 's just a s shape so it does n't matter .,15,0.5,0.5428769588470459
1,0,as the budget we 're looking at if you build one mould i do n't think that 's going to make a big difference whether it 's gon na be square or,15,0.5,0.5161751508712769
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6060172319412231
0,0,do you think there 's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?,15,0.5,0.4152589738368988
1,0,yeah that is also possible i uh yeah i i yeah .,15,0.5,0.6382834315299988
1,0,oh yes .,15,0.5,0.564293384552002
1,0,is that gon na be a possible ?,15,0.5,0.6159150004386902
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5286788940429688
1,0,i think,15,0.5,0.5616070032119751
1,0,'cause that might help with the marketing .,15,0.5,0.5396537184715271
1,0,i think we will have to look at the budget on that,15,0.5,0.510793149471283
1,0,yeah that will be,15,0.5,0.5937284231185913
1,0,"but i think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun , you know .",15,0.5,0.5411304831504822
1,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.6315639019012451
1,0,because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of,15,0.5,0.5901895761489868
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5189567804336548
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5546754598617554
1,0,silly for children .,15,0.5,0.5712641477584839
1,0,"yeah , for children , yeah exactly .",15,0.5,0.5956724882125854
1,0,silly for children,15,0.5,0.5426458120346069
1,0,like an animal or,15,0.5,0.5672255158424377
1,0,or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .,15,0.5,0.5235633254051208

0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4822176396846771
1,0,"and and the butto buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . if you have less features then your remote controller wo n't be attractive , so i think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate the matter more i think so .",15,0.5,0.5099628567695618
1,0,"mm . well , i think i think that that 's something that we 'll have to discuss um with the user interface person",15,0.5,0.6023188829421997

1,0,because i think there 's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . because i think one of the things were complaining about in my what i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one .,15,0.5,0.7067831754684448
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3771943151950836
1,0,the changing modes was something,15,0.5,0.5487423539161682
1,0,"yeah , it 's like you know yeah .",15,0.5,0.5504184365272522

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5302050113677979
1,0,"changing modes is nothing for us , but people who",15,0.5,0.6089332103729248
0,0,"yeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know ,",15,0.5,0.35018205642700195
1,0,n and,15,0.5,0.5950549840927124

1,0,mm-hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5988848209381104
1,0,you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else,15,0.5,0.6169301867485046
1,0,"yeah , yes .",15,0.5,0.5403925180435181
1,0,and they 're very frustrated you know .,15,0.5,0.5610232353210449
1,0,something else .,15,0.5,0.5852947235107422
1,0,"and that 's and that 's the kind of thing people learn by feel , and um you do n't feel the mode change .",15,0.5,0.5125576257705688
1,0,"yeah , yeah you do n't us yeah yeah , usually . yeah .",15,0.5,0.6364517211914062
1,0,so um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .,15,0.5,0.5118110775947571
0,0,"yeah shapes also , different shapes .",15,0.5,0.49975764751434326
1,0,"you know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it .",15,0.5,0.6541404724121094
1,0,yeah that will mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5597339868545532
1,0,channels .,15,0.5,0.5205092430114746

0,0,so yeah .,15,0.5,0.4828391671180725
1,0,and uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i i do n't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit i think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it 's,15,0.5,0.6151798367500305
0,0,"yeah , that 's that 's a good that 's a good one ,",15,0.5,0.42625007033348083

1,0,"yeah , and we display a clock .",15,0.5,0.6012375354766846
1,0,"because the clock would be really friendly ,",15,0.5,0.6265420913696289
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4865657687187195

0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.48362934589385986
1,0,"yeah , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so",15,0.5,0.6624877452850342
1,0,yeah you 're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh,15,0.5,0.5719923973083496
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.6003217697143555
1,0,"and yeah , and a lot of time there 's not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wan na look at the news for a minute .",15,0.5,0.5951732397079468
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.557262122631073

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4994543194770813
1,0,"uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch . and uh bulbs . like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the t_v_ is on suppose ,",15,0.5,0.5702971816062927
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3469125032424927
1,0,then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light .,15,0.5,0.7093179225921631
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3779289126396179
1,0,"then it will be like if you switch on your t_v_ through anoth another source , not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light .",15,0.5,0.6420307755470276
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.35443899035453796
1,0,"maybe we can have that . whenever the t_v_ is on , remote controller will have a light .",15,0.5,0.5959746837615967
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.47760552167892456

0,0,"and a chip ,",15,0.5,0.42554357647895813
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5645365118980408
1,0,"chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations ,",15,0.5,0.5884101390838623
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4526316523551941

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5036312937736511
1,0,"so there should be wires . and uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .",15,0.5,0.5621277093887329
0,0,to keep the remote ? yeah .,15,0.5,0.486322283744812
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5826883912086487

1,0,"holder , yeah , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.5268183946609497
1,0,"um uh can you move onto the next slide . um next sli slide please . um i have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website , uh from where i have uh uh i got s few points .",15,0.5,0.5241810083389282
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5072476863861084

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6031032204627991
1,0,so it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what 's up there ? or,15,0.5,0.5875899791717529
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.4850246012210846
1,0,"well , you do n't have to .",15,0.5,0.5841864943504333
1,0,"uh it 's not like that , i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so .",15,0.5,0.6722666025161743
1,0,okay . okay . so it might be helpful if we had a look at that .,15,0.5,0.5104553699493408
1,0,"yeah if you want . yeah , it 's okay .",15,0.5,0.5201393365859985

0,0,"uh , it 's actually there now , there on the screen .",15,0.5,0.4334559440612793
1,0,this one ?,15,0.5,0.541309118270874
1,0,"yeah , okay , thank you .",15,0.5,0.5289948582649231
1,0,and francine ?,15,0.5,0.5874801874160767
1,0,participant two .,15,0.5,0.5040124654769897
1,0,you are number two ?,15,0.5,0.6204027533531189
1,0,"yes . no no , i 'm three .",15,0.5,0.5350780487060547
1,0,you 're three . would you want it full full screen ?,15,0.5,0.5601803064346313
1,0,i can make it full ? yes yes yes .,15,0.5,0.5152518153190613
1,0,mm-hmm ? okay .,15,0.5,0.5174641013145447
1,0,okay . as uh user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote .,15,0.5,0.6152181625366211
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3973366618156433
1,0,yeah can you please go onto the next slide ?,15,0.5,0.5844900012016296
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5069685578346252
1,0,"so i found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . now for that , uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v_ .",15,0.5,0.5870928764343262
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4283509850502014
1,0,there should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it .,15,0.5,0.5351296067237854
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5851103067398071
0,0,now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice .,15,0.5,0.40553733706474304
1,0,"on the on on the remote . yeah , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.5844006538391113
1,0,"yes . yes . so if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the t_v_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .",15,0.5,0.5097885727882385
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm . right . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.48834267258644104
1,0,"so he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children can not view that channel .",15,0.5,0.5693539977073669
1,0,"yes . by your child , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.5296673774719238
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.48595118522644043
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4569685459136963
1,0,and uh the uh the uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote .,15,0.5,0.6315163373947144
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3699806034564972
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5632457733154297
1,0,uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v_ television . and um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t_ in alphabet for more compactability .,15,0.5,0.529498815536499
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4229656755924225
1,0,"and uh and uh and it is one more point which i noted it down , like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person .",15,0.5,0.6110813617706299

0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.46738389134407043
1,0,"and it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight p_m_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock ,",15,0.5,0.640193521976471

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5010348558425903
1,0,and i do n't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .,15,0.5,0.6501643061637878
0,1,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4406011402606964

1,0,cool .,15,0.5,0.5946228504180908
0,0,oh dear . yes .,15,0.5,0.4985814690589905
1,0,"i live um i live right across the street from an open space in california . we have coyotes howl all the time . so i really enjoy their their singing , you they 're really beautiful animals . mm . okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . we 're gon na talk about project finances . um we have a couple we 'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it 's a we have a market range of internet , like it 's an international market range , we do n't have to worry about specifics . um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro . so we 're selling it for twice what we 'd like to produce it for . okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , i could i 'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you do n't like , etcetera , so",15,0.5,0.5865426063537598
1,0,"um i hate when there 's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t_v_ like you have to do one for the power of the t_v_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , i do n't know . now they keep combining all different remotes together , and i do n't know if i necessarily like that 'cause i feel like you end up with multimedia overload .",15,0.5,0.5069354772567749
1,0,i just wan na watch the t_v_ um .,15,0.5,0.547725260257721
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4874304533004761
1,0,always gets lost . some sort of like device to help you find it .,15,0.5,0.5873414874076843
1,0,"i 've used , i 've used remote controls , for things like t_v_ and the c_d_ player and video recorder and i i guess they 're they 're pretty neat neat little tools uh . you do n't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel .",15,0.5,0.666379988193512
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.37833982706069946
0,0,"so especially if you 're someone really lazy like me they they 're pretty nice . um . i find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if i 'm watching t_v_ i have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the t_v_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . um . and also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they 've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all i really wan na do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .",15,0.5,0.49278998374938965
1,0,"yeah um . i agree with having too many remotes around . my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and i do n't know how to work half of them um . what 's important for me , i guess , is that it 's easy to use and that there 's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you 're doing . and one thing i particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red .",15,0.5,0.5275094509124756
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4842403531074524
1,0,"um , i think there is a way around that ,",15,0.5,0.5917044281959534
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6267033219337463
1,0,"but i know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on ,",15,0.5,0.5503153204917908
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4747084379196167
0,0,"so i it 's just simpler just to just turn around the t_v_ itself , and i think that 's if we 're gon na make a remote control , it should actually work for what it 's doing . so",15,0.5,0.47777852416038513
1,0,"what about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don do n't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ?",15,0.5,0.5518072247505188
0,0,"um i would imagine all of them ,",15,0.5,0.3514174818992615
0,0,i know .,15,0.5,0.4892606735229492
1,0,but we could but it 's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double a_s .,15,0.5,0.5707018375396729
0,0,"yeah , something that does n't",15,0.5,0.48530861735343933
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.42706555128097534
1,0,um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um m_p_ three players now and that kind of thing . um .,15,0.5,0.6238545775413513
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.418168842792511
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.32349979877471924
1,0,"um . okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . so um like you said you do n't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you do n't wan na have five remotes . so how do we work with that ?",15,0.5,0.5728587508201599
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5091781616210938
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.43533754348754883
1,0,"could we get something that just has no does n't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that i 'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off ,",15,0.5,0.526917576789856
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5658251047134399
0,0,channel changing .,15,0.5,0.4162861108779907
1,0,"and maybe that spatially divides it , so it 's like if you 're looki if you 're trying to get the t_v_ on that 's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , i dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we 're gon na make it , but if it 's like all the t_v_ stuff was here ,",15,0.5,0.6739183068275452
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.44839799404144287
1,0,"then all the v_c_r_ stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it 's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together ,",15,0.5,0.5514392852783203
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.33243700861930847
1,0,n that way yeah .,15,0.5,0.630254328250885
1,0,"'cause then you like , i do n't even know what i 'm turning on .",15,0.5,0.5327301025390625
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4202024042606354
1,0,"yeah , and if um if you 'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would n't need to use every day .",15,0.5,0.6084815263748169
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4627087414264679
1,0,"okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .",15,0.5,0.639445424079895
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.3420353829860687
1,0,because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the t_v_s no longer have as well .,15,0.5,0.5698652863502502
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.46885210275650024

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6046319603919983
1,0,'cause you 're gon na m need those special functions occasionally . um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote .,15,0.5,0.6136448383331299

1,0,"uh , well . yes . uh-oh . new thing . oh yeah , uh i have to say something . uh , due to some uh technical problems i have n't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . but i 'll uh make sure that uh happens next time .",15,0.5,0.5355250835418701
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5168556571006775
1,0,okay . about the get,15,0.5,0.5189602971076965
1,0,and i 'll get this one uh in digital uh form too .,15,0.5,0.533249020576477
0,0,"'kay , we 're going to um uh talk about working design . um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . it 's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . mm , it 's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . um , the known technology can make a cost very low . uh , it 's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . and and the components are very uh very cheap . um , uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh led lights , they 're needed and they 're uh everywhere available . uh , again , it 's a fair price . it 's a common uh technology uh , like i told um uh , the circuit board , it 's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it 's it is uh can be made as fast as printing paper . it 's uh it 's all very uh",15,0.5,0.4667249023914337
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4616661071777344

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5329556465148926
0,0,"and it 's not uh very specialised uh technology . i have n't come to here , but um i 've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . they were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . so i do n't know uh why i should put it here . uh",15,0.5,0.4814226031303406
1,0,okay . but it 's the technical side of the remote control .,15,0.5,0.5052781701087952
0,0,"yes , but uh i uh have n't made it because uh of the time .",15,0.5,0.4488826394081116
1,0,"oh . okay . well , we 'll we 'll have to skip that part then .",15,0.5,0.5499765872955322
0,0,what ?,15,0.5,0.402949720621109
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5261675119400024
1,0,but you do n't think it 's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? it 's gon na be easy ?,15,0.5,0.5554442405700684
0,0,no . yes .,15,0.5,0.4410940408706665
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6395257711410522
1,0,but nothing restricted for user interface ?,15,0.5,0.5133652687072754
1,0,yeah . m,15,0.5,0.566411018371582
1,0,with technical,15,0.5,0.548440158367157
1,0,"um , no , it 's uh it 's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5284334421157837
0,0,i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.4083752930164337
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5361856818199158
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.4522456228733063
1,0,remote control is nothing special nowadays .,15,0.5,0.7467350363731384
0,0,r regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . does n't really matter .,15,0.5,0.32304883003234863
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5058741569519043
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.5607593655586243
1,0,but i kind of uh,15,0.5,0.5537915229797363
0,0,"i do n't think so ,",15,0.5,0.4888903796672821
1,0,"okay . yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.6086192727088928
1,0,"because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions ,",15,0.5,0.5799555778503418
1,0,yes . uh,15,0.5,0.5372654795646667
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5276644825935364
1,0,but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ?,15,0.5,0.6039041876792908
0,0,"well , we 'll see . we 'll see later on .",15,0.5,0.49828240275382996
1,0,"well , the technical functions . um , well i do n't know if you got the same uh pictures as i got ,",15,0.5,0.5042155981063843
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.4761514663696289
1,0,"but uh i got these two ,",15,0.5,0.5269781947135925
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5629925727844238
1,0,"and i think they 're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . th i think it 's it 's very much uh depending on the user requirements , i do n't s uh know who 's doing t",15,0.5,0.5497235655784607
1,0,"well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? the ones i i 've uh received from the account manager .",15,0.5,0.5602864027023315
1,0,"yeah , but it i think that 's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control .",15,0.5,0.6155492663383484
0,0,"yeah . well , we 'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on .",15,0.5,0.4107826054096222
1,0,"yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it .",15,0.5,0.6402680277824402
1,0,"uh-huh . okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v",15,0.5,0.567695677280426
1,0,"yes , i agree . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5518074631690979
0,0,"yeah ? well , what that 's what you want trying to say .",15,0.5,0.4740179181098938
1,0,"well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user .",15,0.5,0.5481336712837219
0,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.33095574378967285
1,0,but i do n't know . it 's it 's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use .,15,0.5,0.6422321796417236
0,0,"yeah , well some of these uh , yeah . well , some of that will yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements .",15,0.5,0.4135740399360657
1,0,"yeah , probably , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6455298662185669
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.559389591217041
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.608565092086792
1,0,"uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . i think that 's just basic what we need .",15,0.5,0.5217512845993042
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6055781245231628
1,0,"and from that on we can user requirements what we need more . uh yeah , i just um um i thought joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and i do n't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it 's com becoming less trendy or something like that .",15,0.5,0.5456057190895081
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.47009286284446716
1,0,m you can just you can k,15,0.5,0.6784935593605042
1,0,i have n't really found a conclusion like that .,15,0.5,0.5358222723007202
0,0,you can keep it in mind that .,15,0.5,0.420425146818161
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6877519488334656
1,0,"i do n't know . uh , i th i thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh",15,0.5,0.5529661178588867
1,0,design .,15,0.5,0.6061845421791077
0,0,"yeah , more trendier design , i think . i think .",15,0.5,0.4677415192127228
1,0,sounds interesting .,15,0.5,0.533845067024231
1,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.5873939990997314
0,0,"uh , well , that 's all i have to say , i think .",15,0.5,0.48538392782211304
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5094141960144043
1,0,"yeah , that was it .",15,0.5,0.5455304384231567
1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.5878975987434387
1,0,"well , then the marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market .",15,0.5,0.593675971031189
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.49512210488319397
0,0,.,15,0.5,0.4840201437473297
1,0,"yeah . it 's alright . um alright , i 've done some research for functional requirements . um yes . the working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . uh , i 've lined them up here . uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . i uh have found some interesting things . we do we do got a market . um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . so if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as i uh quoted here from the uh results . zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . that 's quite a lot . um , relevant options are , of course , power buttons . although , only used once per hour . uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . that does n't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . but it sure um says we should n't make it too uh complicated . fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . and um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . and uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . so , what i was thinking oh , wrong side . we should n't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . group features for a higher usability , uh what i was claiming in the previous meeting . um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there .",15,0.5,0.53976970911026
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.3948674499988556
1,0,"and um , if you want to implement v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ options , group them in the button , not too uh yeah . small buttons , so they wo n't be very um , how do you say",15,0.5,0.5022498965263367
1,0,visually presents .,15,0.5,0.5224745273590088
1,0,"yes , wo n't be very present , thank you . and a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who do n't really care for trendy looks or whatever , i guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . that was kind of what i found .",15,0.5,0.5476272106170654
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.3433559238910675
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4729393422603607
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5595586895942688
1,0,"well , then we i 'm gon na show you some of the new project requirements and then we gon na discuss on uh what features we find important .",15,0.5,0.5568500757217407
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.48806872963905334
1,0,"uh , well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , i think .",15,0.5,0.6439909934997559
1,0,"because um uh s decided to put they have decide to put two additional requirements forward . well , now i see four .",15,0.5,0.5066961050033569
1,0,two ?,15,0.5,0.590450644493103
0,0,"that 's kinda strange . well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . well , i think that may be so , but well , we ca n't just leave the teletext button off .",15,0.5,0.4585874080657959
1,0,well,15,0.5,0.5624372363090515
0,0,"it 's impossible , i think .",15,0.5,0.4856816530227661
1,0,no way .,15,0.5,0.5845743417739868
0,0,"no uh , i agree , i agree .",15,0.5,0.46118852496147156
1,0,"so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and do n't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or",15,0.5,0.5911001563072205
0,0,"not too much , no .",15,0.5,0.4557934105396271
0,0,"you know , it 's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much .",15,0.5,0.4587614834308624
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.36869892477989197
1,0,"so we have to think of that . the remote control should only be used for television . otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . so maybe we should leave all d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ related features off completely .",15,0.5,0.6466084718704224
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.508918821811676
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5680691599845886
0,0,i do n't know . i think that uh that 's what they 're trying to say .,15,0.5,0.42456555366516113
1,0,"uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . new products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . so you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested .",15,0.5,0.5746578574180603

1,0,"i do n't really agree actually , to be honest . it 's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . it 's only like thirty percent of the total market .",15,0.5,0.6362158060073853
0,0,"yeah , but it is it 's is a dif it 's a fact that the th th that bigger market you 're talking about , we already cover that .",15,0.5,0.3568451404571533
0,0,mayb yeah ?,15,0.5,0.4891761541366577
1,0,"our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . that 's the one we have n't covered yet . so i think that 's what the problem is . we have n't got remote controls for uh",15,0.5,0.5584996938705444
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4390491247177124
1,0,"well i think , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6317375898361206
0,0,maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit .,15,0.5,0.42666032910346985
1,0,"yeah , i think so . maybe if it 's",15,0.5,0.6404543519020081
1,0,"not too much then , bu alright .",15,0.5,0.5102611780166626
1,0,"no no , but i think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . so maybe we can make a remote control that 's primarily interesting for the younger group , but is n't that bad for an older person either .",15,0.5,0.5916654467582703
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5029971599578857

1,0,but what 's our slogan ?,15,0.5,0.5457146167755127
1,0,"sorry ? yeah , you will have to look that up .",15,0.5,0.6181907057762146

0,0,"okay well , let 's go back to the the agenda . so we 've now had to the three presentations . we know about the new project requirements . that means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . well , if i can uh make a start , i think it 's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it 's gon na be , and i already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . i think we 're we 're looking for some",15,0.5,0.43044307827949524
0,0,"yeah , we we 're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic t_v_ functions . y well , that",15,0.5,0.4752097725868225
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3948289453983307
1,0,"well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that 's not very uh yeah , we do n't really need to have a simple remote control .",15,0.5,0.5821893811225891
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6055870652198792
1,0,"i think we can implement more functions then , because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology",15,0.5,0.535460889339447
0,0,"yeah , but wha",15,0.5,0.4145735800266266
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6272227764129639
1,0,and therefore will be a more,15,0.5,0.5221551656723022
1,0,"m yeah , that 's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , i think they are are c are contradicting each other ,",15,0.5,0.561653196811676
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5300205945968628
1,0,"because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just t_v_ , but they s do aim at a younger",15,0.5,0.5276898145675659
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5495913028717041
1,0,"well , ma",15,0.5,0.5959988832473755
1,0,"yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions are n't used .",15,0.5,0.6157611608505249
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6305069923400879
1,0,so why should j we put this function in ?,15,0.5,0.5155839920043945
0,0,"well , i think",15,0.5,0.47994744777679443
1,0,i think more i think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions .,15,0.5,0.6077238917350769
0,0,"but i think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have y well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t t_v_ and a d_v_d_ player .",15,0.5,0.40284639596939087
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4398795962333679
1,0,"you can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the t_v_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . we do n't want that . i think that was that became clear . we do n't want . but w maybe we should put some func uh , i know that the younger people will most likely have a d_v_d_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh",15,0.5,0.5557961463928223
1,0,"yeah , control .",15,0.5,0.5311010479927063
0,0,"yeah , but uh you said",15,0.5,0.40769392251968384
1,0,"control , remotely .",15,0.5,0.6564679741859436
1,0,"yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we 're making .",15,0.5,0.5109700560569763
0,0,"no , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the the new project requirements told us not to",15,0.5,0.4637672007083893
1,0,it 's n yeah .,15,0.5,0.5758168697357178
1,0,but maybe w yeah . i think we maybe should,15,0.5,0.5823314785957336
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6287934184074402
1,0,"yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . but just the basic functions . maybe like rewind and wind ,",15,0.5,0.5583242774009705
1,0,or n what d what do you guys think ?,15,0.5,0.5987697839736938
0,0,but you can put them under the same button .,15,0.5,0.41274377703666687
1,0,not much more than that .,15,0.5,0.5538198947906494
1,0,"yeah , if as far as possible .",15,0.5,0.5723300576210022
0,0,yep . or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever .,15,0.5,0.4234679937362671
1,0,but what do you think ?,15,0.5,0.6348781585693359
0,0,so t,15,0.5,0.493832528591156
1,0,do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ?,15,0.5,0.5954483151435852
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5208795070648193
1,0,"no , you do n't think so ?",15,0.5,0.5884683728218079
1,0,"no , new requirements say no .",15,0.5,0.5752189755439758
1,0,"yeah , the new requirements say so .",15,0.5,0.5383617877960205
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5855329632759094
1,0,but you can put a play and stop and and rewind .,15,0.5,0.5345448851585388
1,0,"well , maybe it 's",15,0.5,0.568282961845398
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5074760317802429
1,0,maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions do n't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control .,15,0.5,0.6250972747802734
0,0,"yeah , but",15,0.5,0.3887973725795746
1,0,"you know , a lot of d_v_d_ players have some tricky settings with",15,0.5,0.6705902814865112
0,0,"yes , but we",15,0.5,0.3457639217376709
1,0,"i i if it 's too simple uh th they wo n't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions .",15,0.5,0.7628463506698608
0,0,y yes .,15,0.5,0.3443883955478668
0,0,"yep , exactly . that 's that 's wha",15,0.5,0.48963460326194763
1,0,"but but for for example , v_c_r_ , that 's better example in this case . i think on a remote control for television you do n't need to be able to programme uh the v_c_r_ to start recording at three p_m_ or whatever ,",15,0.5,0.5369725227355957
0,0,"no no , you do n't no no , you do n't need it . no , no .",15,0.5,0.4470832645893097
0,0,"no , no . exactly .",15,0.5,0.4988080859184265
1,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.5478506088256836
0,0,"just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward .",15,0.5,0.40695080161094666
1,0,"okay , but we have to think uh w we have to think d_v_d_ i th uh , i guess ,",15,0.5,0.5801069140434265
1,0,"yeah , i know , but uh",15,0.5,0.5630037188529968
1,0,"so um but uh from my experience it 's kinda a lot of d_v_d_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . it 's c sometimes a bit difficult .",15,0.5,0.5168306231498718
1,0,"mm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5176181793212891
1,0,"maybe if we just leave the d_v_d_ functional m uh well , i was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , i think we m should focus on the t_v_ then .",15,0.5,0.6061192750930786
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4602489769458771
1,0,"yeah , but just keep it simple and look more at th",15,0.5,0.5791796445846558
1,0,"and uh and it 's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . if you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote .",15,0.5,0.6456586122512817
0,0,no . it 's only for television . so,15,0.5,0.45480653643608093
1,0,"okay . it 's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table ,",15,0.5,0.5452417135238647
0,0,"yes , but there are there are",15,0.5,0.49734100699424744
1,0,"and it 's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .",15,0.5,0.5866397619247437
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.42031848430633545
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5860721468925476
1,0,"yeah , nothing more . exactly .",15,0.5,0.5226441621780396

0,0,"um , but what televis",15,0.5,0.34860339760780334
1,0,but how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? there are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have,15,0.5,0.6684994697570801
0,0,"yeah , we we 'll make w this one trendy .",15,0.5,0.3289753794670105
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5419995188713074
1,0,and simple .,15,0.5,0.6812452673912048
1,0,the user interface is easy .,15,0.5,0.5979013442993164
1,0,"well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . so we should put uh zap buttons on it . um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels .",15,0.5,0.601808488368988
1,0,"and the basic yeah , basic functions , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6086744666099548

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5795383453369141
1,0,probably .,15,0.5,0.5701608061790466
0,0,"yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . i think stop function is very useful . if you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader ,",15,0.5,0.47623181343078613
1,0,"oh , okay .",15,0.5,0.6198865175247192
0,0,"then i think it 's very irritating if the next page shows up , but",15,0.5,0.49980637431144714
1,0,"yeah , but uh i think that becomes too difficult , it 's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then .",15,0.5,0.662941575050354

0,0,look at the market .,15,0.5,0.41323694586753845
1,0,we just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . yeah . i do n't know . i think that that 's kin getting too complex for our remote .,15,0.5,0.5018543601036072

0,0,"okay . so uh , if you could open the powerpoint presentation .",15,0.5,0.46114933490753174
1,0,i 'm number two .,15,0.5,0.6139116883277893
1,0,you 're number two . 'kay,15,0.5,0.6169075965881348
0,0,"components design , there we go .",15,0.5,0.47116783261299133
1,0,so uh can we put it in slide show mode ? yeah .,15,0.5,0.5830474495887756
0,0,the next one .,15,0.5,0.46353042125701904
1,0,"right here , is that little that one , yes please .",15,0.5,0.6213539242744446
0,0,thank you .,15,0.5,0.44859883189201355
0,0,i 'll take the mouse . so uh,15,0.5,0.40936747193336487
1,0,"we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition ,",15,0.5,0.5822414755821228
0,0,"you have to have microphone well no you do n't actually i have n't have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way",15,0.5,0.40944790840148926
1,0,it has to it has to hear the speaker,15,0.5,0.609847903251648
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4833052456378937
1,0,"and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it 's gets lost . um so the other w thing that we so . our method for going about this is we 've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what 's worked , what has n't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials",15,0.5,0.5444076657295227
1,0,"and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing did n't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research .",15,0.5,0.6431781053543091
0,0,"so um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design .",15,0.5,0.3829081058502197
1,0,"course , you know , i wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh does n't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore ,",15,0.5,0.6872149109840393
0,0,"so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that 's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor",15,0.5,0.48530855774879456
0,0,"and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it 's uh goes with the board . uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it 's brittle it gets brittle after a while ,",15,0.5,0.4301745295524597
1,0,"so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium 's also been eliminated uh ,",15,0.5,0.580778956413269
1,0,"the m people in manufacturing said that you could n't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how apple did it with th powerbook i 'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they 've eliminated all of our options except wood .",15,0.5,0.5201919674873352
0,0,at least it 's environmentally friendly .,15,0.5,0.3413744568824768
1,0,"so , this is our finding .",15,0.5,0.5993970632553101
0,0,"and a as she said , it 's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we 're we 're currently uh proposing ,",15,0.5,0.4761934280395508
0,0,uh we 'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second .,15,0.5,0.46606966853141785
0,0,"so then there 's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board ,",15,0.5,0.49308428168296814
0,0,"uh these simple chips , but that 's only works for the bu you do n't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . and um then there was the regular which i regret that i 've forgotten exactly why i 'm eliminating that one . uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender ,",15,0.5,0.46976107358932495
1,0,which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip .,15,0.5,0.7020615935325623
0,0,"and uh manufacturing has told us that they 've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um i i 'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um ,",15,0.5,0.4784025549888611
1,0,"you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . i think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then i uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . so this is the findings of our research",15,0.5,0.6169076561927795
0,0,and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . do you have any problems with that ?,15,0.5,0.4902731478214264
0,0,can you go back uh one slide ?,15,0.5,0.44029122591018677
1,0,"i 'm not sure , how do i oh , i know , let 's see .",15,0.5,0.692597508430481
0,0,thank you . yeah .,15,0.5,0.42532601952552795
1,0,let 's go back up here .,15,0.5,0.5827100872993469
0,0,"yes , uh question , uh , what 's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? what 's the meaning of that ?",15,0.5,0.4687758684158325
1,0,i think it 's um um a multiple uh chip design um and it 's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board .,15,0.5,0.5661359429359436
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.569023847579956
0,0,uh i could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting .,15,0.5,0.4980921447277069
1,0,"yeah , is it means it 's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh",15,0.5,0.6674305200576782
1,0,"i do n't know , but i 'll find out more at our next meeting .",15,0.5,0.5698583126068115
0,0,"okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good .",15,0.5,0.48247846961021423
0,0,sounds good .,15,0.5,0.44969138503074646
1,0,why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ?,15,0.5,0.5626195669174194
0,0,"because um it gets brittle , cracks",15,0.5,0.4729280173778534
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.44219598174095154
1,0,um we want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . so . good ex good expression .,15,0.5,0.5834404230117798

1,0,good expression . well after us .,15,0.5,0.5279254913330078
1,0,"i do n't know , speak for yourself , i 'm planning to be around for a while .",15,0.5,0.5263898372650146
1,0,although i think,15,0.5,0.6784553527832031
0,0,"i think with wood though you 'd run into the same types of problems , would n't you , i mean it chips , it if you drop it ,",15,0.5,0.4150143265724182
1,0,uh it 's i 'm not su,15,0.5,0.6401067972183228
1,0,"so so you 're not convinced about the the wood , yes .",15,0.5,0.5005548596382141
1,0,you 're what ?,15,0.5,0.5151610970497131
1,0,"actually , i 'm ready to sell it .",15,0.5,0.6523391604423523
0,0,"i think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work ,",15,0.5,0.4918880760669708
0,0,i 'm ready to sell it .,15,0.5,0.3889385461807251
1,0,"you think ? and you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it .",15,0.5,0.6243925094604492
1,0,but you ca n't just use,15,0.5,0.5445316433906555
0,0,"no y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood ,",15,0.5,0.4657125473022461
0,0,"yeah , exactly , yeah .",15,0.5,0.41452646255493164
1,0,but there are some very pretty woods out there .,15,0.5,0.5263996720314026
1,0,well i 'm glad you,15,0.5,0.5003777146339417
1,0,that 's actually very innovative idea .,15,0.5,0.5620957016944885
0,0,"okay , good .",15,0.5,0.4161522090435028
1,0,sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face .,15,0.5,0.7119937539100647
0,0,"well , it 's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood .",15,0.5,0.3651789724826813
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.47060999274253845
0,0,the stain .,15,0.5,0.4356376826763153
1,0,"i mean it 's each person is gon na have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that 's not on the market .",15,0.5,0.6496407985687256
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3239358961582184
1,0,"yeah , so it it 's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ?",15,0.5,0.5322248339653015
1,0,"um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own",15,0.5,0.6175940036773682
1,0,"yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first",15,0.5,0.5935379862785339
1,0,in turns of wow .,15,0.5,0.6178427934646606
1,0,she works in the cubicle next to me so she 's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this .,15,0.5,0.5367723107337952
1,0,y yeah .,15,0.5,0.6696844696998596
1,0,luckily ed was not .,15,0.5,0.6464992165565491
1,0,wood ?,15,0.5,0.5596226453781128
0,0,"i think we can get the quality materials then it should n't influence the design principles too much , which you 'll see with my presentation .",15,0.5,0.30424267053604126
1,0,one thing we 'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh,15,0.5,0.6302738189697266
0,0,"mm-hmm . yeah , you would n't wan na have to have splinters in your hand while you 're using your",15,0.5,0.4180815517902374
0,0,"yeah , for example . so , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that ,",15,0.5,0.45033344626426697
1,0,"it 's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething .",15,0.5,0.5735124349594116
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5897350907325745
1,0,"they do that anyway with the rubber and plastic ,",15,0.5,0.5064382553100586
0,0,"yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4863406717777252
0,0,"so , and chew 'em up . and chew 'em up .",15,0.5,0.46743056178092957
1,0,"okay then , uh , let 's move to agnes .",15,0.5,0.5111648440361023
1,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.5788261890411377
0,0,"oh , i 'm sorry .",15,0.5,0.46128541231155396
1,0,s you 're,15,0.5,0.5894594788551331
0,0,you are in participant three .,15,0.5,0.4642036259174347
1,0,"one point three , yeah",15,0.5,0.5849950909614563
1,0,"uh , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5556768178939819
1,0,this one ?,15,0.5,0.5656031370162964
0,0,"i think so , yeah . yeah , that 's the one . so , it 's a very short presentation , 'cause i 'm actually gon na draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of",15,0.5,0.4248586595058441
1,0,"i took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which i completely agree with christine 's idea to have it sort of molded , so it 's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .",15,0.5,0.5995644927024841
0,0,"right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example .",15,0.5,0.2260449081659317
1,0,"so , that 's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . um , one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones ,",15,0.5,0.5998747944831848
0,0,"so that you do n't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they 're not pressing the buttons while you 're trying to watch a t_v_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off .",15,0.5,0.39779046177864075
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4048461318016052
1,0,"and also um you had issues with the batteries running out ,",15,0.5,0.5105529427528381
0,0,"so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . and in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition .",15,0.5,0.48028165102005005
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3410855531692505
1,0,"so , in terms of what this thing would actually look like",15,0.5,0.6575223207473755
0,0,"despite working in interface design , i 'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you 'll have to forgive me . you 'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you do n't accidentally turn your t_v_ off while you 're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . and then here you 'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your t_v_",15,0.5,0.32060766220092773
1,0,"and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . so that if the user does n't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you do n't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you .",15,0.5,0.7219492197036743
0,0,mm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.29941755533218384
1,0,"um , so again you can have a little l_c_d_ light somewhere , the flip thing and have i forgotten anything ? i do n't think so . so , as you can see , it 's a very very simple design ,",15,0.5,0.5396515130996704
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5866004228591919
1,0,"which is one of the things i really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .",15,0.5,0.5042665600776672
0,0,a hinge . be like a copper hinge or you know .,15,0.5,0.46785077452659607
1,0,"yeah . but you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you do n't want it to start getting too heavy .",15,0.5,0.6068269610404968
0,0,mm-hmm . mm .,15,0.5,0.3632107079029083
1,0,"but that 's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . as you can see , there 's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences .",15,0.5,0.5784398913383484
0,0,"mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.4485732614994049
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.407687783241272
1,0,"so , that 's pretty much all i had to say , i mean , everything else in terms of design issues . um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control ,",15,0.5,0.6567416191101074
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5494178533554077
0,0,the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it 's used less frequently .,15,0.5,0.4893905520439148
1,0,mm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5594983696937561
0,0,"so once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less i think it should go along those lines .",15,0.5,0.49021968245506287
1,0,"so what 's your , uh , the comments or uh s",15,0.5,0.5091828107833862

'cause i had another comment there . uh the market trend . this is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we 've done , fancy and feel-good , that 's what we 've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that 's easy to use . looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they 're all very similar , they all do the same thing ,",15,0.5,0.4531860053539276
0,0,"we have to have something completely different . okay ? easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it 's a remote that 's easy to use . and i think this is another thing that 's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . so even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . the second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . the second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use .",15,0.5,0.3881048262119293
1,0,"the first one , i see that they put in a display . now there 's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we 're adding all kinds of things in ,",15,0.5,0.5023759603500366
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4785424470901489
1,0,"but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked .",15,0.5,0.5453366637229919
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5763235092163086
0,0,"maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you 're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display",15,0.5,0.42898523807525635
1,0,"context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ or something else is in .",15,0.5,0.5773550271987915
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.4743415117263794
0,0,"okay because i 've seen mostly the standard ones ,",15,0.5,0.41816121339797974
1,0,especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and,15,0.5,0.5806385278701782
0,0,"yeah . now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . the idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you 're doing .",15,0.5,0.4195551872253418
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5960304141044617
0,0,"so maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours",15,0.5,0.45895999670028687
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.61387699842453
1,0,"you know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball ,",15,0.5,0.5484433174133301
1,0,", we might 've",15,0.5,0.5270329713821411
1,0,oh yeah .,15,0.5,0.6131575703620911
0,0,"and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .",15,0.5,0.4854002892971039
1,0,"yeah , so it 's really molded to to your specific",15,0.5,0.5919883847236633
0,0,to t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh,15,0.5,0.38212764263153076
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.561606764793396
1,0,how hard they squeeze ?,15,0.5,0.6927014589309692
0,0,yes you 'd know what kind of wood to get .,15,0.5,0.4608059823513031
0,0,"resistance resistance , right .",15,0.5,0.3817262053489685
1,0,but th for that you 'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote .,15,0.5,0.5848718285560608
0,0,"that 's right , that 's right , you would n't wan na go too far down that . oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4878328740596771
1,0,"the sales , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5998127460479736
1,0,the yeah . i hope so .,15,0.5,0.5898644328117371
1,0,"no , but incorporating the three uh obviously it 'd be something totally new on the market , totally different",15,0.5,0.5720773339271545
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5629295706748962
1,0,and from,15,0.5,0.5678132176399231
1,0,"well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick .",15,0.5,0.5229063630104065
0,0,"although , what it was it uh it was uh nokia that came out with this changeable colours .",15,0.5,0.38711026310920715
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7096442580223083
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5286341309547424
1,0,"right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face",15,0.5,0.5455454587936401
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5549294948577881
0,0,"right , mm .",15,0.5,0.41772904992103577
1,0,"and that took off , yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5449813008308411
1,0,"and then they sold millions , millions . so . so say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new .",15,0.5,0.570806622505188
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4861237108707428
1,0,we have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market .,15,0.5,0.5903027057647705
1,0,"we 'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gon na get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wan na um learn about um labour laws .",15,0.5,0.5107397437095642
1,0,"you know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you do n't wan na exploit uh labour in um third world countries .",15,0.5,0.5544127225875854
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6621530055999756
1,0,so actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you 're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you 're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device .,15,0.5,0.5458490252494812
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6158149838447571
0,0,"yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , india",15,0.5,0.4847469627857208
1,0,cost of living is low .,15,0.5,0.6923627853393555
1,0,"yes , yes , countries like india or china or malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . so",15,0.5,0.5184528231620789
0,0,"good , well th that 'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more",15,0.5,0.4848516881465912
1,0,"yeah , yeah , so yes .",15,0.5,0.5783001780509949
1,0,mm yeah .,15,0.5,0.5162298083305359
1,0,and to where,15,0.5,0.6964264512062073
0,0,where w where it would be manufactured is is another step .,15,0.5,0.484866201877594
0,0,"so yeah , so",15,0.5,0.41846993565559387
1,0,yeah,15,0.5,0.625446081161499
1,0,"we 're here to design , come up with a nice product .",15,0.5,0.5928649306297302
1,0,"yes uh , but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay .",15,0.5,0.5877333283424377
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4093511998653412
1,0,"so we do n't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something ,",15,0.5,0.5705747604370117
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.49792659282684326
1,0,"so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . so , but uh le let 's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh ed was talking . and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so",15,0.5,0.5008820295333862
1,0,"mm-hmm . i think it depends , i mean i think it 's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it 's gon na be because theoretically with the t_v_ you already have a big display right in front of you .",15,0.5,0.592540442943573
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4971639811992645
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4216272532939911
1,0,"so , if we 're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .",15,0.5,0.7232747673988342
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3894244134426117
1,0,i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for,15,0.5,0.706977903842926
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.41650378704071045
1,0,"very specifically what it would be used for ,",15,0.5,0.6372660398483276
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4473116099834442
1,0,"'cause if it 's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that 's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go ,",15,0.5,0.6331135034561157
0,0,"but that 's just sort of speculation , i mean .",15,0.5,0.4177284240722656
1,0,"what do you think ed ? do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ?",15,0.5,0.5987085103988647
1,0,no . no,15,0.5,0.5052674412727356
1,0,do you wan na take an action item to go find out ?,15,0.5,0.5018588304519653
1,0,no p spec it 's 'cause we have to find out cost on it .,15,0.5,0.5187297463417053
1,0,okay . sorry about that .,15,0.5,0.630178689956665
0,0,"um , no that 's no problem . i 'm here for the pushing it after it 's made .",15,0.5,0.4502529501914978
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.6142621040344238
1,0,i will market it .,15,0.5,0.6884123682975769
1,0,once we get a price on it then we can market it .,15,0.5,0.5620042085647583
0,0,so the the advanced chip on print is what um what we 've we 've deci we 've determined,15,0.5,0.3280803859233856
1,0,"and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um i think we 've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case .",15,0.5,0.6399036645889282

1,0,nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case .,15,0.5,0.5126065015792847
0,0,"what about the buttons , would would the buttons be wood too , or",15,0.5,0.31954261660575867
1,0,"uh i do n't think so , no ,",15,0.5,0.5696665644645691
1,0,i do n't think so .,15,0.5,0.5368478298187256
1,0,"i think they could be rubber like they are now ,",15,0.5,0.5567870140075684
1,0,yes . yes .,15,0.5,0.5387136936187744
1,1,what is the goal of the project ?,15,0.5,0.5176835060119629
1,0,"uh the goal of the project i think maybe i 'll uh hand out to the ed , okay , so to explain uh what is the project because he 's in the sales and the accounting .",15,0.5,0.5278393626213074
1,0,"i 'm in the sales i 'm supposed to explain them what to do . we have to define exactly what our product is , from uh",15,0.5,0.5801222324371338
1,0,"yes , so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ?",15,0.5,0.5867311358451843
0,0,"from what i had in mind we 're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ?",15,0.5,0.4392628073692322
1,0,"oh i think uh , if i 'm not wrong , we 're making the remote control .",15,0.5,0.727201521396637
0,0,um i was wondering,15,0.5,0.31399238109588623
1,0,"remote controls , 'cause i had two different things . i had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward i had a discussion about coffee so",15,0.5,0.6411659717559814
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.2845665514469147
1,0,we 'll start with the remote control for television then . so we 're have to design something that is very user friendly .,15,0.5,0.6935877203941345
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3876988887786865

0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.37914276123046875
1,0,"because i think everybody 's experienced with uh remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window . uh th most of them ar i do n't know we 're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use ,",15,0.5,0.6403988599777222
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.35149088501930237

1,0,"um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given . uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . um it 's also an item that people lose a lot . so we should address that . and , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive ,",15,0.5,0.5626604557037354
1,0,"or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that 's a very important fact , 'cause um if they say , well , i go home and think about it , that wo n't work . um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve . and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan .",15,0.5,0.5309027433395386

1,0,"that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . if too many buttons are pressed , mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item . francino who is our um",15,0.5,0.6444343328475952

1,0,"okay . alright . that would be okay . so um does that make sense ? so what i basically got is i just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 'cause certainly there 's lots of different information to go through . so um i 'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . um and then , as i say uh w we 'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um",15,0.5,0.6117941737174988

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.45748230814933777
1,0,"so this is what i 've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we 'll just read through together . um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . so they find them ugly . most people find them ugly . um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we 'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .",15,0.5,0.6878731846809387

1,0,"okay i 'm gon na we 'll look at that in a second . um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . so i guess what we 're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they do n't does n't really appeal to them .",15,0.5,0.644189715385437
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.30669155716896057
1,0,"so i think what we 're doing is we 're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that 's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people 's hands . um , frustrations . they get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . um , takes time to learn how to use them . this is uh why i mention when craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it does n't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . if you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . um and i will admit i do n't know what r_s_i_ stands for .",15,0.5,0.6286526918411255

0,0,"uh , no , that did not come up at all . um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . i also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . so i dunno if that 's possible we might consider getting into it . um . and and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wan na sell and market this , i think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that 's fashionable and sleek and trendy .",15,0.5,0.4432235360145569

1,0,"yeah , so you know just c looking at what what craig um craig 's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wan na do is try and um separate the different things that we wan na include in this . so if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . you know , it 's like like i find a lot of t_v_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wan na just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there 's just like tons of features you go through .",15,0.5,0.7007398009300232

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6231697201728821
0,0,"the whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up .",15,0.5,0.4741153419017792
1,0,good .,15,0.5,0.6468408703804016
0,0,um and then at the bottom we have our logo . um bright yellow sort of design with the r_r_ which will actually look like our logo .,15,0.5,0.48310232162475586
1,0,great .,15,0.5,0.6239063739776611

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5619469881057739
1,0,i do n't think they 're scrolling .,15,0.5,0.5396885275840759
0,0,no . they 're just buttons .,15,0.5,0.3972892463207245
1,0,"right , yeah . and then yeah , the buttons .",15,0.5,0.5751691460609436
0,0,"on off switch will be here and as you 've noticed on our prototype um they 've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , ca n't see underneath .",15,0.5,0.46642857789993286
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.611441433429718
0,0,"so i 'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they 're very nice to stock you know , stick your finger in . um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute ,",15,0.5,0.43900665640830994
1,0,thumb-shaped .,15,0.5,0.5536617636680603
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5985483527183533
1,0,"and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side .",15,0.5,0.5438656210899353
1,0,"yeah . and then the last thing is just that it 'll be black labelling on top , just which we did n't do .",15,0.5,0.5833721160888672
0,0,"okay . and did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gon na be a single or a double ?",15,0.5,0.44319984316825867

1,0,"and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what 's going on . um what we are gon na talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it 's a t_v_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh r_ and d_ for that , that 's research and development for those that have n't heard that before ,",15,0.5,0.5955395698547363
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5760554671287537
1,0,"see i 'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . um yeah , we 're gon na hear your uh th three little presentations ,",15,0.5,0.5125104188919067
1,0,whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .,15,0.5,0.6053324341773987

0,0,um i 'd like to um hear,15,0.5,0.4855915904045105
1,0,o i 'd like to hear who 's g who 's on the um from from uh catherine actually first . i want what i 'd like to hear about is uh if we 've finally decided on um what sort of energy we 're gon na be using and,15,0.5,0.5355604290962219
1,0,batteries .,15,0.5,0.6994680166244507
0,0,i think she is still finishing her .,15,0.5,0.3995702564716339
1,0,"no no no no , it 's fine i 'm just preparing .",15,0.5,0.5257248878479004
0,0,"it 's just that yeah , let 's let 's hear from you first .",15,0.5,0.453406423330307
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5817774534225464
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3352962136268616
1,0,where is that thing ?,15,0.5,0.7249316573143005
0,0,"okay , it 's uh",15,0.5,0.3997073769569397
0,0,it 's here .,15,0.5,0.4862141013145447
1,0,"oh sorry , could n't see .",15,0.5,0.6479595899581909
1,0,would that work ?,15,0.5,0.6312333941459656
0,0,get yourself in position .,15,0.5,0.43802160024642944
0,0,"okay , so that 's me again .",15,0.5,0.4615733325481415
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.42444729804992676
1,0,"um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which would n't be v would n't be v v",15,0.5,0.5513815879821777
0,0,i do n't think any of us remember the fifties .,15,0.5,0.39563819766044617
1,0,is it like a crank thing or something .,15,0.5,0.5709918141365051
1,0,"yeah , yeah . it would n't be very fancy .",15,0.5,0.5325567126274109
1,0,"you can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . so if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work .",15,0.5,0.5596349239349365
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3254799246788025
1,0,"or you can use solar cells , but i 'm not sure about that indoors , really , but",15,0.5,0.5547356605529785
0,0,"well , there 's sometimes combinations , i mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .",15,0.5,0.4083595871925354
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5470294952392578
1,0,"do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ?",15,0.5,0.5686002969741821
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.46300745010375977
1,0,does anybody know ?,15,0.5,0.5914419293403625
0,0,i dunno actually .,15,0.5,0.49538078904151917
0,0,"uh i think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but i do n't know .",15,0.5,0.46861082315444946
1,0,"i dunno . um . think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .",15,0.5,0.5347768068313599
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4422817826271057
1,0,"and uh if we want something fancier , i think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice ,",15,0.5,0.5683401823043823
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3887236714363098
1,0,but i do n't know if it 's worth the cost . so we 've got to discuss that .,15,0.5,0.5947465896606445
0,0,"mm . okay , jolly good .",15,0.5,0.3204130530357361
1,0,"for the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . you can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what i mean , so",15,0.5,0.5535203218460083
0,0,what 's a double curved one ?,15,0.5,0.48773008584976196
0,0,"you know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .",15,0.5,0.36374929547309875
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5932496786117554
1,0,"so um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . and th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you ca n't use it for if you if we 're choosing a double curved case , we ca n't choose titanium . and if we are choosing um solar cells then we ca n't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . but if we 're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . and i think we discussed earlier on the r_ s_ i_ problem thing , so we could uh",15,0.5,0.611696183681488
0,0,"so that might be an idea of using the rubber ,",15,0.5,0.4268811047077179
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5116369724273682
0,0,"but then it should , you know",15,0.5,0.4633224308490753
1,0,let 's have a squeezable remote .,15,0.5,0.6042289733886719
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4602113962173462
1,0,"yeah . and also it does n't break as easily maybe ,",15,0.5,0.6141181588172913
0,0,when a t_v_ programme 's got one,15,0.5,0.4173753261566162
1,0,i dunno,15,0.5,0.6567836999893188
0,0,"watching the match and your team 's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it 'll bounce off the wall back at you .",15,0.5,0.40108057856559753
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6320666074752808
1,0,"yeah , i like that idea .",15,0.5,0.6183404326438904
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5649304986000061
1,0,so rubber would be okay .,15,0.5,0.6473104953765869
0,0,i think rubber 's,15,0.5,0.44614845514297485
1,0,"rubber , we 're all we 're all going we 're all liking that idea ? you think you can market that ?",15,0.5,0.5838927626609802
0,0,"but after my after my fashion thing , i think you 'll realise that rubber is more",15,0.5,0.37184014916419983
0,0,"ooh , we like rubber , ooh .",15,0.5,0.47756069898605347
0,0,uh s so if d,15,0.5,0.4179042875766754
1,0,people .,15,0.5,0.6620813608169556
0,0,"okay . and then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um l_c_d_ , which gives you a display . um scroll buttons , as well .",15,0.5,0.3768049478530884
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.6487993597984314
1,0,"so if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . so if we 're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .",15,0.5,0.5464004874229431
0,0,"well , we 're gon na go with i think we 've decided that it 's gon na be a rubber case so",15,0.5,0.47636356949806213
0,0,"so it 's a constraint . yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? if it 's not a double curved , then we 've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it 's a double curve , we 've got ta go for rubber push-buttons . if that makes sense .",15,0.5,0.43184030055999756
0,0,push buttons instead of the wheel ?,15,0.5,0.3572503924369812
1,0,yeah . .,15,0.5,0.6578824520111084
1,0,"if it 's rubber , is n't it malleable anyway , it does n't matter if it 's double i mean is n't a rubber case , mean it 's completely flexed , i mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? mean so what 's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?",15,0.5,0.5040609836578369
0,0,rubble double double .,15,0.5,0.34999334812164307
1,0,"no , but na le you see , you 've got , okay , the energy that 's one thing ,",15,0.5,0.5318731069564819
1,0,"i 'll have a big mac , please .",15,0.5,0.5084767937660217
0,0,"then you have the case is uh , whether it 's flat or curved . and that 's we do n't care if it 's rub rubber or not , but then we 've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . so if we 've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it 's flat , single curved or double curved . and i 'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go i dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . so , either",15,0.5,0.39291873574256897
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4212636947631836
1,0,i dunno we just need to decide on the on the case .,15,0.5,0.5268561840057373
0,0,"let 's have rubber push buttons , hey .",15,0.5,0.3999098539352417
1,0,okay . go rubber . go rubber the whole way .,15,0.5,0.5579138994216919
1,0,"let 's go crazy . and then , do i have a last slide ? yes , i do . um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that 's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons .",15,0.5,0.5397850871086121
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7049066424369812
1,0,"um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gon na be the cheapest . uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that 's a higher price range . if we get an advanced chip which is um used for the l_c_d_ , the display thing , then that 's even more expensive .",15,0.5,0.5649122595787048
0,0,"simple , yeah . chip on print . it 's a bit . okay , uh what i 'm not understanding here",15,0.5,0.407960444688797
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5904605984687805
0,0,"is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which i presume is like one p_c_b_ and that 's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?",15,0.5,0.4876367449760437
1,0,. yeah .,15,0.5,0.6489706039428711
1,0,the infra-red . yeah .,15,0.5,0.7046716213226318
0,0,right . um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?,15,0.5,0.4232533872127533
1,0,"well , if if it 's not chip on print then , i guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and does n't include the infra-red . it 's less expensive mm",15,0.5,0.5214695930480957
1,0,so it sounds,15,0.5,0.6549451947212219
0,0,"technically speaking , it 's not as advanced , but it does the job , too .",15,0.5,0.4990440011024475
1,0,"so , why would we not go for that ? if it 's something that 's inside the the unit . i it does n't affects whether the customer 's gon na buy it or not .",15,0.5,0.6523084044456482
0,0,"fo it does n't , yeah , yeah , yeah . totally . yeah .",15,0.5,0.4565412402153015
1,0,um we wan na go for an i i all,15,0.5,0.5850331783294678
1,0,so let 's not go for the,15,0.5,0.5253112316131592
0,0,"so long as it works ,",15,0.5,0.4856458902359009
1,0,"yeah , yeah . i agree .",15,0.5,0.6501558423042297
0,0,you know . so let 's not let 's uh not bother with the chip on print .,15,0.5,0.4304905831813812
1,0,so it 's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .,15,0.5,0.643122136592865
1,0,"yeah . s yeah , push buttons .",15,0.5,0.5558306574821472
1,0,what about the just developed uh sample sensor ?,15,0.5,0.56329345703125
1,0,i think push-buttons is,15,0.5,0.5006489157676697
1,0,what about what ?,15,0.5,0.6143105626106262
1,0,"g there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .",15,0.5,0.5387715697288513
0,0,well,15,0.5,0.3921419680118561
1,0,"well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?",15,0.5,0.6329503059387207
0,0,"mm , i dunno . be cool .",15,0.5,0.4132213890552521
1,0,"it 'd be it 'd be cool , but they are saying they 've just developed it ,",15,0.5,0.5256152153015137
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6096317172050476
1,0,channel two .,15,0.5,0.5344203114509583
1,0,"i 'm just guessing . but it 's gon na be the most expensive option , probably and",15,0.5,0.5236254930496216
0,0,s,15,0.5,0.42237359285354614
1,0,"th the the speech recognition um option is it does n't seem really very promising for us uh ,",15,0.5,0.6138356328010559
0,0,yeah . it 's not something that we wan na t go into with this product .,15,0.5,0.3628430664539337
0,0,"'cause uh the yeah the example that they 're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um that when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . so you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello rick , or whatever .",15,0.5,0.4838784635066986
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6310957670211792
1,0,"but , i mean , it 's not",15,0.5,0.5577161908149719
0,0,hm .,15,0.5,0.43375077843666077
1,0,"it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t_v_ on like , turn the t_v_ on , and i turns comes on , but it 's not that . it just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response .",15,0.5,0.6389977931976318
0,0,"oh , it just gives an answer .",15,0.5,0.36165016889572144
1,0,"so , yeah , i mean , like what 's the point of saying , hello remote , i mean , hello , how how are you ?",15,0.5,0.5960241556167603
0,0,"oh , then then",15,0.5,0.3933641314506531
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5956131815910339
1,0,"just if you are really lonely , maybe .",15,0.5,0.561618447303772
1,0,i thought i thought it was when they said,15,0.5,0.5255478024482727
0,0,"yeah , if you 're really lonely , it is it 's",15,0.5,0.4489569664001465
1,0,"i thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like ,",15,0.5,0.6479284763336182
0,0,channel five . and then it switches on .,15,0.5,0.44926974177360535
1,0,"channel five , and it will change .",15,0.5,0.5866432189941406
1,0,"no , tha that w that w that would be more promising .",15,0.5,0.6141228079795837
1,0,like you talk to it . can i have channel five ?,15,0.5,0.5009548664093018
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6350882053375244
1,0,it it 's just a remote that talks to you .,15,0.5,0.5183525681495667
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5258830785751343
1,0,uh . i mean to certain cues .,15,0.5,0.5617376565933228
0,0,"oh , then forget about it . oh right okay .",15,0.5,0.43267521262168884
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5560874342918396
0,0,"okay , so i 'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . so for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the",15,0.5,0.49707719683647156
1,0,"'kay . yeah , i 'm fine with the basic battery .",15,0.5,0.5096961259841919
1,0,basic battery .,15,0.5,0.5695465207099915
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.29629844427108765
1,0,"it 's cheap , it 's cheerful , it 's worked , does work .",15,0.5,0.5993053913116455
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.39775875210762024
1,0,cheaper option . are you happy with that ?,15,0.5,0.6055238246917725
0,0,mm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.3499051034450531
1,0,"okay . so we 'll go for the battery . then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?",15,0.5,0.7378424406051636
0,0,"we were go we were going with the late with the the r_s_i_ rubber , were n't we ?",15,0.5,0.3739769458770752
0,0,"yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved .",15,0.5,0.4441305100917816
1,0,the the,15,0.5,0.5013843178749084
1,0,so it will look like something like this .,15,0.5,0.5641462206840515
0,0,double ?,15,0.5,0.4108673632144928
1,0,"the double whopper , please .",15,0.5,0.56187504529953
1,0,"okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons ,",15,0.5,0.537387490272522
0,0,"yep , but we 're going for the simple buttons .",15,0.5,0.31976425647735596
1,0,"so rubber rubber keys , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5961633324623108
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5903701186180115
0,0,and that 's fine ?,15,0.5,0.42664018273353577
1,0,"and it 's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it",15,0.5,0.6281037330627441
0,0,p,15,0.5,0.3869859576225281
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4679045081138611
1,0,"as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the r_ people were getting the complaining about r_s_i_ , and this is anti-r_s_i_ .",15,0.5,0.6922478079795837
0,0,.,15,0.5,0.32314056158065796
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5549185872077942
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5640122294425964
1,0,so that 's another marketing point that we can use .,15,0.5,0.74029940366745
0,0,well the rubber push-buttons . do n't you have to move your,15,0.5,0.4427086114883423
0,0,but anything is gon na have buttons .,15,0.5,0.36147621273994446
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5709003210067749
0,0,"even if it 's a jog wheel , it 's still repetitive . you",15,0.5,0.4849414825439453
0,0,i thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a,15,0.5,0.37933140993118286
0,0,"you see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen .",15,0.5,0.4411134123802185
1,0,that they do n't .,15,0.5,0.6042214632034302
1,0,it 's the v it 's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement .,15,0.5,0.5782076716423035
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4251161515712738
1,0,.,15,0.5,0.5561213493347168
1,0,it 's not actually what you are doing .,15,0.5,0.6014664769172668
1,0,but the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-r_s_i_ ps specific,15,0.5,0.5303294658660889
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3241058886051178
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7294070720672607
0,0,"yeah , the rubber 's good .",15,0.5,0.4603259563446045
0,0,"we 're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah .",15,0.5,0.49880197644233704
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5297587513923645
1,0,"yeah , so they can sit there and go like",15,0.5,0.6094189286231995
1,0,not that watching t_v_ should be that stressful .,15,0.5,0.5800451636314392
0,0,"and you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah .",15,0.5,0.49686649441719055
1,0,"oh yeah , i guess t_v_ can be stressful , yeah , if you 're watching sports .",15,0.5,0.578406572341919
1,0,"alright , that 's me done .",15,0.5,0.6907370686531067
0,0,"okay , gabriel . let 's um let 's let 's hear from you about the um it 's the interface .",15,0.5,0.4655877351760864
1,0,"alright . alright . yeah , some of what i have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about .",15,0.5,0.6246228218078613
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.49827003479003906
1,0,sorry .,15,0.5,0.5574681162834167
1,0,"okay , so i 'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . and so basically i consulted with our manufacturing division . it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them . uh i also took uh reissa 's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause i think that 's that 's crucial as far as uh what keys we 're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they 're laid out .",15,0.5,0.5814594030380249
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.38022130727767944
0,0,"uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . so i already mentioned the speech recognition interface .",15,0.5,0.48319926857948303
1,0,"i guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . it 's it 's pointless .",15,0.5,0.5369413495063782
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.45326176285743713
1,0,"uh it 's just a sample sensor sample output . it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the t_v_ . uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m_p_ three player like ipod .",15,0.5,0.5747110843658447
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.35435041785240173
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.39573532342910767
1,0,um so we 've already addressed that and i think that would actually be worse for something like r_s_i_ i mean you got that thumb movement that you 're constantly doing .,15,0.5,0.5924532413482666
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5563026666641235
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4760534167289734
1,0,"um the other suggestion ,",15,0.5,0.5575583577156067
1,0,that does get annoying .,15,0.5,0.5433236360549927
1,0,"and i i have a feeling that we 're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or ,",15,0.5,0.5200527310371399
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5382717251777649
0,0,"or uh something for the elderly , where the remote 's very large and the buttons are very large and there 's only a few buttons . but you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well .",15,0.5,0.44195184111595154
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5869924426078796
1,0,"uh um so , the key layout and design are really crucial . you do n't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . and i did n't mention that we need a power button in our last i can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout",15,0.5,0.5407006144523621
0,0,"uh from our manufacturing department . so this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a v_ on both of them , so uh",15,0.5,0.4257686138153076
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5973226428031921
1,0,it 's sort of confusing for the user . uh this is the example of the giant remote that 's impossible to lose .,15,0.5,0.6018254160881042
0,0,do we have an uh example of a good one ? brilliant .,15,0.5,0.3386220633983612
0,0,uh-huh . well,15,0.5,0.49612849950790405
1,0,and for something for kids . yeah . um .,15,0.5,0.5296434164047241
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5237947106361389
1,0,"and so , yeah , i th i think my personal preferences of we 've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . uh so i was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . i think it should be more general .",15,0.5,0.5935295224189758
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4256863594055176
1,0,"i did n't i did n't think the spinning-wheel or the uh l_c_ display were were crucial for us . and , yeah , that 's it for me .",15,0.5,0.6482758522033691
0,0,okay . well let 's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? the um the the um the interface type we 're going for,15,0.5,0.49809181690216064
1,0,so we 're we 're not gon na have any sort of display i think uh .,15,0.5,0.5625521540641785
0,0,just the simple s simple straight set of buttons .,15,0.5,0.46280810236930847
0,0,"so , yeah , it 's just gon na be just gon na be push-buttons . um . i think we shall have a limited number of buttons ,",15,0.5,0.4275969862937927
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6147388219833374
1,0,"ideally , i mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .",15,0.5,0.5391817092895508
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6289582848548889
1,0,uh . and some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that .,15,0.5,0.5431694388389587
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4940173327922821
1,0,i guess it 's to the point where we need to decide about that .,15,0.5,0.5344273447990417
1,0,"okay , and we 're not yeah .",15,0.5,0.5319926738739014
1,0,well now that we 've decided on our,15,0.5,0.537609875202179
1,0,are we gon na hav hav an are we d,15,0.5,0.5373362898826599
0,0,"have we decided on whether w we 're gon na s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we 're not we 're just gon na go for something",15,0.5,0.49679863452911377
1,0,"um it seems like we would n't wan na make it too busy and too sort of gaudy ,",15,0.5,0.5798833966255188
1,0,we 're,15,0.5,0.6019230484962463
1,0,maybe we can,15,0.5,0.5123518705368042
0,0,"but um yeah , i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the r_r_ can be yellow , or something like that .",15,0.5,0.4828091561794281
1,0,"yeah . yeah . okay . okey-dokey . yeah , i do n't have any other questions on this . let 's move over to",15,0.5,0.6827902793884277
1,0,i i guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .,15,0.5,0.5194432139396667
1,0,"yeah , sure .",15,0.5,0.5300307869911194
0,0,"i mean , 'cause uh s so if we wan na have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button .",15,0.5,0.43335390090942383
1,0,.,15,0.5,0.5751392245292664
0,0,"but i think that should be i mean um , i can speak with the button department , but uh i think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating .",15,0.5,0.46240514516830444
0,0,"yeah , the button that just does that , yeah .",15,0.5,0.41208502650260925
1,0,so that should be simple .,15,0.5,0.5293521881103516
1,0,cool .,15,0.5,0.5386074185371399
1,0,"right . well , i 'm just basically letting you know what 's happening in the markets",15,0.5,0.5246054530143738
0,0,mm yeah .,15,0.5,0.38901278376579285
1,0,"and what the fashions are for next year . um . so yes , so from looking at this year 's trends and fashions",15,0.5,0.5583861470222473
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4137299060821533
1,0,"and also recent investigation that we 've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to",15,0.5,0.533379077911377
0,0,which we 've already probably discussed . um the most important aspect is look and feel . so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . so it has to be,15,0.5,0.3441515862941742
1,0,"yeah , why should people buy this when they 're already got a remote that came with the t_v_ ?",15,0.5,0.5273752808570862
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.3676172196865082
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5267822742462158
1,0,exactly .,15,0.5,0.5284066796302795
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.578874409198761
1,0,"um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . so",15,0.5,0.6941947937011719
1,0,what 's that mean ?,15,0.5,0.5574561357498169
0,0,"technologically it should be like um work , basically , i guess . it should work .",15,0.5,0.3112281560897827
1,0,"well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense ,",15,0.5,0.6741763949394226
0,0,should,15,0.5,0.3368963897228241
1,0,i mean have something that 's little more technologically advanced than what 's on the market .,15,0.5,0.5727720856666565
0,0,that 's new .,15,0.5,0.46577078104019165
1,0,"okay , now the trouble is is we 've already decided that we 're going with the stuff that works already , that 's cheap .",15,0.5,0.5569524168968201
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5064214468002319
1,0,"yeah . yeah . actually , i mean , these first two points we 've already sort of gone away from ,",15,0.5,0.5738363265991211
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7300147414207458
0,0,'cause our rubber one is not fancy,15,0.5,0.48795267939567566

0,0,it 's it 's easy to learn or how do you say it 's,15,0.5,0.47196608781814575
1,0,thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . yep .,15,0.5,0.5292728543281555
0,0,okay too much time to learn . okay .,15,0.5,0.43100816011428833

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6340157985687256
1,0,yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design .,15,0.5,0.5443891882896423
1,0,hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.551543653011322
1,0,"one thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute .",15,0.5,0.6631086468696594
1,0,because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important .,15,0.5,0.5985554456710815
0,0,mm-hmm . yep .,15,0.5,0.41660887002944946
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4892203211784363
1,0,"um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control .",15,0.5,0.5486930012702942
0,0,speech recognition in,15,0.5,0.36406829953193665
0,0,and who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .,15,0.5,0.4432578980922699
0,0,d do you have numbers o o on that ?,15,0.5,0.3931606709957123

0,0,"yes , i 'll just get this up .",15,0.5,0.4489856958389282
1,0,so that we do n't do we not need any button on the remote control,15,0.5,0.6249377727508545
0,0,"well potentially yeah , um",15,0.5,0.3043515682220459
1,0,it would be all based on speech .,15,0.5,0.6260591745376587
0,0,i think even for interesti,15,0.5,0.3383236229419708
1,0,okay . interesting idea .,15,0.5,0.5299316048622131

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.42395031452178955

0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.37371617555618286

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.33714616298675537

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5548704862594604

1,0,"and we do n't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ?",15,0.5,0.5996329188346863
1,0,"oh . well , it depends you know like there is uh it 's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three ,",15,0.5,0.511732280254364
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3332454264163971

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.562323272228241
1,0,another thing it 's talking about there is the l_c_d_ screen but there 's no figures apparently on that .,15,0.5,0.5633425712585449
0,0,mm . okay . um,15,0.5,0.49187538027763367
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.48498180508613586
1,0,uh maybe uh mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh ?,15,0.5,0.5393727421760559
0,0,yeah . mm i okay,15,0.5,0.48055052757263184
1,0,"oh ,",15,0.5,0.5500161647796631
0,0,i stay,15,0.5,0.4756549000740051
0,0,this is,15,0.5,0.4994126260280609
1,0,now you can move i think yeah .,15,0.5,0.5780802369117737
1,0,"mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh .",15,0.5,0.5651088356971741
1,0,i can move as far as maybe i take your chair ?,15,0.5,0.5375009179115295
1,0,yes . you can you can sa take my chair .,15,0.5,0.5248374938964844
1,0,i okay .,15,0.5,0.5628687143325806
0,0,"it 's a channel selection , a module , this and this function ,",15,0.5,0.4957197904586792
1,0,sorry ? oh .,15,0.5,0.6042454838752747
1,0,go to the . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5414422750473022
1,0,"so i think as everybody knows uh i 'm the uh industrial designer . and uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gon na focus on the working design of the the remote control . um i 'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you do n't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because i think in the product it is important .",15,0.5,0.5683730244636536
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3291771411895752
1,0,so basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed .,15,0.5,0.6602569222450256
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.33714091777801514
1,0,"and so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit",15,0.5,0.5304369330406189
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5592221021652222
1,0,"and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright . so my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that i would wish to to make a really functional product . i would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and does n't work .",15,0.5,0.5577452778816223

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.451077938079834
1,0,so for that yeah as it 's important to take into account the user requirements from the marketing uh expert uh anna,15,0.5,0.5741133093833923
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5782293081283569
0,0,"and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and i show you the the working design . so um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want . uh we want an on off button , it can be uh it 's simple but it 's it 's important , and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after ,",15,0.5,0.499833881855011
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.425333172082901
1,0,"right . so the components i quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that 's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control",15,0.5,0.5609692335128784

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5398274064064026
1,0,"so of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . this is very quick uh design , uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you do n't agree on it on that .",15,0.5,0.5387997031211853
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5971147418022156
1,0,and um so what i have found and after a lot of work actually i i draw this i draw for you this uh schema,15,0.5,0.5551358461380005
0,0,well .,15,0.5,0.434417188167572
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.5288907885551453
1,0,that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me,15,0.5,0.5249805450439453
1,0,you drew it a long time ago ?,15,0.5,0.5341268181800842
1,0,you know .,15,0.5,0.5375970602035522
1,0,is huh,15,0.5,0.5044538974761963
1,0,ninety one .,15,0.5,0.5904655456542969
1,0,and uh that 's it so i wo n't go into details about that,15,0.5,0.5104584097862244
1,0,overwhelming .,15,0.5,0.5816270112991333
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.6578407883644104
1,0,but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components .,15,0.5,0.5695436000823975
0,0,and and why do you want these kind of component ?,15,0.5,0.4863753616809845
1,0,so . so,15,0.5,0.6897485852241516
1,0,"i mean , are they cheap , or are they uh reliable ? what were your",15,0.5,0.5806552767753601
0,0,"found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it 's expensive ,",15,0.5,0.432808518409729
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.37712234258651733
1,0,"but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that 's it for the working design , uh i hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components",15,0.5,0.5776655077934265
0,0,yes . it it it 's more clear now i think .,15,0.5,0.4907221794128418
1,0,but maybe yeah,15,0.5,0.579866349697113
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5216150879859924
1,0,but is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma,15,0.5,0.6738383769989014
1,0,no no no no we we will uh this is a preference but we can always change uh,15,0.5,0.5715506672859192
0,0,"mm-hmm . what i w what i was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , i mean can you can you get back to it ?",15,0.5,0.45390671491622925
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5890025496482849
1,0,"yeah uh , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it . so we we must adapt to the to the receiver .",15,0.5,0.5477672219276428
1,0,of course yeah .,15,0.5,0.5655322074890137
0,0,i i suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh .,15,0.5,0.4909583032131195
1,0,yeah . we will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists,15,0.5,0.583845853805542
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5393974184989929
1,0,and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles .,15,0.5,0.5702708959579468
0,0,mm . mm . mm . mm . yes . okay .,15,0.5,0.46728643774986267
1,0,um . okay .,15,0.5,0.7192655205726624
1,0,thank you .,15,0.5,0.5549117922782898
0,0,well it to du it 's just you had to change the frequencies .,15,0.5,0.4950757622718811
1,0,the frequencies ?,15,0.5,0.5117984414100647
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5297197103500366
1,0,yeah yeah . of course yeah,15,0.5,0.6514621376991272
1,0,"but you should be careful ,",15,0.5,0.5417981147766113
0,0,in the chip you have it yeah .,15,0.5,0.432634174823761
1,0,"people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other t_v_s , so basically through all the things .",15,0.5,0.6025512218475342
0,0,that can control o other things . yeah .,15,0.5,0.48199644684791565
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.3012770712375641
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4423437714576721
1,0,so maybe we should think of,15,0.5,0.5195496678352356
1,0,of course yeah we should take that into account,15,0.5,0.5969948768615723
1,0,that 's handy .,15,0.5,0.5266737341880798
1,0,yeah yes,15,0.5,0.5055810809135437
1,0,"so if the b t_v_ in the next apartment 's really loud , you can just turn it off .",15,0.5,0.620418131351471
0,0,i i i,15,0.5,0.47454607486724854
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5786422491073608
1,0,in the uh,15,0.5,0.6099592447280884
1,0,yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone 's t_v_ and you can just walk away,15,0.5,0.5384595990180969
0,0,you do n't have to be near the t_v_ at all .,15,0.5,0.4416767656803131
1,0,yeah . i like that idea .,15,0.5,0.5138683915138245
1,0,i i feel i i i think m mael will will consider this uh th these things .,15,0.5,0.6342150568962097
0,0,maybe maybe we can go to to your presentation uh matthew .,15,0.5,0.45216429233551025
1,0,yeah,15,0.5,0.6202789545059204
1,0,i i i assume you were finished here .,15,0.5,0.5573149919509888
1,0,so .,15,0.5,0.5582709908485413
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5259667038917542
1,1,"okay . so , now more design .",15,0.5,0.7103086709976196
1,0,right . thank you . mine 's not quite as complicated as all that .,15,0.5,0.5090175867080688
1,0,that 's what we like to hear .,15,0.5,0.5015894770622253
1,0,did i press function ? yeah .,15,0.5,0.614495038986206
1,0,"is it control function ei oh , th there you go .",15,0.5,0.5242342948913574
0,0,"oh . um . okay so i 'm gon na talk a bit about the technical functions design . i 'm louisa , the user interface designer , as you know . um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . um here are two example remotes . um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so i think they incorporate a kind of video function which we wo n't have to worry about . uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . um so my personal preference would be the right remote . so , it 's got nice big buttons , it 's got a very limited number of buttons . um they 're nice , kinda clearly labelled . um i like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . so it 's very very user friendly , and it 's got a little splash of colour . could maybe do with some more colour . um .",15,0.5,0.4423562288284302
1,0,well there 's a couple of things there . um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . so basically we 'd have to uh we 'd have to be putting that on um the the product .,15,0.5,0.5267335176467896
0,0,hmm . do we get to see that ?,15,0.5,0.480637788772583
1,0,"i have n't as yet , no .",15,0.5,0.6780856847763062
0,0,will you be presenting that in a bit ?,15,0.5,0.4453161954879761
1,0,"but uh i got uh i got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . so uh i 'm guessing that uh uh i notice on the bottom there it 's got uh what 's that ? a_p_o_g_e_e_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour i can see in that is the red .",15,0.5,0.6461561322212219
1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5057359933853149
1,0,"would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . so we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . possibly ?",15,0.5,0.5139527320861816
1,0,what do you mean by the circular section ?,15,0.5,0.6499834656715393
0,0,j yeah yeah yeah j yeah,15,0.5,0.4984305500984192
0,0,like all of that bottom bit ?,15,0.5,0.4632367491722107
1,0,"just this little bit is that i think that 's still um a video remote part ,",15,0.5,0.5585792660713196
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6142292022705078
1,0,so maybe we could get rid of that as well .,15,0.5,0.5211861729621887
1,0,yeah . and i do n't really think that you need nine numbers .,15,0.5,0.6134043335914612
1,0,well b uh w,15,0.5,0.5420522093772888
1,0,"i mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? i think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough .",15,0.5,0.5849931240081787
1,0,well th the on the,15,0.5,0.5261719226837158
1,0,like how often do you hit nine ?,15,0.5,0.5381147265434265
1,0,"well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time ,",15,0.5,0.5551230311393738
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6149383187294006
0,0,and we 'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . but but,15,0.5,0.447838693857193
1,0,"it 's just people are used to seeing that , so if we did n't have them then they might think it 's",15,0.5,0.7348885536193848
0,0,"but , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh i mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? i would have thought that uh it 's forever expanding and at the moment we 've got although you 've onl you 've got the five standard , you 've got the b_b_c_ have come up with a further six",15,0.5,0.41781213879585266
1,0,and uh there 's uh i do n't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh sky and various other um various others .,15,0.5,0.5822749733924866
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6313137412071228
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4262547492980957
1,0,"so i would 've thought that we would n't , you know , rather",15,0.5,0.6778120398521423
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3778371512889862
1,0,"okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it 'll take a second",15,0.5,0.6410188674926758
1,0,'cause you have to be able to stop it . maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . y you 'd want you 'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted .,15,0.5,0.5158005952835083
1,0,"um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that 's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five .",15,0.5,0.5687399506568909
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4828696846961975
1,0,"yeah , i s i suppose in a sense you could have um if you 've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty",15,0.5,0.6074451208114624
1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5124949812889099
1,0,and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want,15,0.5,0.5688489079475403
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5824604034423828
1,0,and that would cut down your time .,15,0.5,0.5771664381027222
0,0,mm . um .,15,0.5,0.4529998302459717
1,0,anyway .,15,0.5,0.5434961318969727
1,0,"but i think a lot of um like cable and sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you 'd have another remote for all of those channels .",15,0.5,0.5389643907546997
0,0,"okay , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4777781367301941
1,0,like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers,15,0.5,0.5854542255401611
0,0,whatever .,15,0.5,0.47565048933029175
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5622076392173767
1,0,"okay . okay . limit the number of buttons , user friendly .",15,0.5,0.5365533828735352
0,0,but i suppose nine 's not really excessive .,15,0.5,0.4913140535354614
1,0,i suppose with nine you 've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it 's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number .,15,0.5,0.5925526022911072
1,0,i suppose it does make a good pattern .,15,0.5,0.573808491230011
0,0,so with that we 'd kind of by-pass any problems with,15,0.5,0.4822051227092743
1,0,"yeah well that 's true , yeah ,",15,0.5,0.6409044861793518
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6747856140136719
0,0,"you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense .",15,0.5,0.44724607467651367
1,0,yeah . 'cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need .,15,0.5,0.6452258229255676
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6518206000328064
1,0,um .,15,0.5,0.5457996726036072
1,0,does .,15,0.5,0.5767863988876343
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5196096897125244

0,0,um which is n't really too many . that 'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote .,15,0.5,0.480679988861084
1,0,mm-hmm . well we 've we 've got um that it 's remote for t_v_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations .,15,0.5,0.5095248222351074

1,0,"um so hopefully you 've all been working away , and i 've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . um so i guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the the first one is that um uh the company 's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we do n't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control .",15,0.5,0.5284319519996643
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.44364118576049805
1,0,"um they 've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . i think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it 'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . so um , we 're just gon na keep it simple and it 'll just control the t_v_ .",15,0.5,0.5235251188278198
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.462546706199646
1,0,"and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . um i 'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . it might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere .",15,0.5,0.5487501621246338
1,0,"and the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?",15,0.5,0.5350483655929565
1,0,"well that 's the thing , i 'm i 'm not sure um uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say uh something",15,0.5,0.5555601716041565
1,0,'bout putting the fashion in electronics .,15,0.5,0.5078079104423523
0,0,mm yeah .,15,0.5,0.483754962682724
1,0,"yeah , i mean do they is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it 's quite long . um or yeah , just the idea , but i 'm not sure . so that 's something we can discuss as well . so those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the t_v_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . um so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ?",15,0.5,0.5465763807296753

1,0,"oh yeah , of course , yeah . g go on ahead .",15,0.5,0.6836596727371216
0,0,"so this is the technical functions design . um right to do the um the design i have i 've had a look online , i 've had a look at the homepage , which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products .",15,0.5,0.4734620749950409
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6143296360969543
0,0,"um i 've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um i would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . um unfortunately we 're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so",15,0.5,0.42747509479522705
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5245662927627563
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5828911662101746
0,0,"um , having a look at the existing products , i found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there 's either um a very complicated one that 's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you do n't know what you 're doing . um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . um there 's an example i 'll show you at the end , um sh show you now . uh",15,0.5,0.4609638452529907
1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.6111522912979126

1,0,oop .,15,0.5,0.5296960473060608
0,0,"uh it looked a bit clunky . they 're very big and not very much use for buttons . um , and it 's just very hard to access the advanced functions . there 's there 's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . um , my own preferences , i prefer the the clunky one . um it 's very easy to use . um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which i i quite like having on the controls . um so i believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha from the bottom of it . so , now i 'd like to ask for your preferences . um not sure of how long we 've got , uh",15,0.5,0.4906556308269501
0,0,um . well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so i think at at most .,15,0.5,0.4554717540740967

1,0,just a couple of minutes anyway .,15,0.5,0.5233428478240967
1,0,"m yeah , like a lot of a lot of what i 've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what craig 's just gone over . so in part i could i could give you some of my personal preferences but i could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research .",15,0.5,0.5704877376556396

0,0,shall we sh well we 'll stick to kind of your area for now .,15,0.5,0.4697699248790741
1,0,um we might come to that later .,15,0.5,0.5167871117591858

1,0,"i see , so it 's more just basic .",15,0.5,0.6767907738685608
1,0,looks kind of yeah .,15,0.5,0.5716331005096436

1,0,"well i think it 's a valid point . i mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , and that p_r_t_ p p_r_o_t_ thing is incredibly confusing . um so i see i see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you do n't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , so maybe you know",15,0.5,0.5134369730949402

1,0,mm-hmm . uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.6552385687828064
1,0,um they 're just the the very basics you could use for a t_v_ .,15,0.5,0.5532389879226685
0,0,"uh-huh , and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4494968056678772
1,0,"okay . um , you say that 's a h a required one or a requested one ? would you like",15,0.5,0.6901925802230835

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6629267334938049

0,0,you know like brightness and contrast ?,15,0.5,0.46878764033317566
1,0,yeah . well i think i think es essentially what we 're doing right now is we 're categorising . we 're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ?,15,0.5,0.5765398740768433
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3275812864303589

1,0,"um , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6615769267082214
1,0,we 're kind of like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just do n't want the product to have ?,15,0.5,0.5997906923294067
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.6111409664154053
1,0,i think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ?,15,0.5,0.5805913805961609
1,0,"uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have",15,0.5,0.5044387578964233
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5171615481376648
1,0,um and after that we can add things if they 're possible .,15,0.5,0.5443045496940613
1,0,"okay , right . well , do you wan na maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this .",15,0.5,0.5709007978439331
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5477672815322876

0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.49108627438545227

1,0,right okay . um,15,0.5,0.5653641223907471
1,0,"well , one one way i would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it 's very clear what they want to do where they go .",15,0.5,0.614316463470459
0,0,mm-hmm yeah .,15,0.5,0.45214444398880005

0,0,oka,15,0.5,0.49783021211624146

0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.38629311323165894
1,0,"things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . and others that are uh also available",15,0.5,0.5709942579269409

1,0,"uh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section have i just lost oh no . um , uh do you think maybe that 's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . any of you anything to add to that at all ?",15,0.5,0.5435729026794434

1,0,"okay . alright . that would be okay . so um does that make sense ? so what i basically got is i just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 'cause certainly there 's lots of different information to go through . so um i 'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . um and then , as i say uh w we 'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um",15,0.5,0.6117949485778809

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.45748230814933777
1,0,"so this is what i 've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we 'll just read through together . um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . so they find them ugly . most people find them ugly . um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we 'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .",15,0.5,0.6878731846809387

1,0,"okay i 'm gon na we 'll look at that in a second . um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . so i guess what we 're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they do n't does n't really appeal to them .",15,0.5,0.644189715385437

0,0,if we can .,15,0.5,0.33730190992355347
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.553811252117157
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5722694993019104
1,0,"because um , based on what you 've go y everybody 's saying , right , you want something simple .",15,0.5,0.5942891240119934
0,0,okay . why is that ?,15,0.5,0.38238584995269775
1,0,you want basic stuff and you want something that 's easy to use . speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .,15,0.5,0.6574554443359375
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.302590548992157
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4473884105682373
1,0,could it be an on off thing ?,15,0.5,0.6884900331497192
0,0,"um ,",15,0.5,0.3872917592525482
1,0,like if you want it on,15,0.5,0.7143304347991943
0,0,"but what i 'm saying is that we 're we 're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology ,",15,0.5,0.41579118371009827
0,1,"well uh what comes up for me is that if we 're gon na if we 're gon na be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we 're not we 're gon na be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now .",15,0.5,0.46936848759651184
0,0,mm . mm . yep .,15,0.5,0.32963329553604126
1,0,"so that 's , from a marketing perspective i i see i see a lack .",15,0.5,0.6004810929298401
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3234625458717346
1,0,"and so we have to go , i think , in the other direction . what are we gon na have that makes this thing better than",15,0.5,0.5773549675941467
0,0,"well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that 's presented , i guess .",15,0.5,0.4512908160686493
0,0,"right . yeah . no , i i agree with you .",15,0.5,0.46181046962738037
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5062207579612732
0,0,"so what i 'm talking about is i see that one side we 're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gon na be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it does n't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta .",15,0.5,0.4935101270675659
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5175191164016724
1,0,so that 's that 's that was my reactions .,15,0.5,0.5810531377792358
1,0,yeah . but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television .,15,0.5,0.5050395727157593
1,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.5971465110778809
1,0,"so we 're quite fixed . so we 're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that 's uh that 's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product .",15,0.5,0.6464660167694092
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.3375202715396881
1,0,"yeah bu but we we 're designing only the remote ,",15,0.5,0.7023991942405701
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.44465172290802
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5685863494873047
1,0,we not design the t_v_ .,15,0.5,0.57994544506073
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.31583061814308167
1,0,so uh we 're gon na be removing the teletext out of any t_v_ that we people use our remote with .,15,0.5,0.6915680170059204
0,0,yeah . 'kay .,15,0.5,0.479809433221817
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4519975483417511
1,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.7147315740585327
1,0,so it 's kind of a stupid decision .,15,0.5,0.5226724147796631
1,0,i think we take with you .,15,0.5,0.5948591232299805
1,0,but there 's also the potential for mark there 's a market here for our lost teletext .,15,0.5,0.5256212949752808
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.504775881767273
0,0,"for example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . twenty-five euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here i guess .",15,0.5,0.41356179118156433
0,0,"that 's what i 'm that 's what i 'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gon na be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gon na be hap unhappy 'cause it took they ca n't ac access their teletext .",15,0.5,0.4888252019882202
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.223649263381958
1,0,okay . 'cause we 're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext .,15,0.5,0.6366493105888367
0,0,k yeah .,15,0.5,0.46295252442359924
1,0,"so so it 's it 's not that i 'm criticizing the product at all . it 's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? what are we bringing in to take the place of this ,",15,0.5,0.5373014211654663
1,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.5830078721046448
0,0,and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up .,15,0.5,0.4866011142730713
0,1,oh .,15,0.5,0.42832431197166443
1,0,du,15,0.5,0.6057789921760559
1,0,okay . thanks for coming to this meeting .,15,0.5,0.6307228207588196
0,0,hm .,15,0.5,0.4548206329345703
1,0,s how we doing on our remote ?,15,0.5,0.5596808791160583
1,0,we have some we have some ideas and some uh ideas for what people want .,15,0.5,0.515913188457489
1,0,uh we yes s i 've lo,15,0.5,0.5816957354545593
1,0,i 've done the role that i was asked to do anyway .,15,0.5,0.5158030390739441
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4993496239185333
1,0,i think .,15,0.5,0.596308171749115
1,0,"alright let 's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if i ca n't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . um i 'll go over what we went over last time , which should n't take long . then i believe each of you have a presentation . um i 've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it 's going to do it hopefully . and uh then we 'll have the closing . um which we 'll have forty minutes for . uh let 's see , the last meeting we went over um who was responsible for what . i 'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . um corinne is our marketing expert . she 's gon na figure out what what um the consumer wants . um ryan is our user interface designer . and manuel is the industrial designer . so you 're gon na come up with the ideas ryan , and you 're gon na pick 'em apart .",15,0.5,0.5329134464263916
1,0,"um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want . um we want to be modern , um fun , different . uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gon na have that locator function . um and we want to be different . um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . ball-shaped phone . the keyboard shape . um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . something we could use with one hand . um and that was our last meeting . so um why do n't um do each of you have a presentation ?",15,0.5,0.5825619697570801
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.37084850668907166
1,0,okay . i 'll hand it off to you and um does anyone do you wan na go first ?,15,0.5,0.5966985821723938
0,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.4683009386062622
1,0,so we can maybe see what uh what the people want .,15,0.5,0.7256881594657898
0,0,what was it ? function ?,15,0.5,0.3601444363594055
0,0,eight . f_ eight .,15,0.5,0.44686752557754517
0,0,f_ eight ? well . how do i get it,15,0.5,0.49775031208992004
1,0,slide show .,15,0.5,0.5463104844093323
0,0,to go to the next one ?,15,0.5,0.4780164659023285
1,0,oh right right right .,15,0.5,0.5498011708259583
1,0,yeah you click on that guy .,15,0.5,0.5379663705825806

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5848114490509033
1,0,"okay . alright . well , this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that i was sent . oh gosh , i 've no idea . g",15,0.5,0.5704370737075806
0,0,just press the arrow keys i think . usually goes to it .,15,0.5,0.45677047967910767
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5277540683746338
1,0,sorry i actually need to see something else on my screen .,15,0.5,0.5820010900497437
1,0,hit f_ eight again .,15,0.5,0.5107563138008118
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5801914930343628
1,0,i think .,15,0.5,0.5583081841468811
1,0,and then ? again ?,15,0.5,0.5375158190727234
1,0,"yeah . you want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ?",15,0.5,0.537278413772583
1,0,no i want something else on mine . is that possible ?,15,0.5,0.6161648631095886
0,0,yeah but i think you have to hit escape . and then you can yeah .,15,0.5,0.3840678334236145
1,0,okay but now you do n't have that .,15,0.5,0.575677752494812
1,0,oh hit f_ eight again .,15,0.5,0.5915061235427856
0,0,sorry guys .,15,0.5,0.438093364238739
1,0,i know . i did the same thing .,15,0.5,0.5653986930847168
0,0,and then it should come up here shortly . 'kay .,15,0.5,0.36035823822021484
1,0,so is there no way i can give you the slideshow and,15,0.5,0.5925740003585815
0,0,i think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ?,15,0.5,0.4903794825077057
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6280228495597839
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.44892534613609314
1,0,oh well .,15,0.5,0.581070601940155
0,0,i 'm not sure . you could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time i think .,15,0.5,0.40630677342414856
1,0,"yeah . it 's okay . okay . um so first of all , the method that i used was by doing some marketing research ,",15,0.5,0.6075606346130371
0,0,"by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . and then some internet research . and i was sent a report that was i think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . and so i will show you some of the results from that , which i think will be helpful . um okay here are some of the findings . they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . which is a fairly significant number i would say . and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . so i think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , i think that 's definitely important . um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . and if anyone could clarify what that means ?",15,0.5,0.498958557844162
0,0,just jus,15,0.5,0.37105080485343933
1,0,is is it j just just,15,0.5,0.5658360719680786
1,0,"zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ?",15,0.5,0.5271354913711548
1,0,just using it,15,0.5,0.5704725384712219
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5538889169692993
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5391470193862915
1,0,"okay . um and fifty percent of the users say that they 're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . and there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . and some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . of course channel selection is used the most frequently . and then teletext was the next . volume and then power . and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . so i think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so i think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . they said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r_s_i_ .",15,0.5,0.6575498580932617
0,0,a repetitive strain injury .,15,0.5,0.43158939480781555
1,0,what is it ?,15,0.5,0.576015293598175
0,0,just repetitive strain injury . i think . that 's what i guess .,15,0.5,0.4432026445865631
1,0,"okay . okay . and so bas okay . um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they 're all for it . from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . and it kind of just went down incrementally . the groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it 's worth investing in this . at least if we 're targeting the younger groups . and so in conclusion . some things that i drew from this are that i think we were correct . we definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . so you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that do n't seem to be serving much purpose . and then lastly i thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . and that 's it .",15,0.5,0.5855786800384521
1,0,"'kay . very nice . now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on . uh",15,0.5,0.5447098016738892
0,0,wait can i look at that real quick ? .,15,0.5,0.39022332429885864
1,0,oh yeah . sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ?,15,0.5,0.5247637033462524
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5844441056251526
1,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.6220733523368835
1,0,"having just listened to what corinne just said , i 'll draw on some of the things as well . some things that sort of relevant to what i wan na say . 'kay so i 'm just gon na yeah approach the technical functions design . um the method i used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control .",15,0.5,0.5234165787696838
1,0,"and t s simplest approach that i came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . i mean that 's an obvious thing to say , but it 's not attached to the device that you want to control . um i had some things sent to me . not very much . to look at similar devices . um defined in some them . and then the personal preferences that i will suggest . um we discussed a universal one . um like it 's just been brought up again then . but i think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you 'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . i 'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to i they 're a nightmare to use . you have to set them , reset them to everything . um and that would only add buttons . whereas i think the aim is to take away buttons . so i think it 'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for t_v_s . um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that 's unique in design . um okay here here 's just two pictures of remote controls . they 're just simple t_v_ remote controls . but one is uh user-centred . that is the one on the left . and you can straight away see there 's less buttons . and the other one is engineer-centred where that 's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it 's trying to control um which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred . fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what 's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they 're hidden away . and the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . um and finally , um uh sort i 've sort of covered that , our product i think should be user interface orientated . um like i said to concentrate on t_v_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . um and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it 's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . and that 's it .",15,0.5,0.6572598814964294
0,0,cable there . thank you .,15,0.5,0.39437705278396606
0,0,what was your last conclusion on that one ? focus on uh the i,15,0.5,0.4434465765953064
1,0,on something on the image of it .,15,0.5,0.6260004043579102
1,0,the image of it .,15,0.5,0.5864905118942261
1,0,uh the f the actual design .,15,0.5,0.5368806719779968
1,0,'kay . good . good .,15,0.5,0.6314685940742493
0,0,"okay . gon na talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . right . so unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it ,",15,0.5,0.4778437912464142
1,0,"so um i 'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . um just this is the basic basic premise of a remote control . um the basic function is to send messages to another system . okay so much is clear . an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . often in the form of infrared bits . this is the most mostly used . um there 's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . um parts are cheaper as well . a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . this is where my people screwed up basically .",15,0.5,0.5098723769187927
0,0,"so i 'm going to explain that on the board rather . um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . we 'll start with an energy source . right . um which is usually a battery right ? since it 's not feasible to add a cable to that . this energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself . uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . right ? this is the user interface and there we have the chip . um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . that sends out the signal . of course the signal differs accordingly . um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . and of course that 's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . the way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it 's working basically . you press something , you get a response . which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . now this , what we 're talking about here , or what i think should be discussed are these two components mostly . the the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . what we probably can not alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . we can not change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . right ? these two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . it c it does n't have to be there . this can be discussed as well . the user interface . that 's something we can also discuss . um as we 've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . speech recognition um interface , we do n't know that . or if we just do the usual button thing . or we have a touch pad or something like that that 's something we can discuss . and of course the energy source . batteries . solar cells . who knows ? of course it 's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough , developed enough . but that 's like i s i suppose rather up to marketing , and not to",15,0.5,0.48592013120651245
1,0,so we could the the,15,0.5,0.5737486481666565

1,0,"the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive",15,0.5,0.6310815215110779
0,0,expensive it 's gon na be get uh . yeah .,15,0.5,0.3037624955177307
1,0,but people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote .,15,0.5,0.7049517631530762
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.24451929330825806
1,0,so possibly it might be worth the investment .,15,0.5,0.6221553683280945
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.29479286074638367
1,0,i think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 'cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it 's on your phone .,15,0.5,0.6430715918540955
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4165723919868469
0,0,i agree . well,15,0.5,0.48941510915756226
1,0,and you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects i suppose as well .,15,0.5,0.5317721366882324
0,0,"i myself i find , when you , h when there 's something like spee speech recognition . like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end ,",15,0.5,0.48903653025627136
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3312419056892395
1,0,"and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . i find myself , especially if i 'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly .",15,0.5,0.6563061475753784
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.28426864743232727
1,0,"so maybe if you 're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then you know , you",15,0.5,0.5948787927627563
1,0,and wou i do n't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . if you were watching something would you sort of be wanting,15,0.5,0.5400856137275696
0,0,"volume up . volume down . change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ?",15,0.5,0.35315778851509094
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6291095614433289
0,0,i i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.41423285007476807
1,0,"another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they 'd do it , but probably a lot of them that 's actually their parents money . like i do n't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know .",15,0.5,0.6557429432868958
0,0,i think as well it 'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people .,15,0.5,0.39813232421875
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3764764070510864
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5817573666572571
1,0,but practically i do n't think it 's,15,0.5,0.6869605183601379
0,0,"it 's a , it 's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and",15,0.5,0.4561593532562256
0,0,yeah . it 'll wear off .,15,0.5,0.4717594385147095
1,0,gets old yeah .,15,0.5,0.5669074654579163
1,0,okay . um let 's see here .,15,0.5,0.6173129677772522
0,0,do you wan na put your cord back in ?,15,0.5,0.44995391368865967
1,0,yeah i guess so .,15,0.5,0.5655969977378845
1,0,oh right .,15,0.5,0.5495593547821045
1,0,trade you .,15,0.5,0.5283766984939575
0,0,go .,15,0.5,0.38915371894836426
1,0,"now i was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . um the remote 's only gon na be for the television , which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it 's more cost , more costly . and your re uh research showed that you know most of the people do n't even use it . i think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons .",15,0.5,0.6506029963493347
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.23629190027713776
1,0,"so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . um no teletext . um so we do n't have to worry about that . um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . and our corporate colours are grey and yellow . and we could probably get away with black too but so those are the three um the three new requirements that that i was told we need to use . um from all all three of your uh presentations , i think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . we want something that looks good . um we want something that 's simple . we want something that you can find easily . um and the speech recognition i i guess is kind of uh give or take . it 's gon na cost more . s the young the younger people say that they like it .",15,0.5,0.5975412726402283
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.40657877922058105
1,0,"but um it 's probably , i would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . so maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . um and that way we can focus on our form .",15,0.5,0.5842460989952087
0,0,"i did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wan na call it . um that you you should put it back in . your remote . but if you do n't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . just by infrared . that should n't be too complex i would 've thought .",15,0.5,0.47943297028541565
0,0,"that 'd be , that 'd be good if we were going with our our ball .",15,0.5,0.496185302734375
1,0,yeah it would be quite good .,15,0.5,0.5731484889984131
1,0,or or with you know i guess with any form that that would be good .,15,0.5,0.5802128314971924
1,0,the ball could sit on a,15,0.5,0.5038777589797974

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.44865182042121887
1,0,"we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . and that would be or solar . or you know however , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . um",15,0.5,0.6615993976593018
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4492020308971405
0,0,with the locator button . um and if it were the ball you 'd no longer have to have a flat space on it .,15,0.5,0.4515233337879181
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6194119453430176

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5551866888999939
1,0,that 's not an issue really .,15,0.5,0.6348319053649902
0,0,"um so i guess after the meeting we 'll have some questionnaires . and uh and some summaries for for what 's going on . um then we 'll take lunch . then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . um i 'll do the minutes . uh let 's see . it looks like you 're already on your way for uh working with the components . um chips , the what chips we need",15,0.5,0.49150514602661133

1,0,okay . you 're participant four .,15,0.5,0.5414193272590637

1,0,and then full screen .,15,0.5,0.5491858124732971
1,0,so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why do n't we pass right to the second slide . cause that 's where m my discussion starts . right well um since i 'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it .,15,0.5,0.5230734348297119
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.525411069393158
1,0,"um i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason i just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions . you know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your c_d_ whatever you want it to do",15,0.5,0.5366916060447693
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.48985281586647034
1,0,"um and then as we go on what we 'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility . so i 'll be coming to you um frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it 's gon na be to add a feature or how expensive it 's gon na be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it 's just something we ca n't do .",15,0.5,0.5681155920028687

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4060048758983612
1,0,"and then just weed things out that ca n't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we 'll try to then prioritise those .",15,0.5,0.7883174419403076
0,1,"okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting . again , i 'm gon na take minutes . oh , we 're gon na have a prototype presentation first .",15,0.5,0.40706855058670044

1,0,yeah . and then a second .,15,0.5,0.5708484053611755

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6516239643096924

0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.41509994864463806

0,0,the button .,15,0.5,0.43264779448509216

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.526945948600769
1,0,open uh .,15,0.5,0.5639154314994812
1,0,uh open .,15,0.5,0.5482548475265503
1,0,do you want to open,15,0.5,0.5388044118881226
1,0,because it 's open you mean .,15,0.5,0.5883416533470154
1,0,"right , so um i will talk about the the w working design and",15,0.5,0.5147300362586975
1,0,f_ five .,15,0.5,0.5410870909690857
1,0,"slide show , view slide show , .",15,0.5,0.5719204545021057
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.28394120931625366
1,0,and um well i i will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television .,15,0.5,0.6936419010162354
0,0,"so uh can you go one page down , please . so i think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do .",15,0.5,0.4666728079319
0,0,so uh mm i 'm thin uh i think uh i i 'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . then uh i will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like .,15,0.5,0.435197651386261
1,0,and how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that .,15,0.5,0.5488162040710449
0,0,"and when we are ready with this first prototype i i think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . okay so can you go down uh so , wha what i think for now is we do n't want to have a remote control w which is wired",15,0.5,0.38779085874557495
1,0,so uh i think we u we can use a battery for the . then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . and the communication with the t_v_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication so uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls,15,0.5,0.5347639918327332
0,0,did you draw it ?,15,0.5,0.427743524312973
0,0,wow .,15,0.5,0.35276496410369873
1,0,"so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the t_v_ set .",15,0.5,0.6537941694259644
0,0,this .,15,0.5,0.45124128460884094
1,0,this,15,0.5,0.5879495143890381
1,0,what is the other chip for ? the one on top .,15,0.5,0.5251469612121582
1,0,the one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities,15,0.5,0.6002936959266663
1,0,one is a communication .,15,0.5,0.6678577065467834
0,0,"and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the t_v_ set .",15,0.5,0.36726275086402893
1,0,for men . to the in okay .,15,0.5,0.6192376613616943
0,0,"and , that 's it . i think we should use a f_p_g_a_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t",15,0.5,0.4950028955936432
0,0,mm . what is f_p_g_a_ ?,15,0.5,0.3575989305973053
1,0,it 's field programmable uh something array .,15,0.5,0.5695168972015381
0,0,gateway arrays .,15,0.5,0.49310502409935
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6400670409202576
1,0,it 's a field programmable gateway arrays .,15,0.5,0.5454738736152649
1,0,so why 's it how is it different from the bluetooth ?,15,0.5,0.5964215397834778
0,0,"well , uh a f_p_g_a_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want .",15,0.5,0.42208021879196167
1,0,yeah . programme it .,15,0.5,0.6095231175422668
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5098816752433777
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5235158205032349
1,0,and uh well the bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices .,15,0.5,0.5628374814987183
0,0,yeah . uh so this are the they have to work together ? or ? do they have to work together or two separate choice,15,0.5,0.36433514952659607
1,0,"no . well , th the f_p_g_a_ will produce the the data to send .",15,0.5,0.5929969549179077
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4005981683731079
0,0,or it 's something like is n't hardware the first one ? and the second one is for the software .,15,0.5,0.48131608963012695
0,0,is the is the software par alri okay .,15,0.5,0.46960896253585815
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4600077271461487
1,0,yeah to run th to make it run .,15,0.5,0.5396875739097595
1,0,"okay , okay .",15,0.5,0.5498595237731934
1,0,that 's it .,15,0.5,0.533500611782074
0,0,"so you can control if you want , right ?",15,0.5,0.49971336126327515
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5803687572479248
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5972425937652588
1,0,alright and that 's it for the working design .,15,0.5,0.5044175982475281
1,0,so if you have any questions ?,15,0.5,0.6064295172691345
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.261057585477829
1,0,"okay , and how about the battery power ? uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?",15,0.5,0.6302949786186218
0,0,"uh no no no no , i think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the",15,0.5,0.4195297956466675
0,0,.,15,0.5,0.4490627944469452
1,0,into the,15,0.5,0.5739057064056396
0,0,yeah into the t .,15,0.5,0.3568703830242157
1,0,"more compact and uh okay ,",15,0.5,0.6086061596870422
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6037071347236633
1,0,"and uh i i do n't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so",15,0.5,0.5036321878433228
0,0,mm . mm .,15,0.5,0.35648268461227417
1,0,"yeah , yeah . okay .",15,0.5,0.6195980906486511

0,0,you can i yeah .,15,0.5,0.4781613349914551
1,0,"because you are using because you are using bluetooth , if some people have p_d_a_ they can use their p_d_a_ to control the t_v_ if they want to , right ?",15,0.5,0.6293938755989075
0,0,that 's a good idea .,15,0.5,0.4645664691925049

1,0,"and i was thinking about different types of designs and i came up with something . actually right here . so what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we 'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , i mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 'cause then it 'll appeal to older generation and like said retro 's cool . so it 's classically retro .",15,0.5,0.5988032221794128

0,0,"oh , maybe .",15,0.5,0.4347769021987915
1,0,"okay , so basically i 'm gon na present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control .",15,0.5,0.5478440523147583
0,0,"oh , you can put it here . oh that 's okay , it 's jus",15,0.5,0.3334612548351288
1,0,"um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they 'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they do n't like in remote controls . so basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users do n't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they 'd used in the past were ugly . completely ugly . um they they did n't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they 're watching t_v_ . um , that the layout of the remote controls did n't match they way that they used it . um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . and from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . um and you can see they 're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user 's watching t_v_ .",15,0.5,0.5922601819038391
0,0,"um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . and basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh were n't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well . so we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . and fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there 's many buttons and it 's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . um and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . we also asked some users about some specific features that they 'd like to see in the on the remote control . in particular , do they want an l_c_d_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control .",15,0.5,0.32918521761894226
1,0,"um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . they want these features , they want these high technology features .",15,0.5,0.5525307655334473
1,0,"um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . so i guess it depends on where we 're focusing our our market . um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um i think we 're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control .",15,0.5,0.5067794919013977
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.46544235944747925

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4845842123031616
1,0,"so , um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . so uh pet peter , can you talk say something about that ?",15,0.5,0.5735029578208923
1,0,"well , okay , yeah . yeah , but the user user interface is responsible .",15,0.5,0.6235937476158142

0,0,"you 're scaring me with l_c_d_ man . and speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .",15,0.5,0.35487112402915955
0,0,"yeah , it 's true , but , you know , they 're features that users want ,",15,0.5,0.48578909039497375
0,0,so it 's,15,0.5,0.3742124140262604

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5320321917533875
1,0,so i think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .,15,0.5,0.5778186321258545
1,0,at least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally .,15,0.5,0.5181633830070496

1,0,so we 're just estimating that yeah it would be less .,15,0.5,0.5814670324325562
1,0,so we 're writing down four . okay . how about these ? are we wanting them in,15,0.5,0.5550994873046875
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5262649059295654
1,0,no they 're just,15,0.5,0.571945071220398
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4836679995059967
1,0,is everything gon na be plastic ?,15,0.5,0.6915888786315918
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.36450332403182983
1,0,okay . so we 're w w quite far over .,15,0.5,0.6684576272964478
1,0,now we 're gon na something 's gon na have to go . um we 're at sixteen point eight and,15,0.5,0.6030675172805786
0,0,uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high-end product if,15,0.5,0.3747248351573944
1,0,"well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three euro ,",15,0.5,0.680229127407074
0,0,we only have very sparse,15,0.5,0.4747411608695984
0,0,"so let me see , what are we i mean",15,0.5,0.4710386097431183
1,0,two point three ? four point three no ?,15,0.5,0.6250776648521423
1,0,"oh yes sorry , four point three . my maths is all out .",15,0.5,0.546111524105072
0,0,"well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .",15,0.5,0.4252108931541443
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6153148412704468
1,0,how much would that save us ?,15,0.5,0.5571522116661072
1,0,and then where is the,15,0.5,0.5258155465126038
1,0,how much would that save us ?,15,0.5,0.5265564918518066
1,0,that will only save you one .,15,0.5,0.5251835584640503
1,0,that is one .,15,0.5,0.5710722804069519
0,0,"the other thing could be that um you could take away the l_c_d_ panel and the advanced chip together ,",15,0.5,0.4788650572299957
1,0,one .,15,0.5,0.6133814454078674
1,0,"um because when you do something on the t_v_ , the t_v_ responds and reacts as well ,",15,0.5,0.589357316493988
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.38250330090522766
1,0,so the user could be looking at the t_v_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to,15,0.5,0.6278562545776367
0,0,"that 's fair enough , yeah .",15,0.5,0.37169885635375977
1,0,"so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond ,",15,0.5,0.6161496043205261
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.405883252620697
1,0,which i think is a technically doable thing so,15,0.5,0.5560529232025146
0,0,okay so,15,0.5,0.4097076654434204
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.567040205001831
1,0,so w what 's our reviewed suggestion ?,15,0.5,0.5299769043922424
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5823639035224915
1,0,um take away the l_c_ display ?,15,0.5,0.5955662131309509
0,0,yep . and the advanced chip goes away as well .,15,0.5,0.4067820906639099
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6633896827697754
1,0,to be replaced with a,15,0.5,0.5734562277793884
0,0,regular chip .,15,0.5,0.47043901681900024
1,0,regular chip .,15,0.5,0.536152720451355
1,0,yep . so what that means is that um,15,0.5,0.5671221613883972
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5382444858551025
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5432877540588379
0,0,and so we 've got point three to get rid of . um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ?,15,0.5,0.3899153769016266
0,0,the twelve buttons that you see there .,15,0.5,0.42271482944488525
1,0,twelve buttons .,15,0.5,0.5236285328865051
0,0,that 's um one piece of rubber but it 's gon na have twelve button things underneath so,15,0.5,0.49508175253868103
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5029869675636292
1,0,functionally you 're gon na have to intercept so four is a good estimate for,15,0.5,0.5565638542175293
1,0,do you think ?,15,0.5,0.5076528787612915
0,0,"yeah , so you ca n't actually cut it 's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .",15,0.5,0.4388945400714874
0,0,"like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons ,",15,0.5,0.4753348231315613
0,0,"it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there 's actually one button underneath , it 's just that the panel itself is a single panel .",15,0.5,0.3777802884578705
1,0,how can it be something in between ?,15,0.5,0.56590735912323
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4629383683204651

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5531334280967712
1,0,well we have point three to get rid of somewhere .,15,0.5,0.5032748579978943
1,0,"we just report that it has to be over budget ,",15,0.5,0.5667425990104675
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4362788796424866
0,0,"or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .",15,0.5,0.39834368228912354
1,0,no can do .,15,0.5,0.6187382936477661
1,0,yeah we could just go with um,15,0.5,0.5872556567192078
1,0,yeah w,15,0.5,0.6007239818572998
0,0,normal coloured buttons .,15,0.5,0.47476255893707275
1,0,well do you want colour differentiation here ?,15,0.5,0.5585516095161438
0,0,no that 's not the button we 're talking about .,15,0.5,0.47417354583740234
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.5412136316299438
1,0,that 's,15,0.5,0.5062117576599121
1,0,oh yeah sorry yeah then .,15,0.5,0.5870636701583862
1,0,the buttons only refer to the pad so,15,0.5,0.5120272636413574
1,0,right so,15,0.5,0.5283517837524414
1,0,should we take that off uh ?,15,0.5,0.5416737198829651
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.3982786238193512
1,0,hey it 's back to the original .,15,0.5,0.6077385544776917
1,0,that 's it .,15,0.5,0.6015195250511169
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.43246588110923767
1,0,"um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost .",15,0.5,0.6263469457626343
0,0,mm-hmm . mm .,15,0.5,0.40897488594055176
1,0,"okay , ach that 's a shame . um right , so take away that completely ? ah . and now we 're under budget . so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted .",15,0.5,0.5885419249534607
1,0,so i reckon,15,0.5,0.523347020149231
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.42506352066993713
1,0,"how about with embossing the logo , is n't that going to cost us some money ?",15,0.5,0.5525318384170532
0,0,does n't say so .,15,0.5,0.4765291213989258
1,0,yeah . that 's a freebie .,15,0.5,0.5707279443740845
1,0,reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons .,15,0.5,0.5065007209777832
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5619933605194092
1,0,yeah that 's a good idea . just one ? does that mean that one button has a special form or,15,0.5,0.5460849404335022
0,0,i think there 's just one button so,15,0.5,0.3544817566871643
1,0,yeah okay .,15,0.5,0.5929341316223145
1,0,handy .,15,0.5,0.7249977588653564
1,0,"well well there we go . so i 'm just gon na have to redraw this now . so we 're not gon na have the l_c_d_ anymore , and we 'll just gon na have an on t on the t_v_ it 'll show you what you 're doing , which i think is fair enough , and so this is gon na be one big thing here . um .",15,0.5,0.5493204593658447
0,0,was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ?,15,0.5,0.4226350784301758
1,0,what do you mean by profile ?,15,0.5,0.6139577627182007
1,0,sort of flat as possible .,15,0.5,0.5264335870742798
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.635699987411499
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5574352741241455
0,0,you see i envision it as being um quite deep,15,0.5,0.49842438101768494
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6714593172073364
1,1,"i was still uh i was still working on this uh twenty five euro price point because i think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price if if we 're maybe i can get to this in my presentation though ,",15,0.5,0.5238240361213684
0,0,yeah yeah . sure sure .,15,0.5,0.4648042619228363
1,0,but um yeah .,15,0.5,0.6644557118415833
1,0,"so maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now .",15,0.5,0.5286465287208557
0,0,yep . okay .,15,0.5,0.47379952669143677
1,0,okay so let 's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about l_c_d_ and speech uh reco,15,0.5,0.5150656700134277
1,0,yeah . i think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you 're watching t_v_ you 're gon na have a lot of this uh background noise from the t_v_ which might interfere with the,15,0.5,0.6332316398620605
0,0,"sorry , what is your ?",15,0.5,0.4915676712989807
1,0,"uh participant three . you might have some background noise from the t_v_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so .",15,0.5,0.5394837260246277
1,0,"yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so yeah yeah .",15,0.5,0.5187583565711975
1,0,"oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the t_v_ the t_v_ sound turns off .",15,0.5,0.5003654360771179
0,0,yeah uh channel fifty .,15,0.5,0.38108038902282715
1,0,no it could be command control kind of thing .,15,0.5,0.6946679353713989
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3221053183078766
1,0,"it requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition .",15,0.5,0.6336112022399902
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4184224307537079
1,0,because this kind of thing means speech is there from the t_v_ also .,15,0.5,0.6097869277000427
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.39613720774650574
1,0,"so there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop .",15,0.5,0.5753875970840454
1,0,mm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5091918706893921
1,0,"it 's like v_i_ editor , you are having two modes similarly .",15,0.5,0.5700035691261292
0,0,otherwise it 's just lying idle .,15,0.5,0.4914305806159973
0,0,okay michael .,15,0.5,0.4625193476676941
1,0,"okay , so , could i describe the mouse maybe be easier to",15,0.5,0.5386134386062622
1,0,sorry ?,15,0.5,0.5399976968765259
1,0,"could i use the mouse , or",15,0.5,0.5442749261856079
1,0,um yeah .,15,0.5,0.6916298270225525
1,0,mm . thanks . okay .,15,0.5,0.6507036089897156
0,0,the wheel does n't work .,15,0.5,0.4046528935432434
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.37658825516700745
1,0,"okay so um while uh researching this this topic i first of all just thought of a couple of things that i would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they 're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . so um there 's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it 's not really it 's by no means uh mm you know on it 's own in being so expensive . there are a lot of expensive remote controls out there .",15,0.5,0.7289761304855347
0,0,looks like a p_d_a_ ?,15,0.5,0.4265846014022827
1,0,"so yeah it doe it 's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the l_c_d_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , i know we 're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these l_c_d_ screens which kind of helps when you 're using multiple uh devices i suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times . but um the thing that i find most interesting about this remote control , and it 's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , which i think is it 's a really kind of important design aspect um is it 's 'cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . and obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel .",15,0.5,0.6003172993659973
0,0,change the channels .,15,0.5,0.41249608993530273
0,0,now um,15,0.5,0.4896728992462158
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6238572001457214
1,0,uh the i think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'cause i know when i um when i use the remote to change the channel i very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . i usually use the up and down,15,0.5,0.5692157745361328
1,0,mmm-hmm mm-hmm . yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.6600319743156433
1,0,"because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that 's just uh it 's annoying . so i think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an l_c_d_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability .",15,0.5,0.5274648070335388
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5284822583198547
1,0,"one possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff ca n't be done for twenty five eu uh euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the l_c_d_ screen so that instead of actually saying i want to i want to go to channel thirty seven because i know this programme 's on , you know , often you do n't know what ch what channel it 's on , or you do n't know what 's on . if you have a list of of programs on your l_c_d_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . so if you think about it 's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you do n't use you do n't remember people 's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it .",15,0.5,0.5102972984313965
1,0,"so this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price . so , i mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it 's it 's it 's very simple , there 's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . so this is something else we might wan na consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on epinions . it it 's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really i think people want to be able to find the button they 're looking for without even looking at the remote control . and was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but i think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . so if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want .",15,0.5,0.5437448024749756
0,0,but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality .,15,0.5,0.4887961447238922

0,0,yeah well we w,15,0.5,0.46055230498313904
0,0,because the same button is doing too many things .,15,0.5,0.4995208978652954
0,0,"yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we 're only doing uh a television remote control . um i think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . um",15,0.5,0.4475116729736328

0,0,"they do n't really do anything . maybe you know i although i do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good .",15,0.5,0.47769972681999207
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5642381310462952
0,0,"um but i think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . um",15,0.5,0.373075932264328
1,0,h i think i think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control should n't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it 's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional,15,0.5,0.7035332322120667

1,0,"so i 'll be coming to you for how much is it gon na cost us and how long is it gon na take you ,",15,0.5,0.5392909646034241
0,0,mm mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.29326626658439636
1,0,"and i 'll be coming to you to tell me what 's gon na make somebody take out their wallet you know ,",15,0.5,0.677354633808136
0,0,what features .,15,0.5,0.32465600967407227
1,0,"what what 's what 's gon na really be what they call a sizzle ,",15,0.5,0.5823485851287842
1,0,s sellable . yes .,15,0.5,0.5100703835487366
0,0,'cause we got ta sell this sizzle .,15,0.5,0.48808616399765015
1,0,a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is n't the thing that somebody 's really just gon na take out their wallet and buy for christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever .,15,0.5,0.6686843037605286
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.34880557656288147
1,0,okay can we go to the next slide please ? alright i i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we 're looking at the uh the whole house idea really is n't gon na be possible . so i 'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we we could suggest anything .,15,0.5,0.5824258923530579
1,0,"i 'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we 'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what 'll be and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we 're looking at and at the price point we 're looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v_ , the v_c_r_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .",15,0.5,0.5027891397476196
1,0,"uh okay , can can i at this point interject um something ?",15,0.5,0.5310331583023071
1,0,"i have to wind up ? yeah , sure .",15,0.5,0.5309844017028809
0,0,"um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered . um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that 's the teletext ,",15,0.5,0.4211035370826721
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5616236329078674
1,0,"because that 's sort of outdated with the internet ,",15,0.5,0.5358877182006836
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5258466005325317
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.511736273765564
1,0,"and according to to higher management the it should only control the t_v_ ,",15,0.5,0.6836709380149841
0,0,"mostly because they feel that it 's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things ,",15,0.5,0.33471938967704773
1,0,"complicated , yeah , of course .",15,0.5,0.5052440762519836
0,0,and they are concerned with the time to market .,15,0.5,0.4706190824508667
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4864666759967804
1,0,"of course , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5863220691680908
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4045482873916626
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6058633327484131
0,0,um and the,15,0.5,0.4576033651828766
1,0,"okay , so that 's something",15,0.5,0.6532584428787231
0,0,"and the third thing that they wan na make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it 's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there 's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out .",15,0.5,0.4796435534954071
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5299232006072998
1,0,"so i just wanted to interject this here so we 're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wan na look at . these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things , so it 's only gon na be t_v_ ,",15,0.5,0.5314468145370483
0,0,okay so,15,0.5,0.3789603114128113
1,0,but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea .,15,0.5,0.5166196227073669
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5462979078292847
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.3530670702457428
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4991568326950073
1,0,"alright , thanks for that . um alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it 's lost somewhere in the room . um so those are two things that we definitely do wan na address , uh we wan na s make it as simple as possible , we wan na make it um obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , and i think that those are things after my research that we definitely wan na try to incorporate . 'kay can we go to the next slide please ? okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that 's gon na make it an impulse purchase . uh because once there 's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs do n't come back .",15,0.5,0.5671187043190002
0,0,"if somebody says , oh i 'll come back and get it next week you 're dead . they 're never gon na come back and buy it . you 've got ta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . and , in order to make it really sellable we 've got ta shorten the learning curve , make sure it 's really intuitive and easy to use . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that 's why i 'm saying , simplicity is good . finding it 's important , obviously you ca n't use it if you ca n't find it . so we 've got ta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and i 've already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five euros i 'm not gon na take that . has to be so great that they 're gon na say , uh twenty five euros is n't much . um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign .",15,0.5,0.45340120792388916
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3846452534198761
1,0,okay that 's uh about it for me right now .,15,0.5,0.5107678771018982
1,0,"okay . and uh who would be next , uh , i guess that would be you . mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.5167051553726196

1,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5612520575523376
1,0,uh can you make it uh full screen please ?,15,0.5,0.5872030854225159
1,0,mm-hmm . yep .,15,0.5,0.5085952877998352
1,0,"no , it 's like a well you you have to press here . the cup cup shape here ?",15,0.5,0.6334155201911926
1,0,"yeah yeah , uh-huh .",15,0.5,0.6395639777183533
1,0,the thir third .,15,0.5,0.557287871837616
1,0,"there , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.521327793598175
0,0,yeah exactly . uh so today i 'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . um can you go to the next sli slide please ?,15,0.5,0.48235663771629333
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5154771208763123
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.41455987095832825
1,0,the metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . it should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th,15,0.5,0.6567821502685547
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.36489003896713257
1,0,"this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it 's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . it should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal ,",15,0.5,0.5949202179908752
1,0,signal .,15,0.5,0.5483161807060242
1,0,"and the t_v_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control",15,0.5,0.6772818565368652
0,0,receive .,15,0.5,0.48494815826416016
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5528656840324402
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4794468879699707
1,0,and uh so uh i think it 's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices .,15,0.5,0.5956438183784485
0,0,multi-purpose .,15,0.5,0.483704537153244
1,0,yo and it 's,15,0.5,0.5163116455078125
0,0,"yeah well that 's already been eliminated by management , so we 're off the hook .",15,0.5,0.4774586260318756
0,0,yeah but it 's so .,15,0.5,0.49579668045043945
1,0,uh yeah .,15,0.5,0.6448837518692017
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4459677040576935
1,0,"um . so uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . so uh you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh t_v_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there 's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t_v_ can perform the actions .",15,0.5,0.6220642924308777
0,0,mm okay .,15,0.5,0.40753060579299927
1,0,so can you go to the next slide please ?,15,0.5,0.5084859132766724
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.43808895349502563
1,0,"so i i just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um i think these are the very simple features and uh they do n't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also ,",15,0.5,0.6280022859573364
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.37663084268569946
1,0,it 's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they 'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark .,15,0.5,0.5209556818008423
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4197310209274292
0,0,"and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it 's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . and there should be a child lock , like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they ca n't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they 'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it 's a it 's hard but i think it 's possible",15,0.5,0.4874083697795868
1,0,"yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that 's that 's unfortunately a moot point now . mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.5397042632102966
1,0,but it uh,15,0.5,0.5093136429786682
0,0,well we already eliminated that .,15,0.5,0.4889790117740631

0,0,it 's pretty abstract .,15,0.5,0.4251120090484619
1,0,"uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half euro . so uh from my point of view , i do n't think it 's uh gon na be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half euro .",15,0.5,0.5783132314682007
0,0,uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million euro . so that 's a lot . we have to sell uh a lot of uh,15,0.5,0.4680471122264862
0,0,"yeah , how much is it ?",15,0.5,0.3771165609359741

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5041832327842712
1,0,"um so now it 's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . you can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . what you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . what uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . um so uh let 's uh let 's uh discuss a little . i 'm gon na join you at the table . well what what 's the most uh important thing at a remote control ?",15,0.5,0.5568232536315918
0,0,um well i think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . uh,15,0.5,0.4585645794868469
0,0,okay . so not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a d_v_d_ and radio and or just only,15,0.5,0.4642462134361267
1,0,yeah . i think so . uh but i have some points . can i show them on the on the big screen ? maybe ?,15,0.5,0.5723757147789001

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6358510851860046
1,0,"um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . uh it 's pretty cheap , twenty five euros . uh brand independent . um i think , it does n't have to matter uh which brand your t_v_ or other thing is . um",15,0.5,0.5968499779701233
1,0,yeah . okay . five minutes .,15,0.5,0.5670952200889587

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.46556925773620605
1,0,uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose .,15,0.5,0.6040064096450806
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3693026602268219
1,0,"and uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products .",15,0.5,0.6203197240829468
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4632406532764435
0,0,"um maybe some other technology than infrared . uh i rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the t_v_ then you ca n't switch it . um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .",15,0.5,0.4857582747936249
1,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5275507569313049
0,0,that might be a little bit uh expensive . um and something like an l_c_d_ screen .,15,0.5,0.4047777056694031
1,0,for what purpose ?,15,0.5,0.6942867636680603
0,0,"um uh like i said here um maybe it 's easy . it 's nice as an added feature feature , that um , when you 're on a certain channel , you can see on the l_c_d_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or",15,0.5,0.3959660828113556
1,0,okay . so it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh,15,0.5,0.5501230359077454
1,0,"from my point of view , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5616945028305054
1,0,"remote ? yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ?",15,0.5,0.5653896927833557

1,0,we,15,0.5,0.5565469264984131
0,0,so i i i i,15,0.5,0.4992048442363739
1,0,so we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to,15,0.5,0.5491228699684143
1,0,to the current market .,15,0.5,0.5066836476325989
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.49033212661743164
1,0,"look , you got some cheap uh remote controls there . they just uh yeah , you got a dozen of 'em .",15,0.5,0.6629339456558228
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.24298086762428284
1,0,but when you enter a new market with a remote control and,15,0.5,0.6526209712028503
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.34693247079849243

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5481092929840088
1,0,"you have to do something special , i think .",15,0.5,0.6083109378814697
0,0,"yeah . but we have to keep an eye that it 's uh at the beginning of such a project , it 's it 's it 's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool .",15,0.5,0.49450862407684326
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5319758653640747
1,0,uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh,15,0.5,0.523886501789093
1,0,"yeah , of course .",15,0.5,0.7031550407409668
0,0,and and the price .,15,0.5,0.4188389778137207
0,1,"okay , i also have a f very simple presentation ,",15,0.5,0.4442509710788727
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.43261128664016724
1,0,because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want .,15,0.5,0.6227898597717285
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4202253818511963
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.59416663646698
1,0,"i also have uh copied a different type of remote . if you can find me , where i 'm at . there should only be one in here . trend watch .",15,0.5,0.5558345317840576
0,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.48301950097084045
0,0,it 's being modified .,15,0.5,0.46905502676963806
1,0,"they 're stealing our product . we 've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause uh trends change very very quickly . in six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it 's gon na be a question how fast we can act . uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh .",15,0.5,0.5987709164619446
0,0,"no ,",15,0.5,0.4453040063381195

1,0,f go to findings .,15,0.5,0.5661931037902832
0,0,"no no , no no . 'cause i had another comment there . uh the market trend . this is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we 've done , fancy and feel-good , that 's what we 've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that 's easy to use . looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they 're all very similar , they all do the same thing ,",15,0.5,0.453199177980423
0,0,"we have to have something completely different . okay ? easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it 's a remote that 's easy to use . and i think this is another thing that 's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . so even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . the second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . the second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use .",15,0.5,0.3881070613861084
1,0,"the first one , i see that they put in a display . now there 's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we 're adding all kinds of things in ,",15,0.5,0.5023738145828247
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4785424470901489
1,0,"but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked .",15,0.5,0.5453366637229919
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5763235092163086
0,0,"maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you 're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display",15,0.5,0.42898523807525635

0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.4743415117263794
0,0,"okay because i 've seen mostly the standard ones ,",15,0.5,0.41816121339797974
1,0,especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and,15,0.5,0.5806384682655334
0,0,"yeah . now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . the idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you 're doing .",15,0.5,0.4195552170276642
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.596048891544342

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6138409376144409
1,0,"you know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball ,",15,0.5,0.5484433174133301
1,0,", we might 've",15,0.5,0.5270329713821411
1,0,oh yeah .,15,0.5,0.6131575703620911
0,0,"and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .",15,0.5,0.4854002892971039
1,0,"yeah , so it 's really molded to to your specific",15,0.5,0.6519351005554199
0,0,to t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh,15,0.5,0.4307553172111511
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.561606764793396
1,0,how hard they squeeze ?,15,0.5,0.6927014589309692
0,0,yes you 'd know what kind of wood to get .,15,0.5,0.4608059823513031
0,0,"resistance resistance , right .",15,0.5,0.3817279636859894
1,0,but th for that you 'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote .,15,0.5,0.5848705172538757
0,0,"that 's right , that 's right , you would n't wan na go too far down that . oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4878354072570801
1,0,"the sales , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5998127460479736
1,0,the yeah . i hope so .,15,0.5,0.5898644328117371

1,0,"well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick .",15,0.5,0.5229063630104065

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5527769923210144
1,0,here we go again . welcome . uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support .,15,0.5,0.6046191453933716
0,0,thi,15,0.5,0.4200248122215271

0,0,me first again or,15,0.5,0.49247676134109497
1,0,yeah sure . does n't matter .,15,0.5,0.5600196719169617
0,0,oh . no . yeah . no problem,15,0.5,0.4429902136325836
1,0,yeah . alright . did you open it already or,15,0.5,0.6222894787788391
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5113927721977234
0,0,"no . ah . ah . yes . so welcome to the marketing presentation once again . um this time about trendwatching . uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . uh it shows a number of developments . uh i will address them uh in a moment . um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that 's our public . um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . and the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . so um the developments i will address them",15,0.5,0.47352302074432373
1,0,"oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . so to give you an idea . um well the developments ? uh development one . uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . and the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . i think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition ,",15,0.5,0.5449029207229614
1,0,sound . yeah yeah uh uh .,15,0.5,0.5345540642738342
1,0,"so i do n't expect that to be a problem . and the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . um well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect , w which was twice as important as the third aspect .",15,0.5,0.5478049516677856
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4593076705932617
1,0,so um that kind of gets you this ratios . so fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention .,15,0.5,0.5413388609886169
1,0,.,15,0.5,0.5621743202209473
0,0,"uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . um well technolog technological innovation , we 've covered that pretty much i guess . um and easy to use , i do n't think that will be problem . so my point of attention is especially this part .",15,0.5,0.45603907108306885
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6414211988449097
1,0,that this will be a crux . so that was the marketing uh presentation . i had only one document left .,15,0.5,0.5220677256584167
1,0,and shall i go first ?,15,0.5,0.5387516617774963
1,0,yeah . no . i i do n't mi i do n't mind .,15,0.5,0.5925435423851013
1,0,so i,15,0.5,0.5606816411018372
1,0,that 's,15,0.5,0.5020745992660522
1,0,yeah yeah sure . no .,15,0.5,0.6404569745063782
1,0,so kind of this,15,0.5,0.5437463521957397
1,0,do you want to go first ? okay .,15,0.5,0.5248987078666687
1,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.5416716933250427

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7546983361244202
1,0,kind of this this look .,15,0.5,0.5001095533370972
0,0,"uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours",15,0.5,0.3425084352493286
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.640796422958374
1,0,i dunno . just made a quick design .,15,0.5,0.6149250268936157
1,0,cool . yeah you 're just the user interface hmm ?,15,0.5,0.6245771646499634
1,0,it 's better than than my uh drawing .,15,0.5,0.5348337888717651
0,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.4645216166973114
1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.5141050815582275
1,0,yeah okay but i have to design the,15,0.5,0.5257899165153503
1,0,uh components .,15,0.5,0.5160151124000549
0,0,yeah layout .,15,0.5,0.40786054730415344
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5607153177261353
1,0,yeah okay .,15,0.5,0.5984525084495544
1,0,oh no .,15,0.5,0.5221383571624756
1,0,yeah . it 's okay .,15,0.5,0.5793362259864807
1,0,you probably opened it .,15,0.5,0.6167049407958984
1,0,yeah true . um,15,0.5,0.5146252512931824
1,0,f_ five .,15,0.5,0.5536327362060547
1,0,f_ five .,15,0.5,0.527287483215332
1,0,alright . so,15,0.5,0.5599387288093567
1,0,"i 'm dealing with the components design . um let 's see . i uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . and i used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . that 's why i had to , wanted to go first . well they gave me um an idea about what people want . we 're f mainly focusing on this group , but i want to make the distinction clear . uh i could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so i do n't have examples of how it looks like . but it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . if you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . so this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . there is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components .",15,0.5,0.5041707158088684
0,0,"there 's a lot of options that we have to discuss . uh for example the energy source . we have four types . the basic battery . uh we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt .",15,0.5,0.49949780106544495
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4815407991409302
1,0,"uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it .",15,0.5,0.6090338826179504
0,0,"which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wan na use the",15,0.5,0.4477010667324066
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5569232702255249
1,0,and uh of course solar cells . but i dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product .,15,0.5,0.539749264717102
0,0,wi an indoors .,15,0.5,0.46090078353881836
0,0,so uh my,15,0.5,0.4042740762233734
1,0,yeah okay .,15,0.5,0.5435431003570557
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.4600697457790375
0,0,calculator 's can do it .,15,0.5,0.4219307601451874
1,0,"yeah also also in you know countries where there 's n is n't much light like in scandinavia , they would n't be y able to use it half of the year you know .",15,0.5,0.5746880173683167
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5431006550788879
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6102137565612793
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5740957856178284
0,0,"so that 's not cool either . so um for the uh a case , there 's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . or the double curved . um i was n't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it 's daring and different from what we have now . uh the case materials .",15,0.5,0.4562109410762787
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5605303049087524
1,0,"well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . i would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wan na see nowadays .",15,0.5,0.5706303119659424
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5308623313903809
1,0,"um poo , this is a lot of text . i was n't able to organise this yet . we have yeah several uh interface designs . uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons .",15,0.5,0.5265148282051086
1,0,yeah . pushbuttons . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5176220536231995
0,0,so that 's not really interesting .,15,0.5,0.4734712839126587
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5871604084968567
1,0,"electronics ? yeah , maybe we wan na decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip i think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . um yeah . i think this is about it . yeah i was working on some per personal preferences . i first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah i 'm traditional and that 's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . but i really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy ,",15,0.5,0.5369720458984375
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5027050971984863
1,0,where you have to move the thing to be able to use it .,15,0.5,0.6284430027008057
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.42532792687416077
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5436242818832397

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.45453742146492004
1,0,or combine uh both with a with one uh,15,0.5,0.5574002265930176
1,0,uh i think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the,15,0.5,0.5534499883651733
0,0,yeah maybe we,15,0.5,0.4648836553096771
0,0,i guess we can only choose one .,15,0.5,0.46416231989860535
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5188072323799133
1,0,"i can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . but it is more longlasting , that the people do n't have to ever buy batteries again .",15,0.5,0.5663089156150818
0,0,yeah,15,0.5,0.45730116963386536
1,0,yeah . and it 's more fun .,15,0.5,0.6069038510322571
0,0,i did n't receive any info uh .,15,0.5,0.47847387194633484
1,0,"and it 's also more fun yeah . i always chuck my uh remote control around , so",15,0.5,0.6071118712425232

0,0,yeah advanced chip .,15,0.5,0.4285156726837158
1,0,um what about the electronics here ?,15,0.5,0.7350475192070007
0,0,"we need an advanced chip i think , yep .",15,0.5,0.4709447920322418
1,0,advanced chip .,15,0.5,0.5664600729942322
1,0,let me just confirm that . yes i think so . yep .,15,0.5,0.5760179758071899
1,0,"okay um the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ?",15,0.5,0.5437211990356445
0,0,um i think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing .,15,0.5,0.4841446578502655
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6398829221725464
1,0,so we want double-curved ?,15,0.5,0.6020194888114929
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.41884908080101013

1,0,plastic .,15,0.5,0.698557436466217
1,0,is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any,15,0.5,0.5462315678596497
0,0,i think we 're gon na have to skip the rubber .,15,0.5,0.38003069162368774
1,0,"okay ,",15,0.5,0.516343891620636

1,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.5208424925804138
1,0,so i 'll have to put that oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there ?,15,0.5,0.6052091717720032
0,0,"for the case itself , one colour . it 's one special colour .",15,0.5,0.48573362827301025
1,0,"just one colour , okay .",15,0.5,0.5217201113700867
1,0,"'cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it .",15,0.5,0.5388892292976379
1,0,"okay so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ?",15,0.5,0.5297992825508118
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.38224563002586365
1,0,yes . one and the l_c_ display .,15,0.5,0.5567331314086914
0,0,"okay and then buttons , we have what , two colours ?",15,0.5,0.43428999185562134
1,0,how many,15,0.5,0.6283345818519592
0,0,um we have um got some push buttons as well .,15,0.5,0.40788331627845764
1,0,or even clear .,15,0.5,0.5677226781845093
0,0,we 've got push buttons as well .,15,0.5,0.486438125371933
0,0,like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push,15,0.5,0.45397648215293884
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.42391079664230347
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6238492131233215
0,0,so i reckon we 've got one button for this thing 'cause it 's just one big sheet of rubber .,15,0.5,0.45978379249572754
0,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.4749743640422821
1,0,i 'm not sure if that counts but,15,0.5,0.5325153470039368
0,0,okay let 's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .,15,0.5,0.32419344782829285
1,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5879747867584229
0,0,"okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again .",15,0.5,0.4436536729335785
1,0,four .,15,0.5,0.5957434773445129
1,0,you can see we 're we 're all very far beyond the,15,0.5,0.502395510673523
1,0,so w why are we arriving at the number four ? where does the number four come from ?,15,0.5,0.5805666446685791
0,0,'cause that 's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons .,15,0.5,0.3449022173881531
1,0,"okay right ,",15,0.5,0.5399816632270813
1,0,so we 're just estimating that yeah it would be less .,15,0.5,0.5814670324325562
1,0,so we 're writing down four . okay . how about these ? are we wanting them in,15,0.5,0.5550994873046875
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5262649059295654
1,0,no they 're just,15,0.5,0.571945071220398
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4836679995059967
1,0,is everything gon na be plastic ?,15,0.5,0.6915888786315918
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.36450332403182983
1,0,okay . so we 're w w quite far over .,15,0.5,0.6684576272964478
1,0,now we 're gon na something 's gon na have to go . um we 're at sixteen point eight and,15,0.5,0.6030674576759338
0,0,uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high-end product if,15,0.5,0.3747248351573944
1,0,"well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three euro ,",15,0.5,0.680229127407074
0,0,we only have very sparse,15,0.5,0.47474122047424316
0,0,"so let me see , what are we i mean",15,0.5,0.4710386097431183
1,0,two point three ? four point three no ?,15,0.5,0.6252121925354004
1,0,"oh yes sorry , four point three . my maths is all out .",15,0.5,0.546007513999939
0,0,"well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .",15,0.5,0.4252694845199585
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6153148412704468
1,0,how much would that save us ?,15,0.5,0.5571522116661072
1,0,and then where is the,15,0.5,0.5258155465126038
1,0,how much would that save us ?,15,0.5,0.5265564918518066
1,0,that will only save you one .,15,0.5,0.5251835584640503
1,0,that is one .,15,0.5,0.571071445941925
0,0,"the other thing could be that um you could take away the l_c_d_ panel and the advanced chip together ,",15,0.5,0.47886568307876587
1,0,one .,15,0.5,0.6133804321289062
1,0,"um because when you do something on the t_v_ , the t_v_ responds and reacts as well ,",15,0.5,0.589357316493988
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3825031816959381
1,0,so the user could be looking at the t_v_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to,15,0.5,0.6278562545776367
0,0,"that 's fair enough , yeah .",15,0.5,0.371698796749115
1,0,"so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond ,",15,0.5,0.6161496043205261
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4058830738067627
1,0,which i think is a technically doable thing so,15,0.5,0.556053102016449
0,0,okay so,15,0.5,0.40970751643180847
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.567040205001831
1,0,so w what 's our reviewed suggestion ?,15,0.5,0.5299769043922424
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5823639035224915
1,0,um take away the l_c_ display ?,15,0.5,0.5955662131309509
0,0,yep . and the advanced chip goes away as well .,15,0.5,0.4067820906639099
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6633896827697754
1,0,to be replaced with a,15,0.5,0.5734562277793884
0,0,regular chip .,15,0.5,0.47043901681900024
1,0,regular chip .,15,0.5,0.536152720451355
1,0,yep . so what that means is that um,15,0.5,0.5671221613883972
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5382444858551025
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5432877540588379
0,0,and so we 've got point three to get rid of . um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ?,15,0.5,0.3948577642440796
0,0,the twelve buttons that you see there .,15,0.5,0.3910035192966461
1,0,twelve buttons .,15,0.5,0.5236285924911499
0,0,that 's um one piece of rubber but it 's gon na have twelve button things underneath so,15,0.5,0.49508175253868103
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5029869675636292
1,0,functionally you 're gon na have to intercept so four is a good estimate for,15,0.5,0.5565638542175293
1,0,do you think ?,15,0.5,0.5076528787612915
0,0,"yeah , so you ca n't actually cut it 's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .",15,0.5,0.43889468908309937
0,0,"like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons ,",15,0.5,0.4753345549106598
0,0,"it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there 's actually one button underneath , it 's just that the panel itself is a single panel .",15,0.5,0.377780556678772
1,0,how can it be something in between ?,15,0.5,0.56590735912323
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4629383683204651
0,0,mm . okay,15,0.5,0.4624078869819641
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5531334280967712
1,0,well we have point three to get rid of somewhere .,15,0.5,0.5032748579978943
1,0,"we just report that it has to be over budget ,",15,0.5,0.5667425990104675
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4362788796424866
0,0,"or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .",15,0.5,0.39834368228912354
1,0,no can do .,15,0.5,0.6187382936477661
1,0,yeah we could just go with um,15,0.5,0.5872556567192078
1,0,yeah w,15,0.5,0.6007239818572998
0,0,normal coloured buttons .,15,0.5,0.47476255893707275
1,0,well do you want colour differentiation here ?,15,0.5,0.5585516095161438
0,0,no that 's not the button we 're talking about .,15,0.5,0.47417354583740234
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.5412136316299438
1,0,that 's,15,0.5,0.5062117576599121
1,0,oh yeah sorry yeah then .,15,0.5,0.5870636701583862
1,0,the buttons only refer to the pad so,15,0.5,0.5120272636413574
1,0,right so,15,0.5,0.5283517837524414
1,0,should we take that off uh ?,15,0.5,0.5416737198829651
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.3982786238193512
1,0,hey it 's back to the original .,15,0.5,0.6077385544776917
1,0,that 's it .,15,0.5,0.6015195250511169
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4325043559074402
1,0,"um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost .",15,0.5,0.6263272762298584
0,0,mm-hmm . mm .,15,0.5,0.4089943766593933
1,0,"okay , ach that 's a shame . um right , so take away that completely ? ah . and now we 're under budget . so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted .",15,0.5,0.5885419249534607
1,0,so i reckon,15,0.5,0.523347020149231
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.42506352066993713
1,0,"how about with embossing the logo , is n't that going to cost us some money ?",15,0.5,0.5525318384170532
0,0,does n't say so .,15,0.5,0.4765291213989258
1,0,yeah . that 's a freebie .,15,0.5,0.5707280039787292
0,0,reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons .,15,0.5,0.45533740520477295
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5097434520721436
1,0,yeah that 's a good idea . just one ? does that mean that one button has a special form or,15,0.5,0.5460849404335022
0,0,i think there 's just one button so,15,0.5,0.3544817566871643
1,0,yeah okay .,15,0.5,0.5929341316223145
1,0,handy .,15,0.5,0.7249977588653564
1,0,"well well there we go . so i 'm just gon na have to redraw this now . so we 're not gon na have the l_c_d_ anymore , and we 'll just gon na have an on t on the t_v_ it 'll show you what you 're doing , which i think is fair enough , and so this is gon na be one big thing here . um .",15,0.5,0.5493204593658447
0,0,was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ?,15,0.5,0.4226350784301758
1,0,what do you mean by profile ?,15,0.5,0.6139577627182007
1,0,sort of flat as possible .,15,0.5,0.5264335870742798
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.635699987411499
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5574352741241455
0,0,you see i envision it as being um quite deep,15,0.5,0.49842438101768494
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6134673953056335
0,0,sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .,15,0.5,0.45866402983665466
1,0,"yeah that 's what i was thinking , to",15,0.5,0.6364412307739258
1,0,we did n't have enough play-doh to make it three d_ .,15,0.5,0.5286674499511719
1,0,"sure , okay . yeah alright yeah fair enough .",15,0.5,0.5060529112815857
1,0,"okay , just thought i 'd ask .",15,0.5,0.6411851048469543
1,0,"so there 's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add ,",15,0.5,0.5169340372085571
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5466248393058777
1,0,"and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height .",15,0.5,0.5163648724555969
0,0,right okay .,15,0.5,0.4994610548019409
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5924856662750244
0,0,"so just to well to be thorough then , width-wise we 're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?",15,0.5,0.48751896619796753
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5615240335464478

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.43207091093063354
1,0,how how tall do you envisage it being ? about that big ?,15,0.5,0.637549102306366
0,0,two .,15,0.5,0.4991036653518677

0,0,"about two centimetres , okay .",15,0.5,0.4546457529067993
1,0,two 's not very high at all though .,15,0.5,0.635971188545227
1,0,this is about this is about two .,15,0.5,0.57100510597229
0,0,maybe a bit higher ?,15,0.5,0.42436516284942627
1,0,"slightly more than two , so",15,0.5,0.6107238531112671
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5806688666343689

0,0,"okay . ach , that is",15,0.5,0.4875335693359375
1,0,maybe closer to three even or two and a half .,15,0.5,0.5401679277420044
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4443991482257843
1,0,yeah . okay we 'll s we 'll say two point five . okay um so we have it within cost anyway . um so yeah project evaluation is this point . um .,15,0.5,0.5232751369476318
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5305235385894775
1,0,right uh . okay so can we close that ? this is what it 's the final spec that it 's gon na be . someone is gon na have to,15,0.5,0.5703317523002625
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.45244377851486206
1,0,yeah that 's fine that 's fine .,15,0.5,0.5805392265319824
1,0,"um it 's probably just i dunno if it 's worth getting into , but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because i 've seen there 's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that",15,0.5,0.5047551989555359
1,0,"i think that 's something that 's very hard to catch ,",15,0.5,0.5863195061683655
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5019063949584961
1,0,so you you restrict the number of people who wan na try something .,15,0.5,0.5599537491798401
1,0,"sure , okay .",15,0.5,0.5514242649078369

1,0,"yeah , alright .",15,0.5,0.7262016534805298
0,0,but i think that there 's also that factor of if it 's too unfamiliar,15,0.5,0.4695342183113098
0,0,"okay , sure .",15,0.5,0.4571068286895752
1,0,then um because when you put it on the shelf,15,0.5,0.52333003282547
0,0,what about button shape ? square buttons ?,15,0.5,0.4624626338481903
0,0,"yeah button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning ,",15,0.5,0.4165806472301483
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.614510178565979
0,0,'cause i think positioning is we 're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of,15,0.5,0.4146311283111572
1,0,yeah . sure .,15,0.5,0.5890233516693115
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5681883692741394
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5398057699203491
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.525052011013031
1,0,pad .,15,0.5,0.5638866424560547
1,0,"right um . so at this point we uh , let me see , discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us i guess .",15,0.5,0.5721638798713684
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.3592345416545868
1,1,okay . go right to my first my next slide .,15,0.5,0.5432809591293335
0,0,uh okay .,15,0.5,0.4380940794944763
1,0,"um alright , my method is uh i 'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wan na see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so i 've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . i s i spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . and then when i 'm out um in people 's houses or at meetings or anything like that , i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it 's convenient in the conversation i ask about it . and i would encourage you all to do the same . um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . um people like something that really fits in their hand .",15,0.5,0.6148703098297119
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.4242546856403351
1,0,"simple is beautiful . they do n't want to have to squint at small print um , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , and they do n't care for the mode thing . they want each button to do something . and eye-catching is important . it 's got ta look cute , it 's got ta look appealing . go ahead , i 'm trying to finish fast for you . um and our preference is , as far as i 'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item . and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . if we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we do n't get anywhere . so we 've got ta narrow our selection down to li two things , i think , that we gon na say are really great about our our our new product . and i 've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular . and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . so those are things maybe we wan na look at as far as saleability of the item .",15,0.5,0.560078501701355
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.35222959518432617
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5547438859939575
1,1,"it seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child 's remote . do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? and have it abstract . you know ,",15,0.5,0.529335618019104
0,0,possibly .,15,0.5,0.4872249960899353
1,0,"we could call like a fruit name ,",15,0.5,0.5503332018852234
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3365572392940521
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.686077892780304
1,0,but it would be a little more abstract .,15,0.5,0.6129047870635986
0,0,mm . we we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you 'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy,15,0.5,0.44495120644569397
1,0,that also is possible .,15,0.5,0.5441778302192688
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5273820161819458
1,0,just,15,0.5,0.5359196662902832
1,0,i 'm just just throwing out ideas .,15,0.5,0.7089694142341614
0,0,or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow .,15,0.5,0.44814884662628174
1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5352229475975037
1,0,yeah . i 'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so,15,0.5,0.5258755087852478
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5512744188308716
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5812482237815857
1,0,"uh just something else i need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? this is actually the volume up and down ,",15,0.5,0.6007061004638672
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5073269605636597
1,0,"but they both say v_ on them ,",15,0.5,0.5277039408683777
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5040971636772156
0,0,"which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow ,",15,0.5,0.4924236238002777
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5036349296569824
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6250879168510437
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4908320903778076
1,0,"but it 's actually the v_ to indicate that it 's the volume , so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .",15,0.5,0.5687376260757446
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6278266906738281
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.39908838272094727
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6474387049674988
1,0,nice . good point .,15,0.5,0.7562785744667053
0,0,"but we would n't have a specific volume up and down . if we 're having the scroll wheel , then it 's gon na double up as all the other up and down functions .",15,0.5,0.47283557057380676
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.3047258257865906
1,1,okay .,15,0.5,0.5650233626365662
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5824154615402222
1,0,"so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we 've taken . uh i will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will uh show us the various investigation they 've done during uh previous uh hours . we 'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have a simple interface . we also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . we have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no l_c_d_ no voice features . so now uh we will have three presentations . so the conceptual specification by industrial designer , the specification of the u_i_ by or u_i_",15,0.5,0.5013834834098816
1,0,abdul al-hasred is my name .,15,0.5,0.5186445116996765
1,0,okay . and uh the last point is uh trend watching by market expert . so maybe we can start with uh industrial design . so this is the presentation .,15,0.5,0.5252595543861389
0,0,"uh , i_d_ you want ?",15,0.5,0.4923556447029114
1,0,maybe i can switch slide uh on your request .,15,0.5,0.5965955257415771
0,0,"yeah . i only v have three slides , so . i just look at the mm um just this . on some web pages to find some documentation",15,0.5,0.45750147104263306
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.646865725517273
0,0,"and i think a remote control is , as i s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . so uh uh i was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh i just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . and um yeah we can change directly .",15,0.5,0.47390031814575195
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5790917873382568
0,0,"in fact i have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . the push button are usually extremely cheap , but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .",15,0.5,0.4338107705116272
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5453406572341919
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.562001645565033
0,0,and i think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button .,15,0.5,0.39578503370285034
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6118152737617493
0,0,uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .,15,0.5,0.441441148519516
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5349688529968262
1,0,but is it a significant price on the whole remote control ?,15,0.5,0.6456810235977173
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3483376204967499
1,0,because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control .,15,0.5,0.5270434021949768
1,0,yeah . yeah,15,0.5,0.6053689122200012
0,0,"so will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve euros to produce ?",15,0.5,0.42744407057762146
1,0,i i th but i do n't think that uh we should we should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money .,15,0.5,0.511375904083252
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4556557238101959
1,0,okay,15,0.5,0.5676881670951843
1,0,also have to say,15,0.5,0.5348293781280518
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.42635196447372437
1,0,did you receive the email about the voice recognition ?,15,0.5,0.6839473247528076
0,0,um that 's all,15,0.5,0.3927503228187561
1,0,no ?,15,0.5,0.5277061462402344
1,0,you received something,15,0.5,0.5357809066772461
0,0,yeah . i have n't chec,15,0.5,0.4556403160095215
1,0,yeah . you we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .,15,0.5,0.6934745907783508
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.2694759666919708
1,0,says yeah . it says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . but i guess it could be,15,0.5,0.6895660758018494
1,0,and could it be adapted ?,15,0.5,0.5094085931777954
0,0,i guess it 's possible . i mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command .,15,0.5,0.4906288981437683
1,0,okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ?,15,0.5,0.5408084392547607
1,0,"yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip",15,0.5,0.5123539566993713
1,0,okay . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5916274189949036
1,0,then we we could use it .,15,0.5,0.5956376791000366
1,0,okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news .,15,0.5,0.5291441679000854
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.45771026611328125
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5700616836547852
0,0,"yeah but i think it 's yeah sorry , i have n't written my personal references . um the i i just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button ,",15,0.5,0.4590184986591339
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4698341190814972
0,0,and if we could reduce that . we we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .,15,0.5,0.4149455726146698
1,0,"mm-hmm . i have a question about that actually . um , what is the purpose of the light ?",15,0.5,0.6340436339378357
0,0,just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber,15,0.5,0.4985589385032654
1,0,is,15,0.5,0.5157715082168579
0,0,you can easily find the button in the dark or so ?,15,0.5,0.3877093493938446
0,0,"but but in th in the dark uh yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ?",15,0.5,0.49019506573677063
1,0,"it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control i think , no ?",15,0.5,0.7188233137130737
0,0,"but if you move it then you have it , you do n't need to find it .",15,0.5,0.40586405992507935
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3587115705013275
1,0,"you can see the buttons better , of course .",15,0.5,0.591482937335968
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5047992467880249
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5884993076324463
1,0,yeah . true .,15,0.5,0.5834041237831116
1,0,yeah . actually .,15,0.5,0.5639069080352783
1,0,but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement .,15,0.5,0.5837743282318115
1,0,as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .,15,0.5,0.5802924036979675
1,0,"yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ?",15,0.5,0.5186443328857422
1,0,yeah . again .,15,0.5,0.6189220547676086
1,0,yeah no it 's too expensive .,15,0.5,0.6472581624984741
0,0,"i do n't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be",15,0.5,0.4614521265029907
1,0,"okay . mm . extra . yeah , okay . mm . yeah , but i expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so ,",15,0.5,0.5186604857444763
1,0,first of all i was thinking to have a a continuous light,15,0.5,0.5114342570304871
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5941748023033142
1,0,"and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device",15,0.5,0.5938585996627808
0,0,mm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.2920827269554138
1,0,"but it can be uh battery consuming , no ? to have the light always on ?",15,0.5,0.6917141079902649
0,0,"yeah , a little bit . a little bit .",15,0.5,0.3088419437408447
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5266802310943604
1,0,well we will discuss that after maybe,15,0.5,0.5275220274925232
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5081321001052856
1,0,okay,15,0.5,0.6278697848320007
1,0,the other presentations .,15,0.5,0.5194060206413269
1,0,". so uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder .",15,0.5,0.5330432653427124
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5891072750091553
1,0,so . it was last time i saw it .,15,0.5,0.566272497177124
0,0,and it is .,15,0.5,0.4657714068889618
0,0,"okay . so ,",15,0.5,0.466482549905777
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5158052444458008
1,0,"just move to the next slide . so basically want very simple , right ? that 's the major idea , as simple as possible .",15,0.5,0.5438934564590454
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5524543523788452
1,0,"so i just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . and let 's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . and in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we do n't need and it become even simpler .",15,0.5,0.5344352722167969
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5797687768936157
0,1,maybe you can give a hand to us because i i 'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve euro and fifty cents .,15,0.5,0.44019031524658203
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5412801504135132
1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5220469236373901
1,0,i 'm sorry to have every time i have to come down on this price again,15,0.5,0.663867712020874
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.40044140815734863
1,0,"to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity ,",15,0.5,0.6906939148902893
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4158344268798828
1,0,but it 's it 's it 's the real we have to consider it . s so,15,0.5,0.6112088561058044
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6342679858207703
1,0,"do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition , i mean maybe it 's possible for for twelve euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the",15,0.5,0.6045544147491455
0,0,mm . hmm .,15,0.5,0.32274168729782104
1,0,"mm-hmm yeah like i would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve euros ,",15,0.5,0.5686470866203308
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5921738743782043
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4173993468284607
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5844184756278992
1,0,"but for the a_s_r_ system , uh i 'm not sure if it 's feasible to have this",15,0.5,0.579539954662323
1,0,we well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit,15,0.5,0.5111992955207825
1,0,we,15,0.5,0.5917012095451355
1,0,and you can uh check how much how much they,15,0.5,0.5283384919166565
0,0,"exactly yeah i if if it 's a low vocabulary it 's already implemented ,",15,0.5,0.48746252059936523
1,0,yeah yeah,15,0.5,0.5980117917060852

1,0,good afternoon .,15,0.5,0.6117559671401978
1,0,i hope you enjoyed your lunch . i did anyway . um let 's see . presentation three . okay this is um the second phase uh we 're going to discuss today . it 's the conceptual design meeting . and a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . uh conceptual specification of design . and also trend-watching . um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you 're going to show me in a few minutes . um but first i 'll show you the agenda . uh first the opening . then we have three presentations . uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . how we 're going to make it . and then we 're closing . we have about forty minutes . uh so i suggest let 's get started . uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? no ?,15,0.5,0.5314464569091797
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.49060696363449097

1,0,"that 's nice . then a little uh thing about the last meeting . uh these are the points um we agreed on . the requirements and the target market . uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . and we are going to use default materials . um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? maybe ? no ? these are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . and maybe we can uh work it out . and we 're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . so now everybody knows what we 're do we 're doing , um i suggest let 's get started with the presentations . so shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ?",15,0.5,0.5340250134468079

0,0,good luck .,15,0.5,0.49517348408699036
1,0,"doh . 'kay i 'm uh gon na inform you about the trend-watching i 've done over the past few days . um we 've done some market research . we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . and um besides that um i deployed some trend-watchers to milan and paris to well get all of the newest trends . and i 've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . um okay these are some overall findings . um most important thing is the fancy design . um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . by innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . um for our um group , we 're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'kay these are some more group specific findings . uh the older people prefer dark colours . uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . um this leads us to some personal preferences . uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . just keep it simple and well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . so this would be very important that we at least include these features . um well the trend-watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . so you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . so they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . so it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . the wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . people with more money . uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . that would be all .",15,0.5,0.6124826073646545

1,0,"no ? okay , we go on to the next one .",15,0.5,0.5300345420837402
1,0,"um 'kay um yeah . uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . so uh um uh that 's w what i what i want to uh uh to do in uh our design . so um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . um the uh i found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . so maybe uh we can uh use uh that . um uh and uh using a little uh display . so um findings . um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . so uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . um uh let 's see . um yeah and uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . so uh it 's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . um and yeah overall um user-friendly . so uh using uh large large buttons . um it 's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . so uh uh yeah . and and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or a and uh yeah . television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . um let 's see . uh yeah . i was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who ca n't uh read small uh subtitles . so uh um yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we 've got um the buttons we have to use . the on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . and um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . so um made a little uh picture of uh it . um see . um yeah . just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button .",15,0.5,0.5383867621421814
0,0,"so um d display uh of it , it 's uh just a small display . uh um you can put it uh on top . um it 's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of looks at . so uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it 's uh on place where um the thumb of of the so you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . um it 's uh quite uh handy place . so um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh i think uh so uh the form of it so",15,0.5,0.43443843722343445

1,0,uh thank you .,15,0.5,0.5158283114433289
0,0,"okay . about the components design . um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . but if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . so i do n't think it 's really an option . uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . it 's really up the the design that we 're gon na use . it 's uh does n't uh imply any technical restrictions . uh as a case supplement , we could um , i thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . and the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we 're using an l_c_d_ uh screen . and as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it does n't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . form should follow function overall . um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . but depends on what we want . i think we should disc discuss that . um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . and the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . and that 's it .",15,0.5,0.4880176782608032

1,0,"there we go . okay , here we are again . detailed design oh , come on . well ah s forgot to insert the minutes , but it 's about the same thing we discussed before . uh could open that anyway , think . other design anyway , we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time . we also that you 're just busy with it . took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . well , we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the other screen , which is fine . um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . yellow in the back because it 's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway . so then we ca yeah . we agreed that we would implement both the l_c_d_ and speech recognition , but i 'll get to that in a moment . 'cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . so so , like i said , we had no insight in finances , no prices ,",15,0.5,0.5562670826911926

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6539545059204102
1,1,um the same electronics and basically all that 's gon na be different is the plastic case .,15,0.5,0.6405645608901978
0,0,hmm hmm .,15,0.5,0.31741368770599365

1,0,um you as an industrial person ?,15,0.5,0.5941988229751587
0,0,well maybe there 's there 's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ?,15,0.5,0.4127422571182251
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.43965286016464233

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5268978476524353
0,0,that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let 's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .,15,0.5,0.4181564450263977
1,0,well there 's a real idea yeah . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6813595294952393
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4001963436603546

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5693685412406921
0,0,"you know ,",15,0.5,0.48675042390823364

1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5306675434112549

1,0,uh yeah .,15,0.5,0.6140005588531494

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5162662863731384

1,0,"should be just loading . okay . oh , although i ca n't see it on my screen . that says go here . okay . i 've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what 's available to us f to actually make the remote control . um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .",15,0.5,0.625853955745697

0,0,. but it 's yeah . it would be like going a step back in time .,15,0.5,0.4838372766971588
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5741294026374817
1,0,i do n't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology .,15,0.5,0.6025896668434143
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.40228378772735596
1,0,"whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that 's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . i mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . um , or there 's solar power , which we 've been considering inside a building , which is where it 's gon na be used , might not be quite so useful .",15,0.5,0.5214192271232605
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5691693425178528
1,0,"but , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . that 's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . like how it 's comfortable and s sits in the hand . we do n't want something that 's huge and you ca n't pick up . or too small . or too slidy . i know i 've had a remote control before which you could n't tell which was the front and the back ,",15,0.5,0.6358808875083923
0,0,"'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that i 'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button .",15,0.5,0.35508009791374207
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.43760180473327637
1,0,because you ca n't really see which way round it is .,15,0.5,0.6127951741218567
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5987780094146729
1,0,"um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-r_s_i_ . it 's like the same sort of rubber that 's used in stress balls and things like that , so it 's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands .",15,0.5,0.5116634964942932

1,0,i do n't think that 's quite up to date with what we 're looking for here .,15,0.5,0.5467471480369568
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6103520393371582
0,0,"um , titanium is not gon na be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . but , would 've been maybe for future projects . um right our choice for buttons as well . we 've developed some we 've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . i think that was brought up for , um , they 're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you do n't have to use individual buttons . you can just slide up and down . i 'm sure we 're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads .",15,0.5,0.49038004875183105

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7040746808052063
1,0,"um one thing with the scroll buttons though . it , it",15,0.5,0.5254425406455994
0,0,we would have to have an l_c_d_ um,15,0.5,0.42172950506210327
1,0,yeah . that 's true .,15,0.5,0.5766587257385254
1,0,"display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult .",15,0.5,0.6450664401054382
0,0,and that would lead to an advanced yeah . if we have yeah . we 're going on to that later with the advanc with the l_c_d_ that means we 'd need a really advanced chip .,15,0.5,0.44833943247795105
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6834326982498169
1,0,and it 's unlikely that that 's gon na be in our budget .,15,0.5,0.5573292374610901
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5455350875854492
0,0,"um , also we 've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we 're most familiar with . it 's the most straightforward . but you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . . got decisions to make there . and this is what i was just saying before . linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . um simple would go with the pushbutton . um , regular you could link with the scroll button . and the advanced we 'd have to go with a l_c_d_ s display .",15,0.5,0.480515718460083
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5182737112045288
1,0,"my personal preferences ? i think we could go for the kinetic energy source . i do n't , i think that 's quite um an advanced kind of technology . it 's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . and also energy saving 'cause you 're producing the energy , you do n't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . you just give it a shake .",15,0.5,0.5581881403923035
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.42904356122016907
1,0,sounds brilliant to me .,15,0.5,0.5640933513641357
1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.6292650103569031
1,0,"rubber casing i thing would probably the best , if we 're going for the anti-r_s_i_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . like it could be pretty much any colour we want . um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple ,",15,0.5,0.5227655172348022
1,0,"then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no l_c_d_ , 'cause we probably ca n't afford that one .",15,0.5,0.5670572519302368
0,0,"yeah . um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as",15,0.5,0.47019490599632263
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3773850202560425
1,0,like as the exterior . this is the one thing that 's protecting its innards .,15,0.5,0.7005509734153748
0,0,"i think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . and the rubber would just be the , what 's in contact with the human .",15,0.5,0.47935470938682556
0,0,yeah . another thing is it might be more difficult if it 's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates .,15,0.5,0.46519550681114197
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5535403490066528
1,0,"um , is it",15,0.5,0.5185837745666504
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.605424702167511
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5545915961265564
1,0,i do n't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . it would work that way .,15,0.5,0.68003910779953
1,0,"maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case .",15,0.5,0.5006714463233948
0,0,w,15,0.5,0.35622915625572205
1,0,"so , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .",15,0.5,0.7890053987503052
0,0,"like plastic with rubber , kind of on top",15,0.5,0.29543063044548035
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.525985836982727
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6108086109161377
1,0,like i ca n't think of what .,15,0.5,0.5633478164672852
1,0,"well , there 's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing ,",15,0.5,0.519213855266571
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4290502369403839
1,0,yeah . or like an,15,0.5,0.6144427061080933
1,0,b like a nokia it is .,15,0.5,0.5157598853111267
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6519715189933777
0,0,"you can get sort of outer casing for ipods and something , that 's just it 's protective as well .",15,0.5,0.48177725076675415
1,0,it 's yeah .,15,0.5,0.528053879737854
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7071368098258972
1,0,like the skin ?,15,0.5,0.5163419246673584
0,0,"it , it stops it , i mean ,",15,0.5,0.4186938405036926
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5552840828895569
1,0,"it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it would n't damage itself so easily .",15,0.5,0.5652904510498047
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5546521544456482
1,0,alright . so maybe the,15,0.5,0.5572878122329712
0,0,"i think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe .",15,0.5,0.4539446234703064
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5087031722068787
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5613143444061279
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5993902087211609
1,0,so the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber .,15,0.5,0.598312497138977
0,0,and then yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.3918437361717224
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5101941823959351
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5406937599182129
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5925341844558716
0,0,and the buttons obviously are rubber .,15,0.5,0.41659894585609436
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5796427130699158
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5398057699203491
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5406937599182129
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.72312331199646
1,0,"that sounds good . i , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?",15,0.5,0.517296552658081
0,0,as far as i know . it should be .,15,0.5,0.41656604409217834
1,0,"okay ,",15,0.5,0.5373942852020264
1,0,we 'll just say yeah .,15,0.5,0.534555971622467
0,0,"yes , just why not .",15,0.5,0.4807777404785156
1,0,"yeah . yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5850599408149719
1,0,alright . i like the kinetic energy source idea .,15,0.5,0.56611567735672
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5037921667098999
1,0,"um , i do n't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot .",15,0.5,0.6477082371711731
0,0,i thought that was,15,0.5,0.47587788105010986
0,0,"but i think that it 's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um",15,0.5,0.47574663162231445
1,0,"yeah , tha",15,0.5,0.6180943250656128
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6011934876441956
1,0,energy source . it could make an we could have any kind of style .,15,0.5,0.5062924027442932
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6248347759246826
1,0,"it would n't be as heavy or bulky , and",15,0.5,0.5299140214920044
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5442442297935486
1,0,yeah . just for environmental reasons .,15,0.5,0.5532850027084351
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5539798140525818
0,0,i guess it 's a bit scary 'cause it has n't been done before .,15,0.5,0.464657723903656
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5571327805519104
1,0,so it seems we 'd have to do more research on it .,15,0.5,0.6283172965049744
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.35342973470687866
1,0,or i dunno if you could have a battery pack .,15,0.5,0.6317191123962402
0,0,like as a backup for something .,15,0.5,0.40724632143974304
0,0,backup . yeah .,15,0.5,0.42556634545326233
1,0,"yeah so there 's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries i believe .",15,0.5,0.6367782354354858
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3898766338825226
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5094608664512634
1,0,"so , if it was running off of one battery as a",15,0.5,0.6289258003234863
0,0,that would be good yeah .,15,0.5,0.4172389805316925
1,0,yeah . some alternative just in case something went wrong .,15,0.5,0.5689585208892822
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.4582684636116028
1,0,"maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power .",15,0.5,0.6781313419342041
0,0,that 's true . i just thought of that .,15,0.5,0.3602699637413025
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5947006940841675
1,0,so maybe that could be incorporated as,15,0.5,0.562021791934967
0,0,may maybe that could be the backup .,15,0.5,0.4982919991016388
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.47679752111434937
1,0,instead of a battery .,15,0.5,0.6291848421096802
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4518797993659973
1,0,like solar backup .,15,0.5,0.5892614722251892
1,0,"although it needs some light , does n't it ?",15,0.5,0.500094473361969
1,0,yeah . i suppose,15,0.5,0.6508503556251526
0,0,"yeah , you can watch a t_v_ in the dark then .",15,0.5,0.4502762258052826
1,0,"do , do those calculators",15,0.5,0.5891937613487244
1,0,s but some,15,0.5,0.5946884751319885
0,0,"so , if we 're doing",15,0.5,0.4826818108558655
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5803658366203308
0,0,yeah . if we 're,15,0.5,0.4274252951145172
1,0,"but thing is , it 's not you do n't need the solar all the time .",15,0.5,0.6543241143226624
0,0,i do n't know how it works .,15,0.5,0.35517120361328125
1,0,it can be stored . it can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it .,15,0.5,0.5082992315292358
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5635955333709717
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6167108416557312
1,0,it just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day .,15,0.5,0.5536393523216248
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5825893878936768
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.634975016117096
1,0,like a few hours a day . .,15,0.5,0.5655507445335388
1,0,i think that might be a little impractical though .,15,0.5,0.5975091457366943
0,0,"yeah . i think sometimes it 's just shoved under , under a cushion ,",15,0.5,0.4627145230770111
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.645573616027832
1,0,and yeah .,15,0.5,0.6099594235420227
1,0,that 's true . it could easily,15,0.5,0.5299867391586304
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5131157636642456
1,0,like people do n't wan na have to worry about that .,15,0.5,0.5996428728103638
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4745695888996124
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5838921070098877
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5815240740776062
1,0,"i suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , i forgot to charge my remote today .",15,0.5,0.5869394540786743
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4431321620941162
1,0,"like if the kinetic thing , i think what 's best about that is that it 's instant energy .",15,0.5,0.5998141169548035
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4756927788257599
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6077340841293335
1,0,"you do n't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever .",15,0.5,0.5389907956123352
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.589038074016571
1,0,and it works .,15,0.5,0.5571507811546326
1,0,or just like pick it up when you 're gon na use it .,15,0.5,0.5711890459060669
0,0,yeah . instead of you do n't have to like make sure it 's in the right place to charge and .,15,0.5,0.4681694209575653
1,0,"yeah , i suppose .",15,0.5,0.6420930624008179
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5832439064979553

1,0,there we go .,15,0.5,0.5615028738975525
0,0,thanks . oh . it 's not on my screen .,15,0.5,0.4786987602710724
1,0,it was n't on mine either .,15,0.5,0.5516576766967773
0,0,why ?,15,0.5,0.4593873620033264
1,0,"i do n't know why . i think , i just , i just used the mouse on there .",15,0.5,0.5175786018371582
1,0,you do n't know why ? oh okay . is it that one ?,15,0.5,0.5434315800666809
1,0,yeah . that 's um,15,0.5,0.5367399454116821
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5766898989677429
1,0,"um , i 'm just gon na go through the interface concept with yous now . uh , first of all i 'll explain what a user interface is . it 's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user . and it 's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . um , there are two types of user interfaces . there 's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . so that 's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about .",15,0.5,0.5545033812522888
1,0,oh . okay . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5101869106292725
1,0,yeah . i 'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that 's on an l_c_d_ screen .,15,0.5,0.5834236145019531
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.44302576780319214
1,0,or maybe it 's the the buttons or pictures or something .,15,0.5,0.5652302503585815
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4069824516773224
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6617615818977356
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6101526021957397
1,0,do you think it 's,15,0.5,0.5304368138313293
1,0,"yeah , 'cause",15,0.5,0.5806946158409119
1,0,so i suppose sometime,15,0.5,0.5572952032089233
1,0,i 'm sorry ?,15,0.5,0.5269119739532471
1,0,after you .,15,0.5,0.5398637652397156
1,0,"um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . you 're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want .",15,0.5,0.5170489549636841
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.657132625579834
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5213510990142822
1,0,"so you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics .",15,0.5,0.5380884408950806
0,0,i s i suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol .,15,0.5,0.4872686266899109
1,0,like an l_c_d_ screen .,15,0.5,0.5560676455497742
1,0,"and if you wanted to go onto teletext or ,",15,0.5,0.5402247309684753
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.42532476782798767
1,0,"i know we 're not having that , but i mean a similar thing ,",15,0.5,0.6283949017524719
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.49726200103759766
0,0,"you , they have there 's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which i suppose it 's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button .",15,0.5,0.4982419013977051
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.669081449508667
1,0,"but if we 're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably wo n't have to focus so much on that .",15,0.5,0.5432882905006409
1,0,"yeah , we 'll be doing",15,0.5,0.6256649494171143
1,0,it 'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .,15,0.5,0.5305940508842468
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6824483871459961
1,0,"yeah . it 'd be more a command interface , and then",15,0.5,0.5856067538261414
1,0,"i suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that .",15,0.5,0.5298161506652832
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.617148220539093
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6650047302246094
1,0,so it 's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ?,15,0.5,0.5722789764404297
0,0,i,15,0.5,0.4648887515068054
1,0,"the infrared is like , that 's considered a",15,0.5,0.5736653208732605
0,0,hmm ?,15,0.5,0.39605799317359924
1,0,"no i think it 's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that 's on the buttons of the remote control , and per",15,0.5,0.6125601530075073
1,0,okay . so when it says pointing device that does n't include,15,0.5,0.5184356570243835
1,0,for inp,15,0.5,0.5945488214492798
1,0,"well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen .",15,0.5,0.6623823046684265
1,0,yeah . i think they 're talking about l_c_d_ type things .,15,0.5,0.5356752872467041
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.29642146825790405
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5382853150367737
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5168154239654541
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5406937003135681
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6244370341300964
1,0,"but um i think we 're gon na go with the command interface anyway ,",15,0.5,0.5300783514976501
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6494991779327393
1,0,"to make it more simplistic . but the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points ,",15,0.5,0.5685628056526184
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5444015264511108
1,0,as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe .,15,0.5,0.5262384414672852
1,0,what do you mean ?,15,0.5,0.5709806680679321
0,0,"like i ca n't think of an example , but sort of like little pictures rather than",15,0.5,0.4617331027984619
1,0,"oh yeah , like how the buttons",15,0.5,0.5349339842796326
1,0,"like a little sound . instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something .",15,0.5,0.6174236536026001
0,0,"yeah , as a button though .",15,0.5,0.49812451004981995
1,0,"yeah , something y",15,0.5,0.5600982904434204
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.34367847442626953
1,0,"so , it 's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ?",15,0.5,0.5720214247703552
0,0,yeah m perha yeah . yeah . maybe .,15,0.5,0.4735662639141083
1,0,okay . yeah . i like that idea .,15,0.5,0.5385792851448059
1,0,"um , the co uh we 've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . as it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly . um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we 'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . you know , make it more trendy and original . we 'll have more money if we keep it simple .",15,0.5,0.5782833099365234
0,0,"yeah . i 'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . a bit more too , yeah .",15,0.5,0.36899253726005554
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6966955065727234
0,0,"yeah . seeing as it 's quite a new technology . um we , we also have to keep in mind when we 're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms are n't always helpful .",15,0.5,0.47818171977996826
0,0,yeah . that 's true . that 's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things .,15,0.5,0.39281660318374634
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6483136415481567
0,0,"it can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming .",15,0.5,0.4467097520828247
1,0,"yeah . and that all interfaces are different . so , um , that does n't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that 's easy to understand . and maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .",15,0.5,0.6850761771202087
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5400721430778503
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.37301403284072876
1,0,does anyone have any questions ?,15,0.5,0.7795391082763672
0,0,"do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look .",15,0.5,0.3790750503540039
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5254310369491577
0,0,"i think if we go with the um design plate thing , we 'll have to . just because of colour clashing ,",15,0.5,0.46995776891708374
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6514413952827454
1,0,"and if we wanted to ,",15,0.5,0.529944121837616
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6210123300552368
0,0,"so and , and we might , i mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .",15,0.5,0.4712909162044525
1,0,but um,15,0.5,0.5337807536125183
1,0,but what about the lighting up effect ?,15,0.5,0.6104364991188049
0,0,you mean different colours for the lighting or,15,0.5,0.47733500599861145
1,0,"um , well , um , i thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they 'd all light up . and so if they were black , it would n't be possible for them to light up .",15,0.5,0.5259694457054138
1,0,mm-hmm . oh i see what you 're saying .,15,0.5,0.5392165184020996
0,0,"if they were white they would glow , probably .",15,0.5,0.47398558259010315
1,0,well y,15,0.5,0.658796489238739
0,0,if they were made out of rubber .,15,0.5,0.4250407814979553
1,0,oh so you 're picturing the light is coming from the back . i kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .,15,0.5,0.5079024434089661
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.4259374439716339
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.35083067417144775
1,0,"but , but i guess , you mean from the back .",15,0.5,0.5469567179679871
0,0,where would the light come from ?,15,0.5,0.39081332087516785
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5787668824195862
1,0,"i 'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through .",15,0.5,0.662460446357727
1,1,okay . je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . it really looks like a banana .,15,0.5,0.6806921362876892
1,0,it is a banana .,15,0.5,0.5860599279403687
1,0,it is a banana .,15,0.5,0.5776711106300354
0,0,it is the essence of bananas . i would be confused with this thing .,15,0.5,0.3924475610256195
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.28005558252334595
1,0,s,15,0.5,0.5464564561843872
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5212681889533997
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5089266300201416
1,0,how is everyone ?,15,0.5,0.514872133731842
0,0,hi .,15,0.5,0.368824303150177
1,0,hi .,15,0.5,0.5212242603302002
1,0,so we are here for the detailed design meeting .,15,0.5,0.5389654040336609
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5603686571121216
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6147154569625854
1,0,we will uh i will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then uh i 've i will also take notes during this meeting and i will send you uh a summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work .,15,0.5,0.5525336861610413
1,0,and uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . then we will uh evaluate the product . and uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . so,15,0.5,0.5713722109794617
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4976440668106079
1,0,"d let 's start with the cost aspect so so i look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it",15,0.5,0.6166955828666687
0,0,"to be uh to feel spongy ,",15,0.5,0.4235095977783203
1,0,like a banana .,15,0.5,0.710419237613678
0,0,and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera .,15,0.5,0.4190450608730316
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5720248222351074
1,0,"and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros . so which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five euros .",15,0.5,0.5093465447425842
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.49172061681747437
1,1,"uh welcome back after lunch , i hope uh you had a good lunch together . for uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . okay and the agenda will be the opening and uh that 's uh the product manager or secretary that 's me and uh the presentations from the christine and uh agnes and from mister ed . and finally in this meeting we have to decide",15,0.5,0.5329400300979614
1,0,"and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design so we have forty minutes , i think it 's uh little bit uh low , but i i hope we can finish it up so i 'll handle to the the functional team , to the christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept .",15,0.5,0.5445147752761841
0,0,"okay . so uh , if you could open the powerpoint presentation .",15,0.5,0.4611423909664154
1,0,i 'm number two .,15,0.5,0.6139116883277893
1,0,you 're number two . 'kay,15,0.5,0.6169074773788452
0,0,"components design , there we go .",15,0.5,0.47116783261299133
1,0,so uh can we put it in slide show mode ? yeah .,15,0.5,0.5830473899841309
0,0,the next one .,15,0.5,0.46353036165237427
1,0,"right here , is that little that one , yes please .",15,0.5,0.6213539242744446
0,0,thank you .,15,0.5,0.44859883189201355
0,0,i 'll take the mouse . so uh,15,0.5,0.4093568027019501
1,0,"we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition ,",15,0.5,0.5822043418884277
0,0,"you have to have microphone well no you do n't actually i have n't have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way",15,0.5,0.4094352722167969
1,0,it has to it has to hear the speaker,15,0.5,0.609769880771637
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.48329615592956543
1,0,"and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it 's gets lost . um so the other w thing that we so . our method for going about this is we 've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what 's worked , what has n't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials",15,0.5,0.5444141626358032
1,0,"and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing did n't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research .",15,0.5,0.6431528925895691
0,0,"so um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design .",15,0.5,0.3829129934310913
1,0,"course , you know , i wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh does n't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore ,",15,0.5,0.6872274875640869
0,0,"so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that 's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor",15,0.5,0.4853084981441498
0,0,"and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it 's uh goes with the board . uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it 's brittle it gets brittle after a while ,",15,0.5,0.4301745295524597
1,0,"so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium 's also been eliminated uh ,",15,0.5,0.580778956413269
1,0,"the m people in manufacturing said that you could n't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how apple did it with th powerbook i 'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they 've eliminated all of our options except wood .",15,0.5,0.5201919674873352
0,0,at least it 's environmentally friendly .,15,0.5,0.3413744568824768
1,0,"so , this is our finding .",15,0.5,0.5993971228599548
0,0,"and a as she said , it 's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we 're we 're currently uh proposing ,",15,0.5,0.4761934280395508
0,0,uh we 'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second .,15,0.5,0.46606960892677307
0,0,"so then there 's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board ,",15,0.5,0.49308428168296814
0,0,"uh these simple chips , but that 's only works for the bu you do n't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . and um then there was the regular which i regret that i 've forgotten exactly why i 'm eliminating that one . uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender ,",15,0.5,0.469760924577713
1,0,which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip .,15,0.5,0.7020649313926697
0,0,"and uh manufacturing has told us that they 've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um i i 'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um ,",15,0.5,0.4783913791179657
1,0,"you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . i think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then i uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . so this is the findings of our research",15,0.5,0.6169180274009705
0,0,and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . do you have any problems with that ?,15,0.5,0.49027252197265625
0,0,can you go back uh one slide ?,15,0.5,0.4402889907360077
1,0,"i 'm not sure , how do i oh , i know , let 's see .",15,0.5,0.692597508430481
0,0,thank you . yeah .,15,0.5,0.4253261089324951
1,0,let 's go back up here .,15,0.5,0.5827100872993469

1,0,one thing we 'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh,15,0.5,0.648352861404419

1,0,"uh , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5556768178939819
1,0,this one ?,15,0.5,0.5656018853187561
0,0,"i think so , yeah . yeah , that 's the one . so , it 's a very short presentation , 'cause i 'm actually gon na draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of",15,0.5,0.4248730540275574
1,0,"i took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which i completely agree with christine 's idea to have it sort of molded , so it 's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .",15,0.5,0.5995663404464722
0,0,"right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example .",15,0.5,0.22605890035629272
1,0,"so , that 's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . um , one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones ,",15,0.5,0.5998588800430298
0,0,"so that you do n't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they 're not pressing the buttons while you 're trying to watch a t_v_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off .",15,0.5,0.39781904220581055
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4048461318016052
1,0,"and also um you had issues with the batteries running out ,",15,0.5,0.5105529427528381
0,0,"so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . and in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition .",15,0.5,0.48028165102005005
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3410855829715729
1,0,"so , in terms of what this thing would actually look like",15,0.5,0.6575221419334412
0,0,"despite working in interface design , i 'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you 'll have to forgive me . you 'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you do n't accidentally turn your t_v_ off while you 're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . and then here you 'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your t_v_",15,0.5,0.32060959935188293
1,0,"and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . so that if the user does n't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you do n't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you .",15,0.5,0.7219492197036743
0,0,mm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.29942160844802856
1,0,"um , so again you can have a little l_c_d_ light somewhere , the flip thing and have i forgotten anything ? i do n't think so . so , as you can see , it 's a very very simple design ,",15,0.5,0.5396496653556824
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5866106748580933
1,0,"which is one of the things i really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .",15,0.5,0.5042558908462524
0,0,a hinge . be like a copper hinge or you know .,15,0.5,0.46786272525787354
1,0,"yeah . but you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you do n't want it to start getting too heavy .",15,0.5,0.6068269610404968
0,0,mm-hmm . mm .,15,0.5,0.36319878697395325
1,0,"but that 's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . as you can see , there 's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences .",15,0.5,0.578449547290802
0,0,"mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.44856131076812744
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4076807200908661
1,0,"so , that 's pretty much all i had to say , i mean , everything else in terms of design issues . um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control ,",15,0.5,0.6567450165748596
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5494083762168884
0,0,the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it 's used less frequently .,15,0.5,0.48939043283462524
1,0,mm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5594986081123352
0,0,"so once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less i think it should go along those lines .",15,0.5,0.49021968245506287
1,0,"so what 's your , uh , the comments or uh s",15,0.5,0.509182870388031
0,0,simple design . it 's what consumers want .,15,0.5,0.4983721673488617
1,0,okay,15,0.5,0.5641701221466064
0,0,"it 's almost like , houston , we have a product here .",15,0.5,0.40938013792037964
1,0,problem is obviously gon na be cost .,15,0.5,0.6047461032867432
1,1,yeah . so we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily . i mean th the autoseek is is not a problem .,15,0.5,0.5779492855072021
1,0,no that 's the,15,0.5,0.550674319267273
1,0,"i mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it 's it 's saved . it 's easier , it 's it 's it 's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap .",15,0.5,0.5304269194602966
1,0,yeah . so but,15,0.5,0.5887494683265686
1,0,so we have to think of something for that .,15,0.5,0.6851616501808167
0,0,um the user interface designer can design a menu for all these function i put them on the,15,0.5,0.4105575978755951
1,0,yeah k kind of structure into layers .,15,0.5,0.5092882513999939
1,0,on the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the yeah 'cause it 's now there are lots and lots of documents,15,0.5,0.5930666327476501
1,0,. yeah . yeah i can .,15,0.5,0.5550810098648071
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.45491886138916016
1,0,i 'll just try to reorganise uh things . um,15,0.5,0.6262355446815491
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.43946412205696106
0,0,so you design the basic function menu for the l_c_d_ screen ? uh um i think,15,0.5,0.4607774317264557
1,0,and and the layout of of the thing itself .,15,0.5,0.5880069136619568
0,0,th i think the yeah the layout of the screen,15,0.5,0.400189071893692
1,0,the the layout of the remote control ?,15,0.5,0.5847683548927307
0,0,and i think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the,15,0.5,0.4137912094593048
1,0,.,15,0.5,0.620914101600647
1,0,is n't that more the the u uh the user interface part ?,15,0.5,0.5170184969902039
1,0,. no i d i think that 's more in .,15,0.5,0.6528937816619873
0,0,uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote i think are in my department .,15,0.5,0.49367421865463257
0,0,maybe more on,15,0.5,0.4654330611228943

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6865598559379578
1,0,"i have to know what it has to do , so if you wan na you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , i have to integrate that in the design .",15,0.5,0.5439755916595459
1,0,okay . so he 's layout and you 're function .,15,0.5,0.551505982875824
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6007516384124756
1,0,form function okay .,15,0.5,0.5328409075737

1,0,"it 's not that important , no .",15,0.5,0.5242236256599426
1,0,you could put it somewhere here .,15,0.5,0.5503398776054382

0,0,around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection .,15,0.5,0.35626110434532166
1,0,it 's can i have that ? that 's j,15,0.5,0.5959132313728333
1,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.5640184879302979

1,0,take this out and here see,15,0.5,0.5259072184562683
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5614885091781616
0,0,"uh are we gon na take triangles anyway ? i 'm drawing triangles , but",15,0.5,0.4305609166622162
1,0,"that 's pretty much what people are accustomed to ,",15,0.5,0.6634528636932373
0,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.45299267768859863
1,0,are n't they ?,15,0.5,0.595880925655365
1,0,"it 's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . so anyway , i think this is should be the channels and or sh",15,0.5,0.5282114148139954
1,0,"well ,",15,0.5,0.57623291015625
1,0,wha,15,0.5,0.6197719573974609
0,0,i 'm accustomed to the channels being on top .,15,0.5,0.45919767022132874
1,0,no . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6840298175811768

1,0,"yeah , that 's better .",15,0.5,0.587053656578064
1,0,should we chan,15,0.5,0.5532646179199219
1,0,on the right .,15,0.5,0.5667868256568909
0,0,"okay , this two , channel up and down .",15,0.5,0.4109025001525879
1,0,shall we uh also look if it 's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? that you do n't have to buy new batteries if every,15,0.5,0.7035670280456543
0,0,"well ,",15,0.5,0.33719566464424133
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4959582984447479
1,0,for that is it 's on one part it 's um it 's a good thing to recharge it,15,0.5,0.6075974702835083
0,0,maybe it 's more ex expensive .,15,0.5,0.40053853392601013
0,0,"mm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.41764771938323975
1,0,maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example .,15,0.5,0.5559117794036865
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.37187594175338745
1,0,"you have just put penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it 's an it 's it 's it 's very annoying .",15,0.5,0.6346763968467712
0,0,but is n't that expensive in the entire package ?,15,0.5,0.4053633213043213
1,0,but that 's already possible .,15,0.5,0.5100559592247009
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6937516927719116
0,0,"i 'm not sure y i 'm not sure it 's if it 's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . because if it 's it 's uh useful to have it rechargeable ,",15,0.5,0.4405028223991394
0,0,"but at the same time , if you do n't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wan na watch t_v_ now , you wan na be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour .",15,0.5,0.47934436798095703
0,0,"yes . yes . okay . uh you could make a device , but i 'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable ,",15,0.5,0.47968539595603943
0,0,i think i have a nice idea .,15,0.5,0.4869173467159271
1,0,"but it you 're the remote also can act as a recharger . so then you can choose , you have every decision . know what i mean ?",15,0.5,0.5743305683135986
0,0,not exactly uh .,15,0.5,0.3649797737598419
1,0,"you can uh put in normal penlites , rechargeable penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire .",15,0.5,0.6678179502487183
0,0,hmm . yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.29463914036750793
1,0,"i think it 's uh it 's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the t_v_ . could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it .",15,0.5,0.6874067187309265
0,0,so but,15,0.5,0.45344826579093933
0,0,"yeah , that 's g",15,0.5,0.4939177334308624
1,0,but i think that will cost a lot .,15,0.5,0.658620297908783
0,0,i 'm not sure .,15,0.5,0.3057839572429657
1,0,uh a normal wire would be better .,15,0.5,0.6245130896568298
0,0,a what ?,15,0.5,0.3964809775352478
1,0,"like a like a p_d_a_ , a hand-held . you can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself ,",15,0.5,0.6080718040466309
0,0,"well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal",15,0.5,0.4954143762588501
1,0,you do n't need basic station . yes .,15,0.5,0.5901068449020386
0,0,or so you could put that on a t_v_ for example .,15,0.5,0.4407447874546051
1,0,"that is possible , that 's true .",15,0.5,0.5533484816551208
1,0,"it could be very flat , could be very small .",15,0.5,0.5261423587799072
0,0,but which,15,0.5,0.4614570438861847
1,0,"it 's a very small yeah , i 'm drawing it big now , but so you can put your remote on flat for example .",15,0.5,0.551142156124115
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3181556761264801
1,0,and at the backside of remote just just just a little hole,15,0.5,0.5973750352859497
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4749341607093811
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.639376699924469
0,0,"for example um you just put it down , it recharges for example .",15,0.5,0.41160932183265686
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6152268648147583
1,0,i do n't think it 's very expensive .,15,0.5,0.5572015047073364
0,0,"but again , is n't that too expensive ?",15,0.5,0.49774447083473206
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4902084767818451
1,0,"'cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station",15,0.5,0.562997043132782
1,0,"i 'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that 's what he r",15,0.5,0.5572515726089478
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.295819491147995
1,0,that 's that you that 's what you buy yourself .,15,0.5,0.560253381729126
1,0,"yes . i 'm going to try to find that out . i 'm not sure if there 's information available on this ,",15,0.5,0.5231726765632629
1,0,"it 's just an idea , we have to find out if it 's possible .",15,0.5,0.5914773344993591
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5023483037948608
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.4254249930381775
1,0,and do people actually want that ? to pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ?,15,0.5,0.5997740626335144
0,0,"yeah , they want to pay for it .",15,0.5,0.4236946403980255
1,0,do they want but they want a rechargeable one ?,15,0.5,0.5102831125259399
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5275352597236633
1,0,"i 'm not sure , you should find out if it 's if rechargeable is important .",15,0.5,0.5310408473014832
1,0,th uh there was not a el ask esque,15,0.5,0.5442474484443665
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5289346575737
1,0,hmm . these are uh comfort issues . so i think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort .,15,0.5,0.5774163007736206
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5003921985626221
1,0,"they want to pay for comfort ,",15,0.5,0.526175320148468
1,0,"well , this is comfort .",15,0.5,0.5509347915649414
1,0,"we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it ,",15,0.5,0.5806127190589905
0,0,but f hmm .,15,0.5,0.4384848475456238
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5838804841041565
1,0,"um and yeah , we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .",15,0.5,0.7173109650611877
0,0,hmm . yeah . exactly . i think this is a brilliant product .,15,0.5,0.39365682005882263
1,0,i think it would be good actually .,15,0.5,0.6626735329627991
0,0,i would buy it myself .,15,0.5,0.4994305372238159
1,0,i like the beep part anyway .,15,0.5,0.504521906375885
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.48312196135520935
0,0,so um,15,0.5,0.4976430833339691
1,0,let 's go through the,15,0.5,0.5101470947265625
1,0,i like the covers . that 's a brilliant idea .,15,0.5,0.6012044548988342
0,0,can can we save this or,15,0.5,0.32685908675193787
1,0,covers is covers is good .,15,0.5,0.6245813965797424
0,0,i never thought,15,0.5,0.34325703978538513
1,0,"yeah , it 's oh we can save this . up and saved . we even saved the ant . um okay . so",15,0.5,0.5725070834159851
1,0,what we have is you have i think you have to do a lot of work on if it 's possible for the cost .,15,0.5,0.547620952129364
1,0,"i hope if i have information about that ,",15,0.5,0.5158931016921997
1,0,"maybe yeah ,",15,0.5,0.6858739852905273
0,0,i 'm gon na,15,0.5,0.4124584197998047
1,0,or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay .,15,0.5,0.5188314318656921
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4246990382671356
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7210184335708618
0,0,"we are going for twenty five euros sales price ,",15,0.5,0.47980427742004395
1,0,"yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.5611813068389893
1,0,"but just try to find out what they 're willing to pay for it , because if they 're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers ,",15,0.5,0.5257123112678528
1,0,yeah yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.6253568530082703
1,1,"okay , um looking at the interface concept , it 's gon na be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . uh if you wan na start the next slide .",15,0.5,0.5063592195510864
1,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.5687021613121033
1,0,"um uh ca n't really see , but there 's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . and then also there 's the idea of the base . that 's sort of like an idea there . and then on the right , we have what 's really big trend right now , it 's the ipod . it 's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it 's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced . so if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it , but anyway , next .",15,0.5,0.5401861667633057
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.3930851221084595
1,0,"um there 's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . you 'd you know you 're in the dark , you do n't wan na be looking at the remote control . and the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it 's a v_ , and so yo you 're kind of feeling a v_ like volume up . what it really is is a v_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow .",15,0.5,0.5253490805625916
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5098266005516052
1,0,"and so it 's like a sort of a criticism you 'd probably turn that o the other way up . um but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , um sort of old-fashioned in a way .",15,0.5,0.5879874229431152
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.44283953309059143
0,0,"either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you 're looking at the up and down arrow . and then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that 's the second one down , that sort of thing . so it 's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel .",15,0.5,0.4492657780647278
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5903213024139404
1,0,okay . um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . um this is particularly geared towards children .,15,0.5,0.6404448747634888
1,0,that 's cute .,15,0.5,0.5545085668563843
0,0,"um it 's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . um and you have the shapes and it 's very simplistic and friendly looking . um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch , so it 's like they ch watch , you know , the c_ beebies or something like that ,",15,0.5,0.44106265902519226
1,0,"uh keep them away from other channels . so that 's like another ar um ,",15,0.5,0.5628002285957336
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5877663493156433
1,0,"i mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . you have the wider section for the main controls there . uh you could see how many buttons there are . and then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . on the bottom we probably would n't need that , because it 's more for like a d_v_d_ function which we are not gon na be using . um . so again it 's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that 's where you could put the r_r_ , real reaction .",15,0.5,0.507641077041626
1,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.5337152481079102
1,0,"and then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . none of them i 'm particularly keen on by the way .",15,0.5,0.5495395660400391
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4294586181640625
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6862081289291382
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.49353334307670593
1,0,"but it 's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we 'd like the the button size on this .",15,0.5,0.5838367342948914
0,0,"mm . or i like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever .",15,0.5,0.3518231511116028
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.45970577001571655
1,0,i have four of those remotes .,15,0.5,0.6374487280845642
0,0,good lord .,15,0.5,0.3331349790096283
1,0,"okay . ready ? oh , yeah . okay .",15,0.5,0.5379862785339355
1,1,"so it meant three ,",15,0.5,0.5345897078514099
0,0,", then i would say two or three .",15,0.5,0.4543195068836212

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.47590968012809753
1,0,"yeah , one is high .",15,0.5,0.6102250218391418
1,0,"one 's high-ish is n't it ? ah , okay so yeah , two or three .",15,0.5,0.5566258430480957

1,0,well it has the wee jog-dial,15,0.5,0.5182589888572693
1,0,we had to remove,15,0.5,0.5255701541900635

1,0,"yeah , so we 've had to remove a few of our features we wanted ,",15,0.5,0.6301763653755188
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.29651808738708496

1,0,"yeah ? okay , and um design is simple to use , simple in features .",15,0.5,0.5868207812309265
1,0,"well yeah , i mean it 's really basic looking is n't it ?",15,0.5,0.5047221779823303
0,0,"f f yeah f fairly basic ,",15,0.5,0.49966490268707275

1,0,"yep , that 's fine .",15,0.5,0.5573780536651611
1,0,"yeah , one ? okay . um , soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? we 've used mostly plastic in the end so it 's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .",15,0.5,0.5162078142166138
1,0,yeah i think it 's about five .,15,0.5,0.5737763047218323
1,0,five ?,15,0.5,0.5571869611740112
0,0,five ? that 's really low .,15,0.5,0.48349660634994507

1,0,"yeah , company logo .",15,0.5,0.6278764009475708
1,0,could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? was that an option ?,15,0.5,0.5562748908996582
0,0,"i think it 'll be cost prohibitive ,",15,0.5,0.443121999502182
1,0,i think i 'd probably increase the cost .,15,0.5,0.5186344385147095
1,0,it would cost more than plastic .,15,0.5,0.5389349460601807

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6447481513023376
0,0,"okay , so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here ?",15,0.5,0.38498255610466003
1,0,"out of forty nine , i guess .",15,0.5,0.638460636138916
1,0,"yeah , out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . we are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .",15,0.5,0.5757408738136292
1,0,'s pretty good .,15,0.5,0.5179336667060852
1,0,so it 's pretty good . translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . right ?,15,0.5,0.5434903502464294
1,0,uh yeah .,15,0.5,0.5516403913497925
1,0,i think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about,15,0.5,0.5629785060882568
0,0,"twice that ,",15,0.5,0.4245626926422119

1,0,about thirty one .,15,0.5,0.500903308391571
0,0,"and then invert that , it 's",15,0.5,0.3216196894645691
1,0,"so yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah .",15,0.5,0.5429909825325012
1,0,"oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent .",15,0.5,0.5648265480995178

1,0,"yeah that 's that 's me . i did have one other um one other frame i thought , i mean i i d not knowing how we would deal with this information , i thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .",15,0.5,0.5146515965461731
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.6404046416282654

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6186718344688416

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4633867144584656
1,0,"it 's just discussion . i mean obviously we can just abandon this , it 's fine . i 'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do .",15,0.5,0.512764573097229

1,0,"i do n't know , just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them .",15,0.5,0.6040433049201965
0,0,or sort of our work on setting this up .,15,0.5,0.429678350687027
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6062570810317993
1,0,"yeah . well , is it uh okay i 'll just go through your system then . the the room uh is fairly institutional , but um the main thing is , i think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know ,",15,0.5,0.6065742373466492
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.534187912940979
0,0,"as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we 've gone through this , it 's not really the centre point of creativity , it 's more just a",15,0.5,0.3805040121078491
1,0,well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?,15,0.5,0.7180702090263367
0,0,"d debating yeah , yeah but that 's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .",15,0.5,0.4484885632991791
1,0,but i do n't i do n't think it means the room as in this room . i think it means like you know,15,0.5,0.5714196562767029
1,0,"oh , oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ",15,0.5,0.5252062678337097
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.633817732334137
1,0,"oh right i just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room .",15,0.5,0.5969936847686768
0,0,room . oh yeah .,15,0.5,0.4636010229587555
1,0,"no , of course , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5899090766906738
1,0,well i dunno do you th i think it means um i think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so,15,0.5,0.5277262926101685
0,0,"sorry . huh . yeah . yeah i th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms i 'd say that actually there 's sort of a tease of creativity because we 're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme ,",15,0.5,0.45364826917648315
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5420726537704468
0,0,but then i then we 're told okay use the co company company colours .,15,0.5,0.4897076487541199
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5083816647529602
0,0,"so what do we do . we 're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds ,",15,0.5,0.4973205626010895
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5447639226913452
1,0,so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual,15,0.5,0.657100260257721
0,0,you feel like you 're caged within whatever y,15,0.5,0.4647614657878876
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5303669571876526
1,0,yeah within the constraints,15,0.5,0.5010561943054199
1,0,"it 's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side .",15,0.5,0.5647962093353271
0,0,the,15,0.5,0.4808133840560913
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.70784592628479
0,0,the constraints do come in very fast .,15,0.5,0.467154860496521
0,0,"okay uh do you know what ,",15,0.5,0.41777101159095764
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5727196335792542
1,0,"actually let 's take each point and everybody discuss it , i think .",15,0.5,0.5900885462760925
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.44816333055496216
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5549177527427673
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6473082304000854
1,0,so still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is craig .,15,0.5,0.5135034322738647
1,0,"um i agree with his point it 's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , got ta cut everything out 'cause we do n't have enough money .",15,0.5,0.5839236378669739
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.49587082862854004
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.652863621711731
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.48854967951774597
1,0,"i think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings ,",15,0.5,0.6129182577133179
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6526337265968323
1,0,"so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure .",15,0.5,0.5221076011657715
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5826522707939148
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6611583828926086
1,0,"because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .",15,0.5,0.5365044474601746
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4372406005859375
1,0,"mm-hmm , mm-hmm . yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6367459297180176
1,0,"and i guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , i think that 's a very big thing ,",15,0.5,0.5475531816482544
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5640036463737488
1,0,and i think the fact that we 're wearing these things restricts,15,0.5,0.579757571220398
1,0,"yeah , sure .",15,0.5,0.561076819896698
1,0,"i feel it 'cause i wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right",15,0.5,0.5499237179756165
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5551748275756836
1,0,"it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .",15,0.5,0.61746746301651
0,0,yeah . new creativity .,15,0.5,0.42080172896385193
1,0,"i feel like i 'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know .",15,0.5,0.6094269752502441
1,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.5072677135467529
1,0,so you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or,15,0.5,0.6183716058731079
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5676324367523193
0,0,"not not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the the gear",15,0.5,0.49960091710090637
1,0,"yeah , but actual environment ?",15,0.5,0.6168773770332336
1,0,yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um,15,0.5,0.5959407091140747
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.43994420766830444
1,0,and and the time the time given also restricts,15,0.5,0.5281040668487549
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5700350999832153
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4629698395729065

1,0,excuse me .,15,0.5,0.5333153009414673
1,0,"i think it 's good . i mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and",15,0.5,0.5969707369804382
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5297361016273499
0,0,"you know , innovative thought with . in in reality i think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within . and so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so",15,0.5,0.4398634731769562
1,0,"uh-huh , okay .",15,0.5,0.6120897531509399
1,0,"but it 's not bad leadership , it 's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . it turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free",15,0.5,0.567274808883667
1,0,so you think maybe a little too controlling or,15,0.5,0.5532826781272888
1,0,"yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .",15,0.5,0.5793644785881042
1,0,"i think controlling is not the right word , i think the interactions are very structured .",15,0.5,0.6581055521965027
1,0,yeah maybe not co confining .,15,0.5,0.5532256364822388
0,0,"i think structure is probably what you 're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling .",15,0.5,0.4677160084247589
1,0,"yeah . yeah , yeah . mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.5323624014854431
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.559055745601654
1,0,"i do n't think there 's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it ,",15,0.5,0.5874808430671692
0,0,"mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.45866653323173523

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5857454538345337
0,0,"mm . mm-hmm , mm-hmm . yeah .",15,0.5,0.4502483308315277
1,0,"okay , uh what about teamwork ?",15,0.5,0.6319486498832703
1,0,"um did , you wan na comment craig ?",15,0.5,0.5888973474502563
0,0,"uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .",15,0.5,0.4587245583534241
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5498751401901245
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6060476899147034
1,0,"if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would 've been a lot easier .",15,0.5,0.5941420197486877
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3851484954357147
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5605572462081909
1,0,"i think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate ,",15,0.5,0.544417679309845
1,0,fully agree .,15,0.5,0.5357878804206848

1,0,not just yet .,15,0.5,0.5281618237495422
1,0,i was wondering if that got there okay .,15,0.5,0.5097224116325378
0,0,"yeah , got the email .",15,0.5,0.49950364232063293
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5934838652610779
1,0,"okay , um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier .",15,0.5,0.5449491143226624
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5868527293205261
1,0,"i think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they do n't support collaboration , i think that 's the word .",15,0.5,0.545106053352356
1,0,"yeah , in it mm-hmm ,",15,0.5,0.6576102375984192
0,0,"they do n't support the team working together , you know ,",15,0.5,0.4533507823944092
1,0,"mm-hmm , mm-hmm ,",15,0.5,0.5649933815002441
1,0,"oh right , okay .",15,0.5,0.5371077060699463
1,0,"exactly . yeah , i mean if you",15,0.5,0.566498339176178
1,0,they 're still very individual tools .,15,0.5,0.5826376676559448
1,0,"yeah , i mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way i see this i is that it 's uh the the s the structure in which we 've we 've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation",15,0.5,0.616151750087738
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4786190092563629
0,0,"i i do n't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different ,",15,0.5,0.4246971905231476
1,0,we had play-doh fun .,15,0.5,0.7519786357879639
1,0,"but um yeah , but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let 's say um a design concept , and we sit here together and do it ,",15,0.5,0.5159110426902771
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5153494477272034
1,0,"well that 's what teamwork is . to s to say okay go off and do n't talk to each other , it 's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .",15,0.5,0.5511603355407715
1,0,yeah . okay .,15,0.5,0.579129695892334
0,0,um not that we have n't done i think the best we could have done .,15,0.5,0.4763581454753876
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5349650382995605
1,0,i 'm not dissatisfied with it .,15,0.5,0.5051472783088684
1,0,"right , uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ?",15,0.5,0.5505102872848511
0,0,"no , not really .",15,0.5,0.4588736295700073
1,0,"okay , um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ? um did anybody think anything was like really useful ,",15,0.5,0.5583482980728149
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3873983323574066
1,0,anything was pretty un f unsupportive ?,15,0.5,0.5591983795166016
0,0,"i think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing i would use all the time , but it 's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .",15,0.5,0.4968582093715668
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.42277607321739197
1,0,"um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . i know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it 's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss",15,0.5,0.5077260136604309
1,0,mm-hmm . yeah . and point at ? yeah .,15,0.5,0.5772228837013245
1,0,"and and and in a way everybody 's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we 're just we 're actually just each of us discussing something that 's in each of our own minds . it was n't until we had this here , you know ,",15,0.5,0.5280590057373047
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5394653081893921
1,0,"like at one point i peeked across and looked at craig 's paper and i 'm like , now i know what he 's thinking 'cause i saw his book .",15,0.5,0.6150771379470825
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.36246609687805176
1,0,but the b the b whiteboard could 've actually been this kind of continuing um,15,0.5,0.6315061450004578
0,0,so do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ?,15,0.5,0.45625194907188416
0,0,"think could be , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4484255015850067
0,0,"i think um the the focus of it a lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,",15,0.5,0.4428863227367401
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5246592164039612
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6378976702690125
1,0,and i think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things i think .,15,0.5,0.5391921401023865
1,0,"yeah . yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5946031808853149
0,0,"it will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the powerpoint ,",15,0.5,0.48711809515953064
1,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6202037334442139
1,1,"uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .",15,0.5,0.5205016732215881
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5102758407592773
1,0,"um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given . uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . um it 's also an item that people lose a lot . so we should address that . and , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive ,",15,0.5,0.5626552104949951
1,0,"or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that 's a very important fact , 'cause um if they say , well , i go home and think about it , that wo n't work . um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve . and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan .",15,0.5,0.530911922454834
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4000559449195862
1,0,our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip,15,0.5,0.5410061478614807
1,0,"that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . if too many buttons are pressed , mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item . francino who is our um",15,0.5,0.6444329023361206
0,0,interface designer .,15,0.5,0.4536120593547821
1,0,"interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . particularly with maybe small children that they could n't uh watch a channel that is undesirable . it should be compact . her personal favourite was it should be t-shaped . and maybe have an anar alarm-clock . and the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature .",15,0.5,0.5034887790679932
0,0,and even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote .,15,0.5,0.4623776078224182
0,1,"well , i think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done",15,0.5,0.4306555390357971
1,0,and what are your ideas about the,15,0.5,0.5724707245826721
0,0,"about the design or maybe we 'll discuss this later , no ?",15,0.5,0.36160942912101746
1,0,"well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for t_v_ distribution i guess .",15,0.5,0.6495275497436523
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4094577431678772
1,0,so we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh,15,0.5,0.532182514667511
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.38691848516464233
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6073808073997498
1,0,how we can make it work .,15,0.5,0.5881651639938354
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4084930121898651
1,0,i mean working remotes we already have . this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls .,15,0.5,0.6919000148773193
0,0,what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics .,15,0.5,0.2865709662437439
1,0,"yeah , i dunno i",15,0.5,0.5578157901763916
1,0,and of course it should not be very costly .,15,0.5,0.6268588304519653
0,0,"yeah , that 's right .",15,0.5,0.45156630873680115

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5759915113449097
1,0,"well i i think that norman and i would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or",15,0.5,0.5234681963920593
1,0,need to collect information .,15,0.5,0.5601908564567566
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5940290093421936
1,0,about the about what ?,15,0.5,0.6153349876403809
1,0,"um . i i 'm part of design , perhaps . uh , what is most important in a in a remote control ? what is the most important function aspect ? uh .",15,0.5,0.5330522656440735
0,0,you mean the external or,15,0.5,0.4527612328529358
0,0,"well , you have to make it work .",15,0.5,0.44972601532936096
1,0,yeah of g of course .,15,0.5,0.6221128106117249
0,0,that 's alright .,15,0.5,0.39548438787460327
1,0,that 's the that 's the big thing .,15,0.5,0.6007201671600342
0,0,"yeah , it should be easy to work with .",15,0.5,0.42545372247695923
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5818278193473816
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5838921070098877
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6339991688728333
1,0,we can think about an interface with uh well,15,0.5,0.5403560400009155
1,0,uh . we maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . you just tell the television i want which channel .,15,0.5,0.6421751379966736
0,0,you wo n't,15,0.5,0.48337090015411377
0,0,"or or you can say for example , um i want uh to list all the programme tonight . y you know , instead of uh remote control it 's doing the some searching for you , so you do n't have to look for the channel you want . just say maybe i just want to press i wan na have a button for all the movies tonight . or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight . and then you list a few , and i will choose from the list . so instead of pressing the channel number , i am choosing the programmes directly . yeah , that 's one way of uh making it useful .",15,0.5,0.44087672233581543
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5309981107711792
1,0,i i think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly .,15,0.5,0.6122332811355591
0,0,"no , because no ,",15,0.5,0.3264584541320801
1,0,s,15,0.5,0.5700836777687073
0,0,it 's not very a lot . th this information exists . for example you can get um,15,0.5,0.4217236638069153
1,0,like s uh you you you say we can use speech .,15,0.5,0.5423197150230408
0,0,"you can use uh well for example anything . the the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it 's more natural . yeah .",15,0.5,0.447613388299942
0,0,i i think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh i dunno,15,0.5,0.3880937099456787
1,0,i 'm a okay .,15,0.5,0.5389484763145447
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6069561839103699
1,0,i mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand,15,0.5,0.5626539587974548
0,0,in the hand .,15,0.5,0.2958488166332245
1,0,and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control .,15,0.5,0.5956710577011108
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5112512111663818
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5838921070098877
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5300962328910828
1,0,"if we are going to add a speech interface , i 'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog",15,0.5,0.6812136769294739
0,0,"yeah . yes , possible .",15,0.5,0.3472825288772583
1,0,if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that i think the t_v_ itself could have it .,15,0.5,0.6667396426200867
0,0,yeah . but,15,0.5,0.4151341915130615
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6401724815368652
1,0,and i could talk to the t_v_ television itself .,15,0.5,0.5602728724479675
1,0,except if if you are far from the t_v_ .,15,0.5,0.5833277106285095
0,0,i need not have an,15,0.5,0.4982315003871918
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6500753164291382
1,0,"i mean we have some or something , different technology but",15,0.5,0.5573934316635132
0,0,this is it 's,15,0.5,0.4452408254146576
1,0,"yeah , yeah . but th the main idea i wanted to s i wanted to say is that um there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch t_v_ channel , there 's a option you can choose , either t_v_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme .",15,0.5,0.5060266256332397
1,0,on the content .,15,0.5,0.5052717924118042
0,0,"mm-hmm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.49956491589546204
1,0,"yeah , yeah it 's it 's a good idea it 's a good idea",15,0.5,0.601107120513916
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.46988263726234436
1,0,so it 's more powerful . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6246713995933533
0,0,but i i think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to,15,0.5,0.4880511164665222
1,0,"no . no , because you see now all the t_v_ programmes are available on the webs . they they are they are they are available in x_m_l_ format or whatever the format . we do n't care . we just say that this are some content . we just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . some of the websites they already provide this service ,",15,0.5,0.5328598022460938
1,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.5433506369590759
1,0,so we can just use the service available . download it uh to the to this remote control .,15,0.5,0.6226021647453308
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.377320259809494
0,0,"and then there 's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . the most there are only seven buttons . so i just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you do n't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons .",15,0.5,0.36700576543807983
1,0,yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons .,15,0.5,0.5308926701545715
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6176110506057739
1,0,"well i i i i think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so",15,0.5,0.5014264583587646
1,0,this is good idea .,15,0.5,0.6213073134422302
1,0,"yeah . ah , yes . so . yeah . yeah , so you do n't have to display here , just display on the t_v_ screen , right ?",15,0.5,0.5196166634559631
1,0,yeah in the dis display on the t_v_ screen,15,0.5,0.5642521977424622
1,0,good idea . okay .,15,0.5,0.5102587342262268
1,0,and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f,15,0.5,0.6015206575393677
0,0,i think i think that will be revol revolutionary .,15,0.5,0.4009915292263031
0,0,"because all the t_v_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . yeah . alright .",15,0.5,0.4975172281265259
0,0,"yeah , yeah . so i think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff",15,0.5,0.4444344639778137
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5416380167007446
1,0,so we have five minutes to,15,0.5,0.5283001661300659
0,0,ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board .,15,0.5,0.43670979142189026
1,0,"ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we",15,0.5,0.6129322648048401
0,0,five minutes .,15,0.5,0.45590993762016296
0,0,and another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of,15,0.5,0.4951151907444
1,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5142639875411987
1,0,"so , i mean , if you 're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene , the lights adapt themself .",15,0.5,0.5496577620506287
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5656191110610962
1,0,s,15,0.5,0.5927313566207886
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6751405000686646
0,0,the lighting in the room changes .,15,0.5,0.44895079731941223
1,0,"yeah , but we are designing just remote control .",15,0.5,0.6293033957481384
0,0,you it .,15,0.5,0.3802442252635956
0,0,"i mean , we have a option in the remote control . if we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote .",15,0.5,0.46673160791397095
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4348829388618469
1,0,oh right so,15,0.5,0.5023013353347778
1,0,"okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ?",15,0.5,0.6130919456481934
0,0,yeah . if if you you you can if you want you can use th the .,15,0.5,0.4571540057659149
1,0,"please , norman , draw uh",15,0.5,0.566875159740448
0,0,"go on , draw something . mm .",15,0.5,0.42326679825782776
0,0,"oh , i 'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel .",15,0.5,0.49459242820739746
1,0,where is it ?,15,0.5,0.5234074592590332

1,0,um as you may have noticed i uh,15,0.5,0.5697187781333923
0,0,created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder .,15,0.5,0.48080188035964966
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6337119936943054
1,0,"i do n't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting .",15,0.5,0.5337076187133789
1,0,that 's new one ?,15,0.5,0.5314522981643677
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5782548785209656
1,0,we did n't make any uh,15,0.5,0.5660692453384399
1,0,"uh , we should save that one .",15,0.5,0.5092846155166626
0,0,oh in,15,0.5,0.4824633300304413

0,0,did n't we just do that ?,15,0.5,0.4444960653781891
1,0,"yeah , save in the folder . save as project .",15,0.5,0.510985791683197
1,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.5352855920791626
0,0,"oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is .",15,0.5,0.31025058031082153
1,0,"oh , okay .",15,0.5,0.6858351826667786
0,0,and we have a evaluation left here .,15,0.5,0.49150550365448
0,0,hmm hmm .,15,0.5,0.4365938603878021

1,0,hmm ?,15,0.5,0.5331690311431885
1,0,i have it open myself i guess . um well the detailed design meeting huh ? we 're finally getting somewhere hopefully .,15,0.5,0.7049039006233215
0,0,"um what are we going to do ? i 've opened it already . um i 'm still going to take some minutes , and if i 'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ?",15,0.5,0.47003087401390076
1,0,"oh , sorry .",15,0.5,0.6236454248428345

1,0,"yes , you are .",15,0.5,0.533786952495575
1,0,and uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ?,15,0.5,0.594399094581604
1,0,yep . yep .,15,0.5,0.5555715560913086
1,0,"good . and we have a correct agenda . and uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed ,",15,0.5,0.6295658946037292
1,0,oops .,15,0.5,0.5004721283912659
0,0,"and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . okay , well finance uh will be later . now i 'd like to give the word to you two .",15,0.5,0.4019176959991455
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.547822117805481
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5675186514854431
1,0,well uh,15,0.5,0.5358141660690308
0,0,get up stand up . just,15,0.5,0.496482789516449
1,0,we made a prototype .,15,0.5,0.5256668925285339
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.4501427412033081
1,0,we first start with the overall uh this is about the total remote control .,15,0.5,0.6847256422042847
0,0,view .,15,0.5,0.392762690782547
1,0,we made it green .,15,0.5,0.5841957330703735
0,0,"just example colour ,",15,0.5,0.3565528690814972
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.724774956703186
1,0,so uh there 's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype .,15,0.5,0.523952066898346
1,0,"it 's a fresh colour . and uh the screen light blue . oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . and the r_ and r_ logo , it just says r_ and r_ now , but uh",15,0.5,0.5005837082862854
1,0,okay ?,15,0.5,0.5155561566352844
1,0,any questions so far ?,15,0.5,0.593209445476532
0,0,big microphone .,15,0.5,0.4910188317298889
1,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.5649238228797913
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5930246710777283
1,0,just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible .,15,0.5,0.6036956310272217
0,0,"oh okay . that 's the place where it 's going to be , not the size .",15,0.5,0.4901758134365082
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.599861204624176
1,0,"uh well , it 's an idea in a so .",15,0.5,0.5662275552749634
1,0,"oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it 's there and uh",15,0.5,0.510289192199707
1,0,do not forget it .,15,0.5,0.5221941471099854
1,0,uh,15,0.5,0.5364853739738464
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.43696174025535583
1,0,to function it it does n't really have to be sm uh big of course .,15,0.5,0.6679563522338867
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.2183646261692047
1,0,"yeah , okay . of course .",15,0.5,0.7328236103057861
0,0,the microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button .,15,0.5,0.40407148003578186
0,0,"mm . mm , th yeah .",15,0.5,0.4733799993991852
1,0,okay um,15,0.5,0.5535100698471069
1,0,small .,15,0.5,0.5793365836143494
1,0,we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh i uh um,15,0.5,0.5746562480926514
0,0,you push the scroll button,15,0.5,0.46099844574928284
0,0,"yeah , you push the scroll button",15,0.5,0.44487446546554565
1,0,and it 's claps out if there 's a,15,0.5,0.539813220500946
0,0,"and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . for example uh t_v_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera .",15,0.5,0.4567303955554962
1,0,"remote settings , et cetera . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5453271269798279
0,0,"so uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see oh , it 's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . um",15,0.5,0.3550105392932892
1,0,"yeah . and you could also touch it so that it comes out ,",15,0.5,0.564455509185791
0,0,"yeah , that 's c",15,0.5,0.4471532702445984
1,0,and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers .,15,0.5,0.5313191413879395
1,0,yeah . indeed .,15,0.5,0.5486747622489929
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5922269821166992
1,0,"okay , um it 's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it 's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh yes . in an apart uh",15,0.5,0.5279954671859741
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6011168956756592
0,0,"so a separate button for for text ,",15,0.5,0.3977256715297699
0,0,"in a separate button , yeah .",15,0.5,0.49174222350120544
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.547844648361206
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.523208498954773
1,0,perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah .,15,0.5,0.548458993434906
1,0,"a sign , yeah , just like okay , indeed .",15,0.5,0.5754950046539307
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5306146144866943
1,0,"okay ,",15,0.5,0.5685832500457764
1,0,forgot .,15,0.5,0.5169787406921387
1,0,we can uh modify that later . okay . would you like to make any comments about next uh,15,0.5,0.5957611203193665
0,0,"uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the l_c_d_ screen . uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . we put ano an an extra button in . we can erase it , but it 's the button where you can switch channels . just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . yeah , that one , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4726548492908478
1,0,"previous page , yeah , indeed .",15,0.5,0.6272600293159485
1,0,"it has a name . and uh uh we put that in ,",15,0.5,0.6173760294914246
1,0,oh my god .,15,0.5,0.5128199458122253
1,0,"i thought it would be handy there . uh this the one number or two numbers button . below that , the page and the sound . and uh in the middle the the mute . uh battery indicator .",15,0.5,0.5656678080558777
1,0,it 's quite large .,15,0.5,0.5958985686302185
0,0,it 's it 's a bit big .,15,0.5,0.4013972282409668
1,0,"and this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop . or at least it should look like it . and the options uh of teletext .",15,0.5,0.6179450750350952
0,0,"okay . you can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu is n't uh taking uh much uh uh it 's taking much part of the screen , so it 's very uh when you uh when you use it , does n't uh become irritating to see .",15,0.5,0.44174256920814514
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.4828597903251648
0,0,"'cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . 'cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down ,",15,0.5,0.4325767457485199
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5635129809379578
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5280740261077881
0,0,"yeah . well this about it , i think .",15,0.5,0.4649503529071808
0,0,okay . huh .,15,0.5,0.4938453435897827

1,0,"now uh the single curved idea was uh yeah , okay , you ge um",15,0.5,0.6135336756706238
1,0,y you should make uh a sideways uh view .,15,0.5,0.5155599117279053
1,0,"yeah . the sideways view , uh that that that ma",15,0.5,0.5067030191421509

1,0,"so it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here ,",15,0.5,0.5067416429519653
1,0,it works .,15,0.5,0.5601199865341187
1,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.5219955444335938
0,0,"yeah , that 's the single curve indeed .",15,0.5,0.4976024627685547
0,0,yeah . so if you v flip it like this .,15,0.5,0.49396076798439026

1,0,here 's yeah .,15,0.5,0.6575923562049866
1,0,"that 's not very i it 's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there ,",15,0.5,0.5316317677497864
1,0,"yeah . so you just make the back of this part a bit bigger ,",15,0.5,0.5378745794296265

0,0,i think it does .,15,0.5,0.3624173700809479
0,0,i think so .,15,0.5,0.4258793294429779

1,0,and the design .,15,0.5,0.5701698660850525
1,0,well i think uh especially because of the microphone and the l_c_d_ screen also .,15,0.5,0.5325301289558411
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5512326955795288

0,0,i think th it 's,15,0.5,0.32177573442459106
1,0,it 's easier than the regular uh remote control .,15,0.5,0.6936951875686646

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5065505504608154
1,0,"i guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you 're s and then it goes ,",15,0.5,0.5491564273834229
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.46618103981018066

1,0,"oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell you know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while .",15,0.5,0.5522969961166382
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5522937178611755
1,0,"um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it 's touched again .",15,0.5,0.5694618225097656
0,0,mm . so it could be any button that would be pressed .,15,0.5,0.36825406551361084
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6669732928276062

1,0,"so , self-timed",15,0.5,0.6882711052894592

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6311590075492859

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5695856809616089
1,0,"so , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? do we have to kind of decide what we 're gon na do with this .",15,0.5,0.59255051612854

1,0,if,15,0.5,0.5371500253677368
1,0,"like should we do both ? or we can have one or the other ? because it might , for , for our design purposes , i mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour .",15,0.5,0.5090956687927246
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.48900237679481506

1,0,"um , i 've",15,0.5,0.6010452508926392

1,1,so um the question well first of all what to control . so most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and t_v_ and stuff like that .,15,0.5,0.6441258192062378
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.2946430444717407
1,0,and but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff,15,0.5,0.6289786696434021
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.36088570952415466
1,0,and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house .,15,0.5,0.6010703444480896
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.45648786425590515
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5085927248001099
1,0,"yeah , so there 's a project i think called x_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . so",15,0.5,0.5719552636146545
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3279748857021332
1,0,there is one that is one thing . the other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have,15,0.5,0.6048505902290344
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.3317616283893585
1,0,uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah . so i think it should be a package in that case .,15,0.5,0.5635855197906494
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4482336640357971
0,0,"uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . one is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space ,",15,0.5,0.4772176444530487
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.45152080059051514
0,0,a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .,15,0.5,0.38162052631378174
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.47487694025039673
1,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.5625559687614441
1,0,what do you mean by linear access then ?,15,0.5,0.5229833722114563
1,0,"like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah .",15,0.5,0.5243923664093018
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.39640507102012634
1,0,"okay so special navigation , linear access , random access",15,0.5,0.5956017971038818
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.4571763873100281
1,0,and there 's a fourth one no ?,15,0.5,0.5586098432540894
0,0,mm ?,15,0.5,0.38792335987091064
1,0,so the better now for special navigation ?,15,0.5,0.5164363384246826
0,0,yeah . for special navigation for example you might have a t_v_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ?,15,0.5,0.3643287718296051
1,0,okay . then linear access,15,0.5,0.5375757217407227
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.4820237457752228
1,0,then random access .,15,0.5,0.5407637357711792
0,0,mm . yeah and also parameter changing .,15,0.5,0.4263647198677063
1,0,ah yeah parameter okay .,15,0.5,0.605241060256958
0,0,so if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um,15,0.5,0.4266432821750641
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.44264549016952515
1,0,or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff .,15,0.5,0.5598636269569397
0,0,okay . okay and and voice command did you uh,15,0.5,0.38402682542800903
0,0,"voice command w we could specify anything . we could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power ,",15,0.5,0.34934043884277344
1,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5240128636360168
0,0,i guess so . yeah .,15,0.5,0.4655930697917938
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.517104983329773
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6770867109298706
1,0,so that 's uh that close your investigations ?,15,0.5,0.5138254761695862
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4616021513938904
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5406807065010071
1,0,uh yeah i think so .,15,0.5,0.516542911529541
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5677806735038757
1,0,not so far .,15,0.5,0.5590893030166626
0,1,now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .,15,0.5,0.4266945719718933
1,0,"okay , i 'll take my file down so you can bring it up . 'kay should be able to get it now . 'kay , why do n't you move just to the next slide right away .",15,0.5,0.5706892013549805
1,0,you wan na go to the next slide ?,15,0.5,0.5273635983467102
0,0,yeah right away .,15,0.5,0.4302569627761841
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.42583224177360535
1,0,"okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we have n't thought of .",15,0.5,0.5806135535240173
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4139564037322998
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4865465760231018
1,0,"we ca n't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few .",15,0.5,0.5685028433799744
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4363758862018585
1,0,"and show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we do n't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we wo n't sell any .",15,0.5,0.6306579113006592
0,0,mm-hmm . mm .,15,0.5,0.21211841702461243
1,0,so we have to get some input from those people .,15,0.5,0.6777125000953674
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.35479697585105896
0,0,"and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it 's good , we 're gon na get behind it and sell it . um , next slide please . okay , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i did n't want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we 've got that . the size is small , the colour 's bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we 'll have the soft buttons",15,0.5,0.4667239189147949
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5419560074806213
1,0,"and the way this is shaped , even though it 's gon na be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that 's nice . and functionality i put last on my list because people are n't going to use it before they buy it .",15,0.5,0.5037573575973511
1,0,"so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that 's what people are gon na get in the store .",15,0.5,0.6556039452552795
0,0,fee selling .,15,0.5,0.41665953397750854
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5053422451019287
1,0,"they do n't have a television in the store , they ca n't play with it .",15,0.5,0.609481155872345
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5299283266067505
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6425279974937439
1,0,"um so they 'll be our main selling points . so um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please . okay , so um the shape um i think is a a one . that 's really , really excellent shape . the size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these are n't i in how i feel . i think that it 's i think that it 's plenty small enough to sell but i think we 're sort of right the scale is one to seven . i think we 're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors .",15,0.5,0.5238314270973206
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6882308125495911
0,0,"and our colour i think is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we 'd disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality .",15,0.5,0.35356682538986206
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5355542302131653
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5802348256111145
0,0,so i think that basically we 've got a great product and we can get off and running with it .,15,0.5,0.3277997672557831
1,0,um i just realised one thing .,15,0.5,0.7010657787322998
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.41637083888053894
1,0,in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser .,15,0.5,0.6523364186286926
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4824605882167816
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5934486985206604

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6060464978218079
1,0,"and uh i do n't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .",15,0.5,0.6383395195007324
1,0,"well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ?",15,0.5,0.6690843105316162
1,0,"eight , eight twenty , yes .",15,0.5,0.5559793710708618
1,0,eight twenty so,15,0.5,0.5438469052314758
0,0,and so we 've got we 've still got four euros to go to spend .,15,0.5,0.47958919405937195
0,0,"we have um four euros , yeah",15,0.5,0.4127376973628998
1,0,i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty .,15,0.5,0.5922794938087463
0,0,mm-hmm . well um that 's,15,0.5,0.3125738799571991
1,0,"but i mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much .",15,0.5,0.5713953375816345
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.501976728439331
1,0,so um we just have to beware of that . i mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .,15,0.5,0.5451290607452393
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4159504473209381

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6031829714775085
1,0,so we 're just gon na have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .,15,0.5,0.5173120498657227
1,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.6329285502433777

0,0,"three ? okay . well , um . it looks like we 've got got ourselves a pretty good product . um the functionality 's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting .",15,0.5,0.4780835509300232
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5544664859771729

1,0,mm-hmm . well then again if we 're gon na um do the speech recognition thing we 're gon there gon na be some buttons that are gon na have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech .,15,0.5,0.5597935318946838

'cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . so so , like i said , we had no insight in finances , no prices ,",15,0.5,0.5562669038772583

0,0,mm-hmm . i like the menu .,15,0.5,0.4779016673564911

1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5923591256141663
1,0,and it i guess it 's more easier to just paint it on the rubber,15,0.5,0.5109249949455261
1,0,"yeah , of course .",15,0.5,0.545491099357605

0,0,"finances , that 's what we have here , what you drew . we have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . the sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway . so which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts . so well , we have sin one curve , a design . rubber design . and we had a special colour . suppose yellow is a special colour . so just half a euro for you have pushbuttons and an l_c_d_ display . you have the total of seventeen euros in production cost ,",15,0.5,0.4974411129951477

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.1757928878068924
1,0,easy . what do we scrap . well think i had the best solution that i came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .,15,0.5,0.7562442421913147
0,0,i d,15,0.5,0.35536107420921326

1,0,"there are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . but ninety percent who favour an l_c_d_ display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . i think it 's also harder to",15,0.5,0.8088290095329285

1,0,"but we need those . so , generally what i came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half euros , spe scrap speech recognition",15,0.5,0.5410895943641663
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.4776684045791626
0,0,"special colour , yeah .",15,0.5,0.37958651781082153
1,0,"and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we 'll just then we 'll do it in black . we 'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it 's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers .",15,0.5,0.7145426273345947
0,0,"well ,",15,0.5,0.3468826115131378
0,0,you make it d orange or whatever you want .,15,0.5,0.47444939613342285
0,0,"i 'd i tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this .",15,0.5,0.4802588224411011
1,0,"it was a big issue , but",15,0.5,0.5160295367240906
0,0,so ca n't we just basically extend it to thirteen ?,15,0.5,0.39480656385421753
1,0,"i 'll just go back . uh let 's just let 's see what okay , let 's just see what we no , we we have to be under twelve and a half .",15,0.5,0.6181824207305908
0,0,"yeah , it",15,0.5,0.47024276852607727
1,0,it it 's not,15,0.5,0.5307977199554443
0,0,the p,15,0.5,0.465183824300766
1,0,"uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half ,",15,0.5,0.6827922463417053
0,0,"okay , but there 's another problem .",15,0.5,0.2686481773853302
1,0,and the p,15,0.5,0.6840296983718872
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.48536714911460876
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5841385722160339
0,0,but there 's another problem .,15,0.5,0.4317694306373596
1,0,what,15,0.5,0.5800760388374329
1,0,"if we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black does n't work obviously .",15,0.5,0.5711554884910583
0,0,"i think you that 's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together .",15,0.5,0.4468889534473419
1,0,huh . huh . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5015298128128052
1,0,"so i think yeah , it 's i think it 's y one of the it 's a good way to um to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too .",15,0.5,0.5930501222610474
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3161148726940155
1,0,"just keep you just make new covers for the for it ,",15,0.5,0.7598443031311035
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3055883049964905
1,0,like we agreed before .,15,0.5,0.6346358060836792
1,0,right . i agree .,15,0.5,0.5871226191520691
0,0,and everything that 's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . but we need that for the l_c_d_ display .,15,0.5,0.4664093852043152
1,0,yeah . we do .,15,0.5,0.5926322937011719
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5350039601325989
0,0,"then again , we have the l_c_d_ display , which is also expensive . b yeah , but those go together . and yeah , we could take out the curve .",15,0.5,0.4793463349342346
1,0,"or say let 's lose rubber , take plastic .",15,0.5,0.6200718283653259
0,0,we could take out a curve indeed .,15,0.5,0.382842481136322
0,0,could we could take out the curve . is that an option ?,15,0.5,0.4930083453655243
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5101256370544434
1,0,.,15,0.5,0.5864834785461426
1,0,for you ?,15,0.5,0.5756404399871826
0,0,although we are demolishing a little bit the style .,15,0.5,0.4591434597969055
1,0,but uh the and,15,0.5,0.6640204787254333
0,0,"i think the colour is more important than the really the curve ,",15,0.5,0.35766783356666565
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6637266874313354
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.4268709421157837
1,0,because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control,15,0.5,0.6537572145462036
0,0,"i think it 's it it does ruin it ,",15,0.5,0.27310416102409363
1,0,yeah . the people,15,0.5,0.6563722491264343
0,0,but the fact that i t took that decision or t,15,0.5,0.34185731410980225
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6151253581047058
0,0,"took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers . so you can change any colour you want . so it 's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want .",15,0.5,0.46502700448036194
1,0,can we then not also uh change the material ? we take plastic for the basic cover,15,0.5,0.5249086022377014
0,0,"you can take plastic ,",15,0.5,0.49219897389411926
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.46147361397743225
1,0,but i d it 's something that 's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the,15,0.5,0.5526595115661621
0,0,"spongy , yeah .",15,0.5,0.3803720474243164
1,0,we can put those to the to the other covers .,15,0.5,0.5918106436729431
1,0,"and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls ,",15,0.5,0.500954270362854
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3734193742275238
1,0,because they 're all plastic .,15,0.5,0.6181414127349854
0,0,and,15,0.5,0.4659462869167328
1,0,so which in in turn,15,0.5,0.589857280254364
1,0,that 's true .,15,0.5,0.6784354448318481
0,0,rubber would increase durability,15,0.5,0.4695119261741638
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.42271098494529724
0,0,because it does n't break .,15,0.5,0.4112928807735443
1,0,okay . but what do you then suggest we 'd lose ? because we have to lose two things and i guess .,15,0.5,0.5050410628318787
1,0,"i al like i said , i lost the speech recognition and i lost the special colour ,",15,0.5,0.5262234210968018
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.4844629168510437
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5304823517799377
1,0,which would make this black a black and grey .,15,0.5,0.5139015316963196
1,0,"okay , and that 's enough ?",15,0.5,0.5083115100860596
1,0,"yeah , that 's that that that 's enough , because",15,0.5,0.5854318141937256
1,0,so black and grey is okay .,15,0.5,0.53914874792099
0,0,i guess those are the basic colours .,15,0.5,0.4606262445449829
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.6062874794006348
1,0,so oh .,15,0.5,0.5278523564338684
1,0,"which we can fabricate ,",15,0.5,0.573899507522583
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.42478886246681213
1,0,i think those are basic col they want to,15,0.5,0.5676689743995667
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.44132140278816223
1,0,"the people want to pay for for it , so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ?",15,0.5,0.6775529384613037
0,0,to ensure the profit . that that 's th that 's the order . we 're just uh we 're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company,15,0.5,0.34635433554649353
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5459404587745667
1,0,which say we do n't wan na spend more than twelve fifty for this .,15,0.5,0.5315970182418823
0,0,but we can take a risk .,15,0.5,0.47457700967788696
0,0,but that 's not for our that 's not our decision to take . we have a budget of twelve fifty per product .,15,0.5,0.48777881264686584
0,0,"no , we basically",15,0.5,0.48601505160331726
1,0,"okay , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6122402548789978
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.44709140062332153
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.6375787258148193
1,0,we need to stick to that .,15,0.5,0.5993383526802063
0,0,stick that . i do n't think it 's really bad either . i mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing,15,0.5,0.4138234257698059
1,0,"i hope the people will like it ,",15,0.5,0.6749183535575867
0,0,to have,15,0.5,0.3991328179836273
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.49844270944595337
1,0,"i think they would do . th i think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea ,",15,0.5,0.6427302360534668
0,0,"because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want .",15,0.5,0.47320911288261414
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5367001295089722
1,0,so i think it 's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect,15,0.5,0.6436081528663635
0,0,perhaps we should make m,15,0.5,0.397960901260376
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5789034366607666
1,0,and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget .,15,0.5,0.5363441705703735
0,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.39112669229507446
0,0,the first sheet .,15,0.5,0.4863792359828949
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.47739845514297485
1,0,"perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . and that 's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that .",15,0.5,0.5189453959465027
1,0,well i do n't think yeah . is it worth is it is it,15,0.5,0.5047459602355957
1,0,perhaps they decide tha,15,0.5,0.607175350189209
0,0,but they do n't,15,0.5,0.4923732280731201
0,0,"does it mean anything to the customer ? like , it like , we do n't care we do n't care that you had to",15,0.5,0.4476855397224426
1,0,"of course . perhaps they uh no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let 's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs .",15,0.5,0.5828891396522522
0,0,"true ,",15,0.5,0.4374319612979889
1,0,we ca we uh we can at least tell them that,15,0.5,0.5283746123313904
1,0,but we did we did n't get that . so i think it 's,15,0.5,0.5266332626342773
0,0,you do n't know that .,15,0.5,0.45051833987236023
1,0,"it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something .",15,0.5,0.6212148666381836
0,0,well,15,0.5,0.419544517993927
1,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.5109131336212158
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.4435594081878662
1,0,"no , i 'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this . we could at least m uh make it like this , like you said ,",15,0.5,0.5623340606689453
1,0,"they could , but uh",15,0.5,0.5895232558250427
0,0,"and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . it is an still an option , but not for this price .",15,0.5,0.4611838757991791
0,0,"it 's an option , but yeah , it 's true . so actually uh it 's not that much of an increase , but yeah . we can not contact them .",15,0.5,0.41913750767707825
0,0,and if we,15,0.5,0.46998330950737
1,0,it 's just the order that we got .,15,0.5,0.5355998277664185
0,0,"exactly ,",15,0.5,0.46635422110557556
1,0,so that 's what we got ta go with .,15,0.5,0.538034200668335
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5069156289100647
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6106703281402588
0,0,"so it 's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it 's either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable ,",15,0.5,0.4683012068271637
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6974338889122009
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.478137731552124
1,0,um or turn it yellow . so it 's uh something we have to decide on .,15,0.5,0.6797522902488708
0,0,i 'd say lose the curve and the colour,15,0.5,0.3797597885131836
1,0,"i say lose the curve . oh that 's true ,",15,0.5,0.5003498792648315
1,0,and,15,0.5,0.5350573658943176
0,0,"we could lose the c i forgot that , yeah , sorry . uh the curve . so",15,0.5,0.4859122335910797
0,0,so which curve is that ba,15,0.5,0.4968678057193756
0,0,that 's just this one just d this is the banana curve .,15,0.5,0.4713374972343445
0,0,that 's basically that curve .,15,0.5,0.40484949946403503
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4525204300880432
1,0,so this would this would be straight .,15,0.5,0.6368540525436401
0,0,so we could u still have the comfort .,15,0.5,0.4984424114227295
0,0,"yeah , that 's better .",15,0.5,0.47262683510780334
1,0,"no , uh no , that would be a curve inside the thing , i guess . no , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . just like like that .",15,0.5,0.6395751237869263
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.32314828038215637
1,0,"which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . we could make it yellow then ,",15,0.5,0.6695578098297119
1,0,i second that .,15,0.5,0.506992518901825
0,0,"but you second that , you second that we lose the curve .",15,0.5,0.29394474625587463
1,0,"no , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control .",15,0.5,0.6208431720733643
0,0,"okay , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4026723802089691
1,0,so that 's not really that,15,0.5,0.5106839537620544
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5632559657096863
1,0,"so i think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak .",15,0.5,0.6270363330841064
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.48198968172073364
1,0,so we keep the curve . so the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber .,15,0.5,0.5835460424423218
1,0,i would,15,0.5,0.5907144546508789
0,0,"and i 'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has .",15,0.5,0.3506883382797241
1,0,oh . i agree .,15,0.5,0.6189612150192261
0,0,"yeah . i would say i would agree with you on the colour ,",15,0.5,0.44087305665016174
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.6631211638450623
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.41361138224601746
1,0,"because that 's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money .",15,0.5,0.650421679019928
1,0,"mm-hmm . yeah , um",15,0.5,0.5415616035461426
0,0,so we can always do that .,15,0.5,0.45237863063812256
1,0,i guess people are willing to pay for that . so i think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control .,15,0.5,0.6650312542915344
0,0,hmm ?,15,0.5,0.28335490822792053
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7233471870422363
0,0,so i think that would still make it a nice product .,15,0.5,0.48540645837783813
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5556342601776123
1,0,"okay , we 're final on that . so it 's too bad we ca n't make the whole super thing . but anyways we 're here . um yeah .",15,0.5,0.6790887117385864
1,0,which is basically what we discussed .,15,0.5,0.583009660243988
0,0,"this we discussed just now . that 's just now just we could just discuss how the project went . i mean , was kind of",15,0.5,0.47503507137298584
0,0,and i want to do that .,15,0.5,0.3874959945678711
1,0,"i sort of expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you yeah , everything can not be for free . we did n't i think it was too bad we did n't have the financial info the last time . because that was i th",15,0.5,0.6276389956474304
1,0,"yes ,",15,0.5,0.5035909414291382
1,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.5686064958572388
0,0,it was really essential really,15,0.5,0.4757447838783264
1,0,we could have,15,0.5,0.5068320631980896
1,0,to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost .,15,0.5,0.5712948441505432
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4304240942001343

1,0,i think it 's really nor not in stroke with reality actually .,15,0.5,0.5572449564933777
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5376015305519104
0,0,"me too , i felt a bit blind throughout the project ,",15,0.5,0.4243825078010559
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6344667077064514
0,0,"because in the beginning i had no list of available materials ,",15,0.5,0.45847195386886597
1,0,"yeah , i think would have been .",15,0.5,0.5480058789253235
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5835333466529846
1,0,materials would be ok,15,0.5,0.5663193464279175
0,0,and then i d had not list of available c finances .,15,0.5,0.38395971059799194
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.622160017490387
1,0,at least the last meeting i would have expected had to have that .,15,0.5,0.5146564841270447
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5510872006416321
1,0,so i suppose,15,0.5,0.5281520485877991
1,0,let 's um see um,15,0.5,0.5010576248168945
1,0,"yeah , let 's see if it sells . i mean i suppose this sells , because it 's very very extended .",15,0.5,0.639909029006958
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.5442313551902771
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5532898902893066
1,0,well i hope it sells .,15,0.5,0.5241050124168396
1,0,let 's uh,15,0.5,0.5351802706718445
1,0,"i suppose it sells ,",15,0.5,0.5841588973999023
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.42414817214012146
1,0,because it 's good .,15,0.5,0.6123614311218262
1,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.5688905715942383
1,0,"i mean it 's got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we did n't know what it 's gon na cost anyway .",15,0.5,0.536400556564331
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3689175546169281
1,1,okay . good afternoon again .,15,0.5,0.5719842910766602
1,0,"so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . um so here is the agenda for today . uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we 'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we 'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh euro . okay . so let 's go . uh if i go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through th uh w we took this following decisions . no l_c_d_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . we went through the use of wheels and but buttons . and also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . okay . um . good . so guys let this uh wonderful thing .",15,0.5,0.5128621459007263
1,0,okay so we can go to the slides .,15,0.5,0.5384353399276733
1,0,oh yeah . sorry . um .,15,0.5,0.5066090822219849
1,0,yeah . number three . oh number two sorry .,15,0.5,0.6208751797676086
1,0,which is,15,0.5,0.514999508857727
1,0,so final design . final design . okay so michael you can go ahead .,15,0.5,0.5841948390007019
1,0,yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow well to make a banana,15,0.5,0.5364067554473877
1,0,yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe .,15,0.5,0.5282992124557495
1,0,remote okay so we actually have a,15,0.5,0.5701629519462585
1,0,"you can pull it out first , maybe .",15,0.5,0.6289851665496826
1,0,we 've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh,15,0.5,0.5251851081848145
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5738512873649597
1,0,"bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it 's not gon na tip over and um this is the remote itself , it 's kind of it 's it 's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . we 've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally .",15,0.5,0.5388793349266052
0,0,what 's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?,15,0.5,0.4414479732513428
1,0,this is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th,15,0.5,0.5392234325408936
0,0,ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops .,15,0.5,0.4544064700603485
1,0,yeah . well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . but normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture .,15,0.5,0.5981078147888184
1,0,uh,15,0.5,0.5050300359725952
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.6683104038238525
0,0,"and we we do have one more functionality . if you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the t_v_ .",15,0.5,0.40642157196998596
0,0,the t_v_ yeah .,15,0.5,0.4877704679965973
1,0,which one ?,15,0.5,0.5251087546348572
0,0,the s the turbo button .,15,0.5,0.4019986689090729
0,0,the turbo button .,15,0.5,0.33118048310279846
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.593753457069397
0,0,so rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button .,15,0.5,0.38971248269081116
0,0,additional button .,15,0.5,0.4572353661060333
0,0,what this button for ?,15,0.5,0.4455851912498474
0,0,this is a teletext button . so once you press that then you get teletext,15,0.5,0.37075933814048767
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.7010350227355957
0,0,and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh,15,0.5,0.4724886119365692
0,0,to navigate it through th through teletext .,15,0.5,0.4302227199077606
1,0,to navigate yeah .,15,0.5,0.5287033915519714
1,0,but if you want to go to page seven hundred ?,15,0.5,0.55389803647995
1,0,"that 's right , that 's right .",15,0.5,0.5075213313102722
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7168160080909729
1,0,with the wheel it 's easy .,15,0.5,0.6492411494255066
0,0,how man,15,0.5,0.40630048513412476
0,0,"well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing , you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh",15,0.5,0.445732444524765
1,0,i do n't understand it . can you repeat it ?,15,0.5,0.5288519859313965
0,0,well you can you can press press the teletext button,15,0.5,0.41139551997184753
1,0,and then you then you can you can f,15,0.5,0.6428254246711731
0,0,so then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing .,15,0.5,0.3718721866607666
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6092716455459595

1,0,mm uh,15,0.5,0.5729529857635498
0,0,"once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .",15,0.5,0.38498854637145996
1,0,okay . i see . i see . okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5465304851531982
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5769908428192139
1,0,and this is the uh the infrared uh port .,15,0.5,0.5658960342407227
1,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.6692629456520081
0,0,also the top of the banana .,15,0.5,0.4450918734073639
0,0,excellent .,15,0.5,0.43203797936439514
1,0,so . and then we have,15,0.5,0.5283693671226501
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5774957537651062
1,0,in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana .,15,0.5,0.5818793177604675
0,0,calling . excellent .,15,0.5,0.3454635441303253
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7697972059249878
0,0,and the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?,15,0.5,0.49186503887176514
0,0,actually they do .,15,0.5,0.3876335024833679
1,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.5667425394058228
0,0,that 's that 's yeah that 's uh that 's form and function in the one in the one uh object .,15,0.5,0.46358656883239746
1,0,"yeah . so it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage .",15,0.5,0.6327985525131226
0,0,it 's like antennas .,15,0.5,0.45662829279899597
0,0,yeah . so .,15,0.5,0.4520382881164551
1,0,but yeah that 's um that 's just like that 's an attractive um base station .,15,0.5,0.6207767128944397
0,0,great .,15,0.5,0.4986589252948761
1,0,so .,15,0.5,0.5287995338439941
0,0,"so , what else ?",15,0.5,0.45643752813339233
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4331929385662079
1,0,and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries .,15,0.5,0.6604024767875671
0,0,is it really weight ? is it light or,15,0.5,0.3596872091293335
0,0,it is very light .,15,0.5,0.49808469414711
1,0,"yeah , they 're light .",15,0.5,0.6992910504341125
0,0,it 's it 's uh it 's about the weight of a banana .,15,0.5,0.4511566460132599
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.43025439977645874
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6756830215454102

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4993002712726593
1,0,ok,15,0.5,0.6044111847877502
0,0,and we have put these different colours so that people do n't mistake them mistake it as a banana .,15,0.5,0.40397948026657104
1,0,otherwise it 's you know a child comes and so,15,0.5,0.5476430654525757
0,0,"okay . yeah yeah yeah , i see . i under i understand .",15,0.5,0.35354647040367126
1,0,"i think a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should",15,0.5,0.6270883083343506
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.60077303647995
1,0,consider that . maybe health and safety aspects .,15,0.5,0.5097723603248596
0,0,ah yeah .,15,0.5,0.4100699722766876

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.45795994997024536
1,0,"so for the power source , apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries .",15,0.5,0.6759386658668518
0,0,oh yeah that 's right .,15,0.5,0.34340590238571167
0,0,uh you mean okay . so,15,0.5,0.4854711890220642
1,0,i do n't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station .,15,0.5,0.6168704032897949
0,0,"yeah , where are going to where are you are you going to place them ?",15,0.5,0.489277720451355
1,0,mm-hmm mm-hmm . it 'll it 'll be always at top somewhere at there .,15,0.5,0.6140003800392151
0,0,if i was gon na place them i 'd put them on the on the top here since that 's like uh the black bit,15,0.5,0.3705872893333435
1,0,you have enough surface ? you,15,0.5,0.5476782917976379
0,0,but yeah i do n't i really do n't think it 's necessary to have the solar cells anymore .,15,0.5,0.48908182978630066
0,0,yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries,15,0.5,0.4259108006954193
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.47886183857917786
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.42135271430015564
1,0,so that that is .,15,0.5,0.555267870426178
0,0,what will be the autonomy ? roughly ?,15,0.5,0.4856208264827728
1,0,the what sorry ?,15,0.5,0.5874767303466797
1,0,the autonomy . autonomy .,15,0.5,0.5093991756439209
1,0,what do you mean ?,15,0.5,0.5002362132072449
1,0,uh i mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?,15,0.5,0.5337228178977966
1,0,how long the how long the bit the batteries long .,15,0.5,0.5201606750488281
1,0,ah . ah . a long time .,15,0.5,0.5265561938285828
1,0,yeah . a long,15,0.5,0.539053201675415
1,0,"no no no ,",15,0.5,0.5597192049026489
0,0,eight to ten eight to ten hours .,15,0.5,0.4267161190509796
1,0,it can it should be weeks .,15,0.5,0.6765508055686951
0,0,n most no most of the time it 's not being used .,15,0.5,0.4076482355594635
0,0,"yeah , so it 's",15,0.5,0.4177018702030182
1,0,yeah but y people do n't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wan na leave it on the couch so,15,0.5,0.6590594053268433
0,0,so when when you are making it on,15,0.5,0.39400044083595276
1,0,it 's used only when you,15,0.5,0.562842845916748
0,0,mm . mm-hmm . no eight or eight or ten hours of working .,15,0.5,0.4159095287322998
1,0,"ah , okay .",15,0.5,0.5196162462234497
0,0,if you are just leaving like that it 'll be much longer .,15,0.5,0.48066627979278564
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.2835940718650818
1,0,yeah . f weeks .,15,0.5,0.60773104429245
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4260849058628082
1,0,yeah . that 's right .,15,0.5,0.5859485864639282
1,0,right . next slide ?,15,0.5,0.6437249183654785
0,0,yeah . and we are having the speakers regular chip for control . pricing is was a factor so that 's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . and uh that 's it .,15,0.5,0.48010265827178955
1,0,okay . okay . those really sounds very good .,15,0.5,0.532670795917511
1,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.5119718909263611
1,0,nothing else to add ?,15,0.5,0.5763006806373596
0,0,it seems to be falling over .,15,0.5,0.4742113947868347
1,0,i l yeah .,15,0.5,0.5523085594177246
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6071833968162537
0,0,i like i like it . maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons . looks a bit,15,0.5,0.4711954593658447
0,0,you want to have more functional buttons ?,15,0.5,0.49210914969444275
0,0,looks a bit puzzled uh i dunno how to say that .,15,0.5,0.4925352931022644
1,0,you are not convinced .,15,0.5,0.6968582272529602
0,0,you the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it 's teletext or not,15,0.5,0.48085203766822815
0,0,"not not many , we we want to keep it simple . so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons .",15,0.5,0.39289212226867676
1,0,and the volume button will will become,15,0.5,0.6215564012527466
1,0,"it 's up to you , means .",15,0.5,0.5095956921577454
0,0,"well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext .",15,0.5,0.43225765228271484
1,0,now that means let 's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .,15,0.5,0.5957006812095642
0,0,or can move between positions in the in the number .,15,0.5,0.49343952536582947

1,0,yeah . so there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .,15,0.5,0.5156667828559875
0,0,"so we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they do n't care about the buttons any more . and anyway",15,0.5,0.36058947443962097
1,0,okay . because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ?,15,0.5,0.535950779914856
0,0,it 's all automatic .,15,0.5,0.38609686493873596
1,0,it 's all automatic .,15,0.5,0.5721520185470581

0,0,bananas everywhere .,15,0.5,0.42587167024612427
0,0,"okay , so",15,0.5,0.3549618124961853
1,0,automatically configure .,15,0.5,0.6751497983932495
0,0,so we have to go through now evaluations .,15,0.5,0.2836848199367523
1,0,evalua yeah .,15,0.5,0.6603078842163086

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5813970565795898
1,0,okay . i i const i constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . and each criteria is will be evaluated it 's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it 's true or is or if it 's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven .,15,0.5,0.5735307335853577
1,0,why this strange factor of seven ?,15,0.5,0.605861246585846
0,0,because i i 'm sorry . sorry .,15,0.5,0.34688475728034973
1,0,usually i have seen that scales are from one to ten .,15,0.5,0.5338488221168518
0,0,"ah yeah . it 's from sorry , it 's from one to seven . it 's from from one to seven sorry . because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale ,",15,0.5,0.4314228892326355
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.48216843605041504
0,0,num number,15,0.5,0.4650259017944336
1,0,okay . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6080948710441589
0,0,and five is too short and nine is too long .,15,0.5,0.4618026316165924
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5354463458061218

1,0,"okay fine , got the idea .",15,0.5,0.5778586268424988
1,0,so to have in order to have enough granularity,15,0.5,0.5089898705482483
1,0,sorry ?,15,0.5,0.6181591749191284
0,0,it 's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation .,15,0.5,0.42906463146209717
1,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.585000216960907
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5728151798248291

1,0,go ahead .,15,0.5,0.5662344694137573
0,0,and that 's the criteria i i found more useful . i think i sh i i could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?,15,0.5,0.39767247438430786
1,0,mm-hmm . sure .,15,0.5,0.6416851878166199

1,0,okay . yeah yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5944100618362427

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.537298858165741
1,0,"so you can say fancy , handy . handy .",15,0.5,0.5341876745223999

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5365403890609741
1,0,it 's quite fancy .,15,0.5,0.5345290303230286
0,0,so you can add seven plus six plus seven plus,15,0.5,0.45576855540275574
1,0,"no , wait .",15,0.5,0.5093193650245667

1,0,again i 'll give seven .,15,0.5,0.5278126001358032
1,0,seven .,15,0.5,0.6198848485946655
1,0,"i 'd give it a six like i 'd i think it 's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels",15,0.5,0.5373958349227905
0,0,six .,15,0.5,0.432593435049057
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.33562734723091125
1,0,but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote .,15,0.5,0.6880309581756592
0,0,"so seven , seven ,",15,0.5,0.4296916127204895

1,0,four .,15,0.5,0.5274056792259216
1,0,i would say,15,0.5,0.5277460217475891
0,0,"well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ?",15,0.5,0.47217562794685364
1,0,everything ar,15,0.5,0.537117600440979
1,0,"uh for a remote control , does he have all the",15,0.5,0.5745083689689636
0,0,you know .,15,0.5,0.4257441759109497

0,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.4049984812736511
1,0,remote controls .,15,0.5,0.5975170731544495
1,0,that 's before,15,0.5,0.5202590227127075

0,0,well it 's not a universal remote . remember we 're focus we 're supposed to focus just on t_v_s .,15,0.5,0.4014202356338501
1,0,we,15,0.5,0.6120911240577698

0,0,there i 'll give it seven .,15,0.5,0.4262876510620117
1,0,"it means cool features , like new features actually .",15,0.5,0.6495206952095032
0,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.37209147214889526
0,0,which,15,0.5,0.48377689719200134
1,0,for a t_v_ the most important feature which i felt was the locator which is a cool feature . and then the scroll buttons are again cool features . we do n't have l_c_d_ for it but that we decided we do n't want to have .,15,0.5,0.5656774044036865
0,0,yeah . seven .,15,0.5,0.39384815096855164

0,1,"should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include ,",15,0.5,0.4698694944381714
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5331222414970398
1,0,"'cause we 've thrown a lot of features onto the table , but do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ?",15,0.5,0.6689276695251465
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.36141929030418396

0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.43652161955833435
1,0,and you 're supposed to keep watching the trends . um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . i think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now,15,0.5,0.5753211975097656
1,0,i thought,15,0.5,0.5388662219047546
1,0,"and eliminate them later in the process , that 's my suggestion .",15,0.5,0.5480243563652039

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.43762099742889404
1,0,"yes , now i 'm objecting . no , i mean , i was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we 're just gon na end up throwing away ? i mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we 're not gon na use , maybe it 's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , but",15,0.5,0.698257565498352
0,0,"i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting ,",15,0.5,0.3214358687400818
1,0,oh th we s we still have,15,0.5,0.5365690588951111

1,0,"excellent . right . hopefully that 's us ready to uh to go . so . functional design meeting . we 'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . um we 'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . not a lot thankfully to say . we introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the t_v_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . um it 's come to my attention the following . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . remote control should only be used for the t_v_ . um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . um . now . just to say quickly uh i would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required .",15,0.5,0.5559445023536682

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4286474883556366
1,0,"okay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . we asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there 's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group .",15,0.5,0.5677061676979065
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.3135978877544403
1,0,"okay . so we got some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . i often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it 's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . i remember trying to load a d_v_d_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me i do n't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there 's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . and if they do , not very often . takes too long to master the remote control . i 've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they 're just not great to use . we just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . some of the good stuff we got . between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . now do n't get excited yet , i 've got more to say on that . most people 'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . finally , my opinion .",15,0.5,0.658068060874939
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.19598717987537384
1,0,"the voice recognition thing is cool . and uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . it 's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you 're not gon na get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you ca n't have that many words . for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . i 'm pretty sure people would buy it . but after a while people may wan na return it , because if you have to to say som i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that 's for flickering through channels . so if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . however , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there 's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . but if we do have the voice recognition thing , there 's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . see , you could there 're two options . either you have voice recognition by itself , which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wan na be watching television and you wan na be quiet , or i do n't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote 's only trained for you , it 's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . as long as the voice recognition stuff works , that 's that 's fine .",15,0.5,0.7400991320610046
0,0,"okay , yep .",15,0.5,0.21891789138317108
1,0,"so we have the three birds , we have the design , that we have the the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition 's fancy , it 's cool , it 's different , it 's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit i do n't remember so i 'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , i think is a big question . um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it 'll take to train the remote , 'cause i think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . and uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wan na use the t_v_ , they ca n't use the remote because they speak differently to you . um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . uh , will people return the remote control , i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so ,",15,0.5,0.7361951470375061

0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.41598182916641235
0,0,okay . hmm .,15,0.5,0.4927862584590912
1,0,uh uh to me in a marketing sense it 's not it 's not relative . we can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it .,15,0.5,0.6111804842948914
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.4650839865207672
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6437122225761414
1,0,"and what we may be able to do , and i think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these . um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i i think it feels a little better than the plastic .",15,0.5,0.5594106912612915
1,0,'kay . do you get a good grip on the rubber ? yeah okay .,15,0.5,0.5487391948699951
1,0,yeah um,15,0.5,0.614298403263092
0,0,"and if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand .",15,0.5,0.4966835081577301
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5469738245010376
1,0,you do n't even need to lean down to get it .,15,0.5,0.5555084943771362
1,0,the advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we 'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape,15,0.5,0.5907334685325623
0,0,because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . so um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um,15,0.5,0.4082493484020233
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5509209632873535
0,0,"but basically these are curved and double-curved i i believe that the tech department , in their um in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . i have no idea exactly what they 're talking about ,",15,0.5,0.4973812997341156
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.49042582511901855
1,0,"but that 's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved .",15,0.5,0.5920611619949341
0,0,"i would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it 's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? i think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes",15,0.5,0.46788349747657776
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.43979349732398987
1,0,or surfaces . i have no idea .,15,0.5,0.5180622935295105
0,0,i think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a,15,0.5,0.4597814679145813
1,0,mm-hmm yeah that 's yeah that 's what i see .,15,0.5,0.5337056517601013
1,0,yeah that 's what .,15,0.5,0.5881047248840332
1,0,"oh okay oh like a wave , okay .",15,0.5,0.5367453098297119
1,0,yeah that 's what i see also .,15,0.5,0.659188985824585
0,0,"alright that makes sense okay . um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and l_c_d_ display ,",15,0.5,0.44023457169532776
1,0,ooh .,15,0.5,0.701826274394989
0,0,or multiple scrolling wheels . um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface .,15,0.5,0.3976239562034607
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5063775181770325
0,0,"for electronics , we have these very technical um descriptions here . a simple chip , which is the least expensive , but i have no numbers to give you ,",15,0.5,0.47898828983306885
1,0,"a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh",15,0.5,0.6117931008338928
1,0,d do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ?,15,0.5,0.5141094326972961
0,0,"yes the difference is , with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why does n't this scroll up ? previous previous , okay . a simple chip is required to operate push buttons .",15,0.5,0.3584667444229126
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.7227843999862671
0,0,"um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the l_c_d_ display , and it did n't say specifically , but i i have a hunch that a regular chip is gon na be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels .",15,0.5,0.3885318636894226
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4983885586261749
1,0,so but yeah .,15,0.5,0.5678154826164246
1,0,yeah that makes sense . so presentation from i guess design would go best . next .,15,0.5,0.6172470450401306
1,0,that 's the end of my presentation .,15,0.5,0.6337915658950806
1,0,technical functions or interface concept ?,15,0.5,0.5257741808891296
0,0,i think,15,0.5,0.4934195578098297
0,0,oh interface concept .,15,0.5,0.482713907957077
1,0,yeah that 's it .,15,0.5,0.6217274069786072
1,0,very long presentation .,15,0.5,0.5201845169067383
0,0,"yes , but it has your name on it .",15,0.5,0.472589373588562
1,0,"well that does n't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . um so , somehow that thing 's too big , but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . they say they could put it to work but um we do n't think so .",15,0.5,0.612281084060669
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.3037603199481964
1,0,no . it it it you 'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and,15,0.5,0.5984469056129456
0,0,"if the t_v_ is working , yeah .",15,0.5,0.44395655393600464
1,0,"that 's just i mean it 'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it 's gon na change the channel .",15,0.5,0.5176472067832947
1,0,"yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore ,",15,0.5,0.6125181913375854
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.3622879087924957
1,0,and i think that 's one of the things we wan na keep .,15,0.5,0.6313230991363525
0,0,"but what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? so if you pressed it and went , up ?",15,0.5,0.2812202274799347
1,0,that kinda would r d,15,0.5,0.5910079479217529
0,0,well then why do n't you just press the up button ?,15,0.5,0.4806368052959442
1,0,man yeah .,15,0.5,0.5887244939804077
0,0,yeah . that would kind of lose it .,15,0.5,0.46521973609924316
1,0,but if it 's just one thing with a button that you can just go up .,15,0.5,0.6201616525650024
0,0,even still there 's gon na be interf th there 's there still will be interference from the t_v_ .,15,0.5,0.44654762744903564
0,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.4984104037284851
1,0,"yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.5797290205955505
1,0,"it might not be it might not be completely confusing , but i think you 'll still y it 's still",15,0.5,0.5236929655075073
0,0,i do n't think it 's practical at all . i think it 's a bad idea frankly .,15,0.5,0.48855987191200256
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5600149035453796
0,0,"yeah so um taking that away , our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable",15,0.5,0.39994314312934875
1,0,you guys know your stuff .,15,0.5,0.5208864808082581
1,0,"it 's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . um as for the point that we making about losing it . well , we wan na small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost ,",15,0.5,0.5015838742256165
0,0,that i would believe .,15,0.5,0.41301971673965454
1,0,about,15,0.5,0.5281733274459839
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5334232449531555
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3809428811073303
1,0,"but um yeah i think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we 'll do that . somehow . um so the the what i would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial .",15,0.5,0.5981740951538086
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4841078519821167
1,0,and um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext .,15,0.5,0.6269959807395935
0,0,so we 're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ?,15,0.5,0.477742075920105
1,0,ye no it 's not,15,0.5,0.6390258073806763
0,0,that 's not a scroll wheel .,15,0.5,0.4738618731498718
0,0,"i i it 's just four buttons that are on a cross ,",15,0.5,0.2572685480117798
1,0,nah . oh okay okay . i see .,15,0.5,0.6926817893981934
0,0,so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone .,15,0.5,0.48832592368125916
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.40647950768470764
1,0,"uh , okay .",15,0.5,0.5833520293235779
0,0,"instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that 's up , down , louder , and quieter .",15,0.5,0.4782262444496155
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5639944672584534
1,0,"yeah um yeah so i think we w we go for something mid-sized , so something looks good",15,0.5,0.5976911187171936
1,0,and uh is not too prone to get lost . that be it .,15,0.5,0.534233033657074
1,0,'kay . so on to y functional requirements or trend watching ?,15,0.5,0.505606472492218
0,0,i dunno .,15,0.5,0.49450793862342834
0,0,trend watching has a later date there .,15,0.5,0.46201878786087036
0,0,trend watching i guess . trend watching i believe .,15,0.5,0.48787492513656616
0,0,forty six nineteen fifty seven . yep .,15,0.5,0.40800467133522034
1,0,see what it looks like . it 's been so long .,15,0.5,0.5655795335769653
1,0,.,15,0.5,0.5741623640060425
0,0,well i do n't know what to say . when i s when i see the when i see the product i i i i do n't wan na buy it . i see so many of 'em out there . there 's nothing about that product that makes me wan na choose that product over other products that are out there .,15,0.5,0.3894249498844147
1,0,"are you talking about the picture ? that 's not our that 's not our b design ,",15,0.5,0.6283750534057617
1,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.5937085747718811
0,0,that 's just a that 's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like .,15,0.5,0.4090648591518402
1,0,okay . okay . okay 'cause 'cause right now i do n't have too much to say about how to market this product because we do n't have a product to market yet .,15,0.5,0.5194144248962402
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.47482532262802124
1,0,"and uh from from talking to mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now . that 's what i understand so ,",15,0.5,0.5350301861763
1,0,upper management said yes .,15,0.5,0.5377352237701416
1,0,hello .,15,0.5,0.509730875492096
0,0,"uh e excuse that , that 's a bit of spam .",15,0.5,0.47213301062583923
1,0,and and so yeah i 'm a i 'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that i 'm gon na market ? uh without special or increased marketable features i do n't believe the product has a consumer demand . uh i like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price right now . what are we gon na do to make this one special and unique ?,15,0.5,0.728218138217926
0,0,what 's special and unique about a scroll ?,15,0.5,0.4189591705799103
0,0,uh well i do n't,15,0.5,0.4443933963775635
1,0,it 's cool .,15,0.5,0.6064448356628418
1,0,"yeah it 's i i just see it as different . i do n't say it 's specially mm i do n't say it 's special . uh i say that it 's different i what i 'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . i give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , do n't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it 's f at the same price . i need something to market about this thing . we 're we 're a new firm .",15,0.5,0.5877410173416138
0,0,"i 'd i 'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well ,",15,0.5,0.42207708954811096
1,0,what i if when when we have,15,0.5,0.5502516031265259
0,0,but wi with a similar,15,0.5,0.4962908625602722
1,0,"yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that 's as as a marketing standard i need something to market , to make this product unique .",15,0.5,0.5766429901123047
1,0,"well right i think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior ,",15,0.5,0.5788185000419617
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4728129208087921
1,0,having it look really nice um and also be really durable .,15,0.5,0.6435166001319885
0,0,mm 'kay . just remember when i made up this report i did n't have the information that we 're discussing here .,15,0.5,0.4362385869026184
0,0,mm . course .,15,0.5,0.4983483552932739
1,0,right yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6380593180656433
1,0,"and and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what i 'm saying is , from my perspective , i do n't have a product to market right now . um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . that 's that is the next step , there 's technology and then there is technology , which we 're moving into the next phase .",15,0.5,0.5194929242134094
1,0,yeah 'cause that 's .,15,0.5,0.6811177134513855
1,0,and so uh we 're gon na have some new technology to enhance the marketability . yeah uh again i 'm not sold on the product because we do n't have a product in my opinion yet .,15,0.5,0.5183179974555969
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.35081812739372253
0,0,so i need a product .,15,0.5,0.4572860896587372
1,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.5709234476089478
0,0,well let 's get a product then .,15,0.5,0.43919476866722107
1,0,"i need a product to market . and i just whatever product you guys put together , we 'll find a way to market it . tha that i 'm not concerned with .",15,0.5,0.6148602366447449
1,0,so now,15,0.5,0.5689283013343811
1,0,if you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then i need to i need to find a lower cost .,15,0.5,0.5370979309082031
1,0,so our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? do we go basic or do we go for features ? uh d does anyone really wan na do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ?,15,0.5,0.6209943890571594
0,0,"well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? function-wise , what does that do that",15,0.5,0.4864861071109772
0,0,oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ?,15,0.5,0.4260934889316559
0,0,yeah wh wh what 's the wh,15,0.5,0.4833061397075653
1,0,yeah . well it 's it 's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .,15,0.5,0.5543622374534607
0,0,mm 'kay,15,0.5,0.3593657314777374
1,0,but would we,15,0.5,0.5956359505653381
0,0,okay now what i see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . so from a marketing standpoint i have i have another door to walk through when we have something that 's unique .,15,0.5,0.4631933867931366
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4899660050868988
1,0,"if it creates something more complex or more expensive , then i do n't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . but again , from a marketing perspective i want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we 're we 're co it 's a very competitive market .",15,0.5,0.7530205845832825
0,0,what i understand about scroll wheels is they 're they 're quite expensive to to make .,15,0.5,0.42549896240234375
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4730146527290344
1,0,so i d,15,0.5,0.6270717978477478
1,0,"th they are gon na be more expensive , but on the other hand , i mean , it i mean it is an alternative if if you think that 's gon na sell some some uh you know if if we 're gon na make up the extra cost by extra sales i think maybe it 's worth it to do it , but i mean i would just use if i was gon na do this i would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . i do n't think volume or do you think volume would be",15,0.5,0.548511803150177
1,0,i dunno . i 'll bet first in volume maybe . i dunno .,15,0.5,0.7222158908843994
1,0,no we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but,15,0.5,0.5260854363441467
0,0,"well i d i like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh dock to put it in to to charge it . we can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things .",15,0.5,0.4474897086620331
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4427286386489868
1,0,"it s i m makes it easy to market ,",15,0.5,0.5245278477668762
1,0,yeah yeah .,15,0.5,0.5867881178855896
1,0,"it 's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so .",15,0.5,0.5272318720817566
1,0,i think it 's that 's right . i think so .,15,0.5,0.7148582935333252
1,0,and if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product 's gon na need to be more durable th thus because you 're not going to be ditching it as often .,15,0.5,0.5198994278907776
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5161113142967224
1,0,it 's gon na need to be more expensive because of the cradle .,15,0.5,0.5316292643547058
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.37788236141204834
1,0,so if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well,15,0.5,0.6597967743873596
0,0,"yep . i think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now ,",15,0.5,0.4797403812408447
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7395728826522827
1,0,and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it 's own demand from it 's uniqueness .,15,0.5,0.6255527138710022
0,0,"so our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh what type of casing ? i personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber .",15,0.5,0.48452821373939514
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5726621747016907
0,0,"i 'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , where there 's you have plastic bits and then it 's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside .",15,0.5,0.43407055735588074
1,0,"okay . just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for",15,0.5,0.6166138052940369
1,0,"well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens i think are are kind of",15,0.5,0.5074781179428101
1,0,"okay . so then if we d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons , or do we want if we 're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go l_c_d_ ? do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ?",15,0.5,0.5622247457504272
0,0,it 's only a t_v_ .,15,0.5,0.4455920457839966
1,0,"or from from my perspective i think l_c_d_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you 're doing i mean it 's you 're not gon na get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there 's just not a lot of information , you know , there .",15,0.5,0.5387138724327087
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4405463933944702
1,0,it receives no information .,15,0.5,0.615123987197876
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.36619848012924194
1,0,so i i do n't see any reason for having an l_c_d_ 'cause it 's an increased cost . unless you can think of something interesting to do with it .,15,0.5,0.7060902714729309
1,0,"yeah . yeah right now there 's right now there 's nothing coming out of the t_v_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there 's no s i do n't see the ,",15,0.5,0.5084959864616394
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5276896953582764
1,0,i do n't see the necessity of an l_c_d_ either . do n't see it .,15,0.5,0.5041646361351013
1,0,okay so the question is now i guess we need t to decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing .,15,0.5,0.5701329112052917
0,0,"so , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ?",15,0.5,0.4956565797328949
1,0,what what overall things have we not decided on ?,15,0.5,0.7047946453094482
0,0,"well we have to i think for me it 's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gon na be . there 's the scroll wheel , in or out ? what do you guys like in the user interface ?",15,0.5,0.327013224363327
1,0,"i think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gon na make enough of a difference to justify the cost ?",15,0.5,0.5138524770736694
1,0,"again . well i think it 's it 's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , i believe , for me to market . uh again the push-buttons i i see are are everywhere . and so we can go with the same thing , but we 're gon na be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . you know the other thing i thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? make a remote that does n't look like a remote . it 's just another it 's just a an idea , and i do n't know",15,0.5,0.5807846188545227
0,0,"well i dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because i think , as far as durability th it 's not a big well maybe when it 's closed .",15,0.5,0.4372233748435974
1,0,"i mean what i see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff .",15,0.5,0.6157411336898804
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.40095531940460205
1,0,this,15,0.5,0.528245210647583
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5431067943572998
1,0,and what i keep throwing out there i just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different .,15,0.5,0.5679612755775452
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5537130236625671
1,0,but you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost .,15,0.5,0.5542868971824646
0,0,"yeah and i guess th th the question th th that you 're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ?",15,0.5,0.4004087448120117
1,0,oh okay,15,0.5,0.5704777240753174
1,0,because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost .,15,0.5,0.5135326981544495
0,0,phew .,15,0.5,0.4100005626678467
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5145228505134583
1,0,"i think you got ta g get into cost effectiveness . i think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , i think those are two very strong features ,",15,0.5,0.6298503279685974
0,0,well,15,0.5,0.37964120507240295
1,0,if that 's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost .,15,0.5,0.6446433663368225
0,0,"the the locator 's gon na require a radio transmitter , which will",15,0.5,0.3534483313560486
0,1,okay .,15,0.5,0.48066312074661255

0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.488066166639328
1,0,and we can start meeting .,15,0.5,0.5561693906784058
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6380010843276978
0,0,what 's the agenda for this meeting ?,15,0.5,0.49378108978271484

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6036614775657654
1,0,and well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the,15,0.5,0.509346604347229
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.41555148363113403

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5238848924636841
1,0,"the customers , indeed yes . think that 's that 's important matter .",15,0.5,0.5040715336799622
1,0,that 's the big question yeah .,15,0.5,0.5974261164665222

0,0,good luck .,15,0.5,0.4951731860637665
1,0,"doh . 'kay i 'm uh gon na inform you about the trend-watching i 've done over the past few days . um we 've done some market research . we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . and um besides that um i deployed some trend-watchers to milan and paris to well get all of the newest trends . and i 've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . um okay these are some overall findings . um most important thing is the fancy design . um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . by innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . um for our um group , we 're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'kay these are some more group specific findings . uh the older people prefer dark colours . uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . um this leads us to some personal preferences . uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . just keep it simple and well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . so this would be very important that we at least include these features . um well the trend-watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . so you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . so they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . so it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . the wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . people with more money . uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . that would be all .",15,0.5,0.6124826669692993
0,0,okay . thank you . any questions about the the trends ?,15,0.5,0.40868279337882996

0,0,mm no .,15,0.5,0.3815814256668091
1,0,"no ? okay , we go on to the next one .",15,0.5,0.5300345420837402
1,0,"um 'kay um yeah . uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . so uh um uh that 's w what i what i want to uh uh to do in uh our design . so um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . um the uh i found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . so maybe uh we can uh use uh that . um uh and uh using a little uh display . so um findings . um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . so uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . um uh let 's see . um yeah and uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . so uh it 's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . um and yeah overall um user-friendly . so uh using uh large large buttons . um it 's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . so uh uh yeah . and and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or a and uh yeah . television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . um let 's see . uh yeah . i was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who ca n't uh read small uh subtitles . so uh um yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we 've got um the buttons we have to use . the on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . and um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . so um made a little uh picture of uh it . um see . um yeah . just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button .",15,0.5,0.5383852124214172
0,0,"so um d display uh of it , it 's uh just a small display . uh um you can put it uh on top . um it 's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of looks at . so uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it 's uh on place where um the thumb of of the so you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . um it 's uh quite uh handy place . so um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh i think uh so uh the form of it so",15,0.5,0.4344389736652374
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5436282753944397
1,0,and that 's it .,15,0.5,0.6672540307044983
1,0,uh thank you .,15,0.5,0.5158276557922363
0,0,"okay . about the components design . um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . but if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . so i do n't think it 's really an option . uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . it 's really up the the design that we 're gon na use . it 's uh does n't uh imply any technical restrictions . uh as a case supplement , we could um , i thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . and the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we 're using an l_c_d_ uh screen . and as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it does n't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . form should follow function overall . um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . but depends on what we want . i think we should disc discuss that . um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . and the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . and that 's it .",15,0.5,0.4162065386772156
0,0,okay . thank you . so that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . mm .,15,0.5,0.4952782094478607

1,0,"so first thing is we need power source for the remote control . so i was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there 's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it 'll be pretty uh innovative kind . then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it 's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t",15,0.5,0.63365238904953
0,0,i guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy .,15,0.5,0.36563441157341003
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5721560716629028
0,0,yeah . so there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . the s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they do n't feel that it 's an alien thing for them .,15,0.5,0.44803062081336975
0,0,"so , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? you reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard 'cause i 'm not sure",15,0.5,0.4273146092891693
0,0,"double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if i 'm right . so it 's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is .",15,0.5,0.492549866437912
0,0,"okay , but like , kind of convex or concave ?",15,0.5,0.4621242582798004
1,0,"so , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want .",15,0.5,0.5495170950889587
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4535418152809143
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5458354353904724
0,0,"so there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves .",15,0.5,0.32308563590049744
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5486154556274414
0,0,"these are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we can not have double curve . so there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is i think is the most appropriate one ,",15,0.5,0.49947768449783325
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.47188282012939453
1,0,it 'll bring the cost down,15,0.5,0.6487126350402832
0,0,"although , you know , wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option ,",15,0.5,0.4828413724899292
1,0,and anyway it 's,15,0.5,0.5705359578132629
1,0,"if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that 's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on .",15,0.5,0.5247287750244141
0,0,mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be,15,0.5,0.37025728821754456
1,0,wooden cases,15,0.5,0.6062847971916199
0,0,"well it depends , i mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not gon na break so you do n't have to worry too much about the case being broken ,",15,0.5,0.40018516778945923
0,0,yeah but the components inside .,15,0.5,0.35070186853408813
1,0,it 's the inside . yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that 's not visible to the to the user .,15,0.5,0.609976053237915
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4679974913597107
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5584027767181396
1,0,very too expensive to do .,15,0.5,0.5269507169723511
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4984665811061859
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5807656645774841
1,0,and also uh,15,0.5,0.6880784630775452
1,0,"and i mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well .",15,0.5,0.556721031665802
1,0,yeah but it 's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood .,15,0.5,0.5376747250556946
0,0,"that 's true , but are we set on the banana idea ?",15,0.5,0.4843972325325012
0,0,well it look like,15,0.5,0.45676833391189575
1,0,actually,15,0.5,0.5281385183334351
1,0,it looks like you are all targeting that,15,0.5,0.5280798077583313
1,0,i was thinking that the,15,0.5,0.5000728964805603
1,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.6876096129417419
1,0,the shape of a banana is not it 's not really handy .,15,0.5,0.5634616613388062
1,0,yes it is .,15,0.5,0.5235499143600464
1,0,uh i do n't know the name o o in english uh this,15,0.5,0.580491304397583
1,0,is it an e apple which has,15,0.5,0.5756386518478394
0,0,it 's not a fruit it 's a vegetable .,15,0.5,0.47776198387145996
0,0,it 's like a pumpkin or,15,0.5,0.4464558959007263
1,0,yeah ? pumpkin .,15,0.5,0.5795748233795166
1,0,green .,15,0.5,0.5559040904045105

1,0,"um um um , yes i see .",15,0.5,0.5291769504547119
1,0,what does it taste like ?,15,0.5,0.5852149128913879
1,0,and you put in the salad .,15,0.5,0.525728166103363
1,0,pep pepperoni .,15,0.5,0.5095741748809814
1,0,"ah yeah ,",15,0.5,0.5456832051277161
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.5560721755027771
1,0,is it what 's it in french ?,15,0.5,0.5530479550361633
1,0,poivron .,15,0.5,0.5259520411491394
0,0,oui c'est ca,15,0.5,0.46904054284095764
1,0,"yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5816012620925903
1,0,uh pepper .,15,0.5,0.5522847175598145
1,0,pepper .,15,0.5,0.5262660384178162
1,0,but um they do d,15,0.5,0.527522623538971
0,0,and it 's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of,15,0.5,0.44058889150619507
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6767840385437012
0,0,"i do n't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like",15,0.5,0.4562625288963318
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6666883826255798
1,0,"no , i mean in a",15,0.5,0.5582560896873474
1,0,it 's not re it,15,0.5,0.6600930690765381
0,0,like with a banana you can have,15,0.5,0.39842018485069275
1,0,you you think it 's really fancy and fun ? you think that young people that are,15,0.5,0.5167648196220398
1,0,i 'm sure it 's fun .,15,0.5,0.6500244736671448
1,0,yeah . more than a banana ?,15,0.5,0.6494906544685364
0,0,"but banana is not so handy ,",15,0.5,0.4030224084854126
1,0,well,15,0.5,0.5827110409736633
0,0,"banana is more handier as compared to this i think , and to capsicum .",15,0.5,0.48488178849220276
1,0,i think that 's handier .,15,0.5,0.6347262859344482
0,0,but like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top,15,0.5,0.40859726071357727
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.504912793636322
1,0,"and just roll it back and forth like that ,",15,0.5,0.617720901966095
1,0,it 's kind it 's kind of it 's more uh,15,0.5,0.5148956179618835
1,0,but with uh i do n't know how you would hold a capsicum and,15,0.5,0.5220694541931152
1,0,"it 's really ergonomic , it 's fit in the hand and you 've a lot of surface to to put the controls .",15,0.5,0.5341800451278687
0,0,okay let 's move on .,15,0.5,0.3852623403072357
1,0,yeah you 're right .,15,0.5,0.577841579914093
1,0,"so time is running , let 's move on .",15,0.5,0.5973148941993713
0,0,"okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they do n't feel they are alienated , just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that .",15,0.5,0.4084260165691376
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5678913593292236
0,0,"yeah , we can go to the next slide . then uh there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . so we can have regular chip for control . pricing is a factor for us , that 's why we 'll go for the regular chip . and uh regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced .",15,0.5,0.49065300822257996
0,0,"so is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of",15,0.5,0.44619089365005493
1,0,it could be a beep kind of thing .,15,0.5,0.6260281801223755
0,0,"okay , but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ?",15,0.5,0.420875608921051
0,0,"yes , yes , that 's right , it 's it 's onto the chip ,",15,0.5,0.43769699335098267
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6801881790161133
1,0,"most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that .",15,0.5,0.5971018671989441
0,0,okay . so are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ?,15,0.5,0.39672771096229553
0,0,"that will be the volume control i think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . it should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside .",15,0.5,0.4890880286693573
0,0,"okay . yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it 's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker .",15,0.5,0.4447292685508728
1,0,"mm-hmm . uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .",15,0.5,0.5607461929321289
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.573752760887146
1,0,"as or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place ,",15,0.5,0.526557445526123
1,0,yeah . so that 's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside .,15,0.5,0.5005376935005188
1,0,"so that that 's right . okay . yeah . so these these were the component selection and these things . we can go to the next slide . and uh these were the findings which i i saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our t_v_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like v_c_r_ d_v_d_ players which are usually attached with the t_v_ , because users are like this and they do n't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us .",15,0.5,0.6650894284248352
0,0,"although , if it depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wan na sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device .",15,0.5,0.37759098410606384
0,0,mm . of fruits .,15,0.5,0.41451549530029297
1,0,"cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type .",15,0.5,0.5254797339439392
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.499944806098938
0,0,s objects .,15,0.5,0.4839209020137787
1,0,"remotes objects , okay .",15,0.5,0.6669489741325378
0,0,crazy objects .,15,0.5,0.4145914614200592
1,0,i think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits .,15,0.5,0.6108613014221191
0,0,"well , you 're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place .",15,0.5,0.39380693435668945
1,0,no but i think just one fruit to control everything .,15,0.5,0.5204706192016602
0,0,like a power fruit .,15,0.5,0.36861297488212585
0,0,"a power fr a power m a mando , a supermando fruit .",15,0.5,0.4757062494754791
0,0,and uh as well as i could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s,15,0.5,0.41841286420822144
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.47261419892311096
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4850543141365051
1,0,and we should have it on the remote .,15,0.5,0.6534640192985535
0,0,"okay , good .",15,0.5,0.3993704915046692
0,0,well,15,0.5,0.43509966135025024
1,0,actually i i did n't understand very well this trace speaker lost control .,15,0.5,0.6793888807296753
1,0,so you 're having a basis station . okay . your usually your remote sits on that . so you and it 's that 's why it can have chargeable batteries . now let 's say,15,0.5,0.603346586227417
0,0,"so you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station .",15,0.5,0.3554076850414276
1,0,bu it 's it 's .,15,0.5,0.5700713992118835
0,0,basis station is with the thing .,15,0.5,0.3905949294567108
0,0,you s you you thing .,15,0.5,0.49101975560188293
0,0,"it 's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . so now what user gets additionally he does n't have to buy batteries , they 're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he 'll recover the cost . so you 're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it 'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . uh",15,0.5,0.31745994091033936
0,0,i think that 's a pretty handy feature .,15,0.5,0.49930623173713684
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.42560991644859314
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4882088303565979
1,0,"i think it 's kind of people would find that worth it even if it was n't uh a recharging station , even if they did n't have to buy extra batteries , you know .",15,0.5,0.6832672953605652
0,0,"mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",15,0.5,0.4037904739379883
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5245707035064697
1,0,yeah but i 'm a bit worried about the budget .,15,0.5,0.5748397707939148
1,0,"uh this is basis station is nothing more , just it 's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you 're having one socket on which the thing sits .",15,0.5,0.6220381855964661
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.29153871536254883
1,0,although you do need to include r_f_ kind of circuitry in the remote .,15,0.5,0.6404658555984497
0,0,that 's right . but all these things are usually in-house so we do n't have much problems .,15,0.5,0.4190022647380829
1,0,"so component cost is going to be the least . anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , l_c_d_ has already been ruled out , a_s_r_ has been ruled out . so it 's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly .",15,0.5,0.5661592483520508
0,0,"okay . i 'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , i this whole fruit thing with the banana , it 's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana ,",15,0.5,0.435491681098938
1,0,and,15,0.5,0.5602171421051025
1,0,"but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? you know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . and um , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . for better want of a better word",15,0.5,0.5204330682754517
0,0,you think that yellow it 's kitsch .,15,0.5,0.47001954913139343
1,0,you know ?,15,0.5,0.5252821445465088
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5291656851768494
1,0,"well , you know , i don i do n't know how many peop",15,0.5,0.6457085609436035
0,0,if you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana .,15,0.5,0.4370943307876587
1,0,"yeah . no , i i",15,0.5,0.5739305019378662
1,0,"a yeah , otherwise it 'll be mis means you do n't get b any feeling then .",15,0.5,0.5598249435424805
1,0,well they,15,0.5,0.5346274971961975
1,0,o otherwise,15,0.5,0.5304827690124512
1,0,maybe li like that .,15,0.5,0.7104333639144897
1,0,it 's neither a banana nor a,15,0.5,0.5668731331825256
0,0,"yeah , like this colour this colour maybe , you know , maybe like still in the shape of a banana .",15,0.5,0.407730370759964
1,0,roughly .,15,0.5,0.577509343624115
1,0,"no , exactly .",15,0.5,0.5918409824371338
0,0,"exactly . um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know because the thing is it 's gon na be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . i think if you 're gon na not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies .",15,0.5,0.49935364723205566
0,0,yeah . okay . let 's move on .,15,0.5,0.4779519736766815
1,0,and uh going to the last slide .,15,0.5,0.5368434190750122
1,0,uh uh yeah . before before st before ending the meeting i 'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype .,15,0.5,0.501495361328125
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5509904623031616
0,0,go for it .,15,0.5,0.4625467360019684

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3396874666213989
1,0,"it sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . so the things i 'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that 's pretty much covered . we can do that . what goes wrong at the user . gets the remote control . where is the remote control ? we 've all had it once , i want to watch some television ,",15,0.5,0.687717080116272

0,0,that seems very good .,15,0.5,0.4736417233943939
1,0,"a really good idea . uh these are just the issues . i come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . searches for the button . there are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear .",15,0.5,0.555080771446228
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4459354877471924

1,0,"there 's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you do n't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that ,",15,0.5,0.544597864151001
1,0,"okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . okay .",15,0.5,0.5360705852508545
0,0,"yes . uh covered that . oh yes , user presses the button . um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . so you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that ,",15,0.5,0.46475785970687866
0,0,"okay , so the buttons should be",15,0.5,0.43538153171539307
1,0,so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control .,15,0.5,0.5126908421516418
1,0,mm-hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5511303544044495
0,0,"and possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger",15,0.5,0.37037229537963867
1,0,wow . the s yeah . make it make them bigger .,15,0.5,0.6221362948417664
1,0,si,15,0.5,0.5070989727973938
1,0,even more durable uh .,15,0.5,0.5862764120101929
0,0,"so this is basically what i h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others . uh",15,0.5,0.4497000277042389
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5746002197265625
0,0,"this i pretty much covered . so what we want to go to is not this one ,",15,0.5,0.4740327000617981
1,0,"yeah , it 's true .",15,0.5,0.5341665744781494
0,0,"but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .",15,0.5,0.35701417922973633
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6561093330383301
0,0,that 's basically uh what i had in mind . so,15,0.5,0.4278683066368103
1,0,"yeah , that 's clear .",15,0.5,0.736380398273468
1,0,"this is not the final design ,",15,0.5,0.5370991826057434
1,0,"no , of course uh",15,0.5,0.5322543978691101
1,0,this is just a general idea of how i 'd like to see uh basically the general idea .,15,0.5,0.5568588376045227
1,0,yeah . i must say that it hmm .,15,0.5,0.5504273176193237
1,0,so that was it .,15,0.5,0.5974428653717041
0,0,"that was it . okay , that was good . so we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing ,",15,0.5,0.49271923303604126
1,0,"yeah , i think it 's a really good idea .",15,0.5,0.5063728094100952
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5135114192962646
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.557624340057373
1,0,"the other aspects , we 'll just see how what you came up with and what 's possible for that budget .",15,0.5,0.5659153461456299
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.48325473070144653
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4738967716693878
1,0,"okay , that 's fine . um . okay , now work a little with me . okay . well ,",15,0.5,0.5246477723121643
1,0,"let 's start it as it is . okay , uh the method . there are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do .",15,0.5,0.531984269618988
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4982600212097168
1,0,"and uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? i 'll tell you why that 's important to me . um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that 's why i also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh i heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already .",15,0.5,0.5510984063148499
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4883083403110504
0,0,"so keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built .",15,0.5,0.46042948961257935
1,0,"yeah . of course , hmm .",15,0.5,0.5729643702507019
0,0,so it 's that 's not as easy as it s might look like .,15,0.5,0.46746963262557983
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5258612036705017
1,0,"uh material study , i 'm working on that um for the the costs . i have to check out how far i can go with that . normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , i think we can just go on with that . um then i 've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . the more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper .",15,0.5,0.5110589265823364
0,0,you mean integrate them all into the circuit board . okay .,15,0.5,0.44977471232414246
1,0,"exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that 's cheaper .",15,0.5,0.5330588817596436
1,0,"yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.5044476389884949
1,0,so we have to make something that 's not too difficult in design again .,15,0.5,0.5632086992263794
1,0,so you have,15,0.5,0.5855197906494141
0,0,"this is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . you have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . the switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a morse code , that 's how you should see it . the morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . you have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it ? uh a light in indication , light that you know that it 's functioning .",15,0.5,0.4576631188392639
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6338663697242737
0,0,"uh here again , that 's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different morse code when some button is pressed . that makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . uh i do n't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light .",15,0.5,0.4441033601760864
1,0,okay . okay . that was it ?,15,0.5,0.5580636858940125
0,0,that was it .,15,0.5,0.4979184865951538
1,0,"i 'll get back to my thing then . uh okay , back this up to the screen . so i got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , nowadays people do n't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either well , i do n't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it .",15,0.5,0.5209769606590271
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5143888592720032
1,0,"but i do n't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . it 's not important anymore . um we 're targeting young people now , because our um this is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people ,",15,0.5,0.5326454639434814
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.41796955466270447
1,0,which are um the younger people were defined under forty .,15,0.5,0.563589870929718
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.469186931848526
1,0,i so i think it 's,15,0.5,0.6026855111122131
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3877899944782257
1,0,"that 's also good with the fashion and everything ,",15,0.5,0.63988196849823
1,0,b,15,0.5,0.511533796787262
0,0,so yeah .,15,0.5,0.4771735370159149
0,0,"yeah , and they want to pay for it",15,0.5,0.43724340200424194
1,0,"they want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like .",15,0.5,0.6880173683166504
0,0,and uh,15,0.5,0.2775877118110657
1,0,"if they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they 're actually gon na spend uh spend money on it .",15,0.5,0.697653591632843
0,0,with more where with more technical specifications,15,0.5,0.4123602509498596
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6043903827667236
1,0,in the,15,0.5,0.5577818155288696
0,0,"see how far we can go with it anyway , so",15,0.5,0.49984341859817505
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5777270197868347
1,0,"and one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , but i 'm not sure if we i think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody 's taste . so with that concept i started thinking , so why not just steal nokia 's idea and just make changeable covers for your",15,0.5,0.508797287940979
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.4285838305950165
1,0,"i mean those cost hardly anything i think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover",15,0.5,0.5533449649810791
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3293256461620331
1,0,"and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design . and sell the covers separately , for example . that 's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . so you do n't have to i think you do n't have to make entire remote controls . we make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately .",15,0.5,0.6285396218299866
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.38793060183525085
1,0,so that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . so,15,0.5,0.5362445712089539
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4538589119911194
1,0,"just i 'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . would you like to share ?",15,0.5,0.6027078628540039
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5421950221061707
1,0,"no , i think this is a good idea .",15,0.5,0.5217693448066711
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5128620862960815
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.535274863243103
1,0,but oh ?,15,0.5,0.5276722311973572
1,0,is it manageable ? is it easy ?,15,0.5,0.5269131660461426
1,0,go ahead .,15,0.5,0.5354494452476501
1,0,"yeah , with with an l_c_d_ screen you can",15,0.5,0.5778740048408508
1,0,"oh yeah . i think we should lose the l_c_d_ screen ,",15,0.5,0.6544390916824341
1,0,"y yes , i think so too .",15,0.5,0.5932332277297974
0,0,"like you said . i think for example it 's it 's huge i think the l_c_d_ is huge ,",15,0.5,0.44499534368515015
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6372417211532593
1,0,why ? nokia w,15,0.5,0.5295940637588501
1,0,it consumes batteries like hell .,15,0.5,0.6368329524993896
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.3427913784980774
1,0,i think it takes up a lot of a lot of power .,15,0.5,0.6649888753890991
0,0,"and it costs too much to fabricate ,",15,0.5,0.27482372522354126
1,0,"it costs a lot , i think .",15,0.5,0.600994884967804
0,0,so we 're on a tight budget here .,15,0.5,0.3885025680065155
1,0,"okay , uh",15,0.5,0.5447546243667603
0,0,"what we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an l_c_d_ screen but with a preview ,",15,0.5,0.4732877016067505
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6012115478515625
0,0,"but y i 'm not sure if it 's even possible . for example , a little t_v_ guide .",15,0.5,0.3940485715866089
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.44657111167907715
1,0,like you have a little,15,0.5,0.6000741720199585
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3609905242919922
1,0,"just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing",15,0.5,0.6289590001106262
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4350351095199585
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5144269466400146
1,0,"so you can use your remote as a t_v_ guide . i 'm not sure it 's even possible ,",15,0.5,0.5938199162483215
0,0,"hmm . i have to check that out ,",15,0.5,0.36162570118904114
1,0,"but maybe okay , make it",15,0.5,0.6362494826316833
1,0,i 'm not sure .,15,0.5,0.6599313616752625
0,0,"yeah , find a little compromise in that , but what did i write down ?",15,0.5,0.455963671207428
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4646952450275421
1,0,"i think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your t_v_",15,0.5,0.5288935899734497
1,0,that must be possible .,15,0.5,0.5499910712242126
0,0,"and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . i think it 's easy to implement ,",15,0.5,0.4133327603340149
1,0,ja .,15,0.5,0.5536842942237854
1,0,we should go for that .,15,0.5,0.5273683667182922
0,0,"i 'm sorry ,",15,0.5,0.39666882157325745
1,0,uh speech recognition .,15,0.5,0.6534411311149597
0,0,and it 's,15,0.5,0.39787766337394714
0,0,whe where do you wan na hit the t_ you wan na we want a button on the television .,15,0.5,0.4307941496372223
1,0,"i thin yeah , i mean where else should you put it ?",15,0.5,0.5060657858848572
1,0,"in th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control .",15,0.5,0.6289542317390442
0,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.46005702018737793
0,0,because that 's not possible uh .,15,0.5,0.4641767144203186
1,0,"but how are you gon na use that if your i mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gon na press where are you gon na press the button ?",15,0.5,0.5535290241241455
1,0,uh . yeah . exactly .,15,0.5,0.502998948097229
0,0,maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal .,15,0.5,0.38462385535240173
1,0,"a slap-on sticker . oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your t_v_ .",15,0.5,0.6803995370864868
0,0,mm uh .,15,0.5,0.3130042552947998
1,0,"yeah , that could be possible .",15,0.5,0.5848811268806458
1,0,"yeah , exactly .",15,0.5,0.5444847345352173
1,0,"a little little box you can attach to your t_v_ is fine then , okay .",15,0.5,0.5624364018440247
1,0,"okay , then uh i 'd i 'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that 's uh determines everything i 'm gon na do .",15,0.5,0.5626421570777893
0,0,"i think it 's universal . i think we should go for universal ,",15,0.5,0.46695685386657715
1,0,if not,15,0.5,0.5368251204490662
1,0,because apparently we 're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people .,15,0.5,0.552671492099762
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.31814393401145935
1,0,i think universal remote control should be possible .,15,0.5,0.6559858918190002
0,0,yeah . um,15,0.5,0.42959874868392944
1,0,"okay , then i go for that .",15,0.5,0.5521048307418823
0,0,"everyone uh wants to buy it , so we w",15,0.5,0.4856102466583252
0,0,"yeah , i think we 're targeting everyone ,",15,0.5,0.49528953433036804
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5696175694465637

1,0,"okay . no ,",15,0.5,0.5084537267684937
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5863840579986572
0,0,"it 's fine with me , but then i know what to look for .",15,0.5,0.4650018811225891
1,0,"okay , universal is good . speech recognition , i think it 's very hard , because we 're selling across multiple countries . so i think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it 's very hard to do .",15,0.5,0.593315839767456
0,0,yeah . or one .,15,0.5,0.4985322058200836
1,0,and it 's,15,0.5,0.554787278175354
0,0,"or when you say one two uh i it uh it 's enough ,",15,0.5,0.4714643061161041
1,0,"yeah , but i do n't see arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever .",15,0.5,0.5917741656303406
1,0,right ? but oh yeah .,15,0.5,0.7039731740951538
0,0,"besides that , the technology is n't really super yet , so that is a problem in implementing this .",15,0.5,0.4987523853778839
0,0,it 's yeah .,15,0.5,0.3955256938934326
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.531207263469696
1,0,"it 's not a mature technology , i think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control ,",15,0.5,0.5793458819389343
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4172532260417938
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5059939026832581

1,0,i do n't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh .,15,0.5,0.5945671200752258
0,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.39850136637687683
1,0,what else do we have ?,15,0.5,0.5006104111671448

1,0,kinda like those kind of batteries .,15,0.5,0.5547426342964172

1,0,yeah well it 's a good question .,15,0.5,0.5868005156517029
1,0,it just was in there,15,0.5,0.5102094411849976
1,0,well uh,15,0.5,0.5036630034446716
1,0,"and i did n't have any information about it ,",15,0.5,0.6012975573539734
0,0,"chip on print , i think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it 's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button .",15,0.5,0.39238113164901733
1,0,but mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5914008617401123
0,0,"but when you got a l_c_d_ screen , with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place ,",15,0.5,0.42205455899238586
1,0,"yeah , okay . but",15,0.5,0.6291152238845825
0,0,"for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations are n't always the same .",15,0.5,0.42439883947372437
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6335787177085876
0,0,"when you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the",15,0.5,0.4236268997192383
1,0,"yeah okay , but the p print plate of l_ l_c_d_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate ,",15,0.5,0.5327455401420593
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6272827386856079
1,0,"so that that 's not of any discussion , i think .",15,0.5,0.5342614054679871
0,0,"well you need some kind of c_p_u_ , i guess .",15,0.5,0.47101709246635437
1,0,i suppose so .,15,0.5,0.5378443002700806
0,0,"mm , i do n't i dunno i do n't think that 's",15,0.5,0.4753313660621643
0,0,it is a simple c_p_u_ but it does n't,15,0.5,0.47744035720825195
1,0,yeah yeah okay but i d i i do n't know if nor o s it 's quite a simple l_c_d_ .,15,0.5,0.5527804493904114
1,0,yeah because it has to uh b,15,0.5,0.6141950488090515
1,0,"yeah , it 's quite a simple l_c_d_ screen . i think they do n't need that big of c_p_u_ .",15,0.5,0.5472540855407715
1,0,yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you 're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume .,15,0.5,0.6290576457977295
0,0,"yeah , okay , true true . true .",15,0.5,0.4945515990257263
1,0,so it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or c_p_u_,15,0.5,0.6066786646842957
1,0,to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment .,15,0.5,0.5186517834663391
0,0,mm-hmm . because we 're projecting projecting the buttons on the l_c_d_ screen .,15,0.5,0.4610798954963684
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6766238808631897
0,0,and a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen .,15,0.5,0.4802219867706299
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.618496298789978
1,0,"and the case , yeah we already discussed the case ,",15,0.5,0.5355582237243652
1,0,it 's rubber .,15,0.5,0.5988848209381104
1,0,we wanted to make it from rubber,15,0.5,0.5591345429420471
0,0,yeah but but a hard rubber like this ?,15,0.5,0.45108258724212646
1,0,and uh,15,0.5,0.6449477672576904
1,0,or softer rubber or,15,0.5,0.632896900177002
0,0,uh hard rubber i think .,15,0.5,0.3778083026409149
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.49920663237571716

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5380911231040955

1,0,"so the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? no i do n't think , i think it 's more round than square .",15,0.5,0.6512377262115479
0,0,"yeah it 's a bit . but i think it should be a bit longer , perhaps .",15,0.5,0.2579917311668396
1,0,so it meets i think it meets more the young people than the older people .,15,0.5,0.737704873085022
0,0,"yeah . but that 's what we want , .",15,0.5,0.3879896402359009

1,0,so you 're not gon na find my uh my folder up there i got ta do mine up at the board .,15,0.5,0.5595210790634155
0,0,have you ? okay .,15,0.5,0.47877833247184753
1,0,yeah yeah . so,15,0.5,0.5850078463554382
1,0,can i not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ?,15,0.5,0.6036853194236755
0,0,no it 's not in there because i had the computer problem and i i i cou i could n't create it .,15,0.5,0.44863131642341614
1,0,oh i see i see .,15,0.5,0.6339468955993652
0,0,"i could n't create it in the powerpoint ,",15,0.5,0.40505003929138184
1,0,"and i think i 've got this really strange cable . so what i had , basically going from the powerpoint format , is that uh yeah yeah i like this a lot . is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ?",15,0.5,0.6295526027679443
0,0,nah .,15,0.5,0.42237478494644165
1,0,"so what we had is we had the method . that 's not how you spell method , is it ?",15,0.5,0.5848467946052551
0,0,no way .,15,0.5,0.49963799118995667
1,0,"no a_ . . so this does n't go so fast this way . and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product huh . and uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . we 've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the i i do n't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the corp corporate help me . the the corporation stands behind the product , okay . so the features i think we got the scroll , we 've got the uh the locator , we 've got the durability , we 've got the dependability ,",15,0.5,0.5389884114265442
0,0,it fell off .,15,0.5,0.39695894718170166
1,0,we 've got you know the features that make this a unique product . um,15,0.5,0.6175013780593872
0,0,beep beep beep .,15,0.5,0.39104923605918884
1,0,"the characteristics i talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . uh and the corporation , we 're talking about we 're we 're a new we 're a new company . we 're wanting to make a name for ourself . we 're wanting you to uh find our product so we 're gon na give you a good product at a fair price . one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? that was something i would be interested in . um so yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , i believe , to make it marketable i believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros . we 're gon na be competitive , and we 're gon na we 're gon na have a market niche . um w",15,0.5,0.7633765339851379
1,0,"do you would you a argue that that we 're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?",15,0.5,0.5437929630279541
0,0,"that that would be uh that would be i think a decision best made by corporate um i i m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , i th i think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .",15,0.5,0.4169992208480835
0,0,mm-hmm . mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.3687116205692291
1,0,"but i 'm sh i 'm sure open to to market this in either direction . but you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost i think it uh there 's nobody else that 's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . the only limitations i see to this is that we 're focused on television only . uh that 's the only that 's the only drawback i see to this . but with all of these other features i think people c one thing i 'm i 'm hoping for is people are not gon na even notice . there 's gon na be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing does n't work for my d_v_d_ and my but i like these other things , so they keep it , they do n't take it back .",15,0.5,0.699435293674469
0,0,"and we 're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , are n't we ? th there 's no fundamentally different technology to do that .",15,0.5,0.4273208677768707
1,0,well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?,15,0.5,0.534040629863739
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.42653191089630127
1,0,you know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . you know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after,15,0.5,0.6054391860961914
1,0,"w we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but",15,0.5,0.5435701608657837
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5111373662948608
1,0,"mm-hmm , but you follow what i 'm s i 'm s",15,0.5,0.5001068711280823
1,0,we we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . but uh,15,0.5,0.5470080375671387
1,0,"yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we 're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that 's that was just an idea i had . uh to me the only additions",15,0.5,0.6318134069442749
0,0,"yeah , the plus there 's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it 's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it 's very simple , and it just works .",15,0.5,0.3086450695991516
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6579433083534241
0,0,mm there 's a risk of that .,15,0.5,0.3662030100822449
1,1,and then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we 've uh made in the second point . so i will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board .,15,0.5,0.5709450244903564
0,0,what an original idea .,15,0.5,0.49048730731010437
1,0,do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ?,15,0.5,0.5388949513435364

1,0,okay so i hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control .,15,0.5,0.6392326951026917
0,0,"is it for uh for putting a for logos , no .",15,0.5,0.33243072032928467

1,0,okay ? so we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first i will show the agenda so we will uh i will take notes during this meeting so i will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards,15,0.5,0.5777362585067749
0,0,"so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . then i will uh present you some new project requirements i received from uh the management board . then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions and then i will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . of the of the process . so uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did ?",15,0.5,0.46044617891311646

1,0,over . okay .,15,0.5,0.5118997693061829
1,0,no . there is nothing .,15,0.5,0.6149569749832153
0,0,there 's no we have a technical problem .,15,0.5,0.4004741907119751
1,0,let 's go and check .,15,0.5,0.609451174736023
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5805397033691406
1,0,i 'll go and check .,15,0.5,0.5619059205055237
0,0,"otherwise , could you just describe by hand ?",15,0.5,0.3448684513568878
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5374357104301453
1,0,with the the whiteboard ?,15,0.5,0.5164462327957153
0,0,if you remember yeah,15,0.5,0.4354248642921448
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5948677659034729
0,0,but that 's,15,0.5,0.4939315915107727
1,0,so uh . basically what we want here is a remote control right .,15,0.5,0.5709750652313232
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3729800879955292
1,0,so um the question well first of all what to control . so most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and t_v_ and stuff like that .,15,0.5,0.6856293678283691
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.29466983675956726
1,0,and but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff,15,0.5,0.6289525628089905
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.36092936992645264
1,0,and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house .,15,0.5,0.6010703444480896
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.45648786425590515
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5085927248001099
1,0,"yeah , so there 's a project i think called x_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . so",15,0.5,0.5719552636146545
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3279748558998108
1,0,there is one that is one thing . the other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have,15,0.5,0.6048506498336792
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.33176302909851074
1,0,uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah . so i think it should be a package in that case .,15,0.5,0.5635839700698853
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4482359290122986
0,0,"uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . one is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space ,",15,0.5,0.4772176444530487
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.45152080059051514
0,0,a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .,15,0.5,0.38162052631378174
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.47487694025039673
1,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.5625560283660889
1,0,what do you mean by linear access then ?,15,0.5,0.5229833722114563
1,0,"like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah .",15,0.5,0.5243923664093018
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.39640507102012634
1,0,"okay so special navigation , linear access , random access",15,0.5,0.5956017971038818
0,0,um .,15,0.5,0.4571763873100281
1,0,and there 's a fourth one no ?,15,0.5,0.5586098432540894
0,0,mm ?,15,0.5,0.38792335987091064
1,0,so the better now for special navigation ?,15,0.5,0.5164363384246826
0,0,yeah . for special navigation for example you might have a t_v_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ?,15,0.5,0.3643287122249603
1,0,okay . then linear access,15,0.5,0.5375757217407227
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.48202380537986755
1,0,then random access .,15,0.5,0.5407637357711792
0,0,mm . yeah and also parameter changing .,15,0.5,0.4263647198677063
1,0,ah yeah parameter okay .,15,0.5,0.605241060256958
0,0,so if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um,15,0.5,0.4266433119773865
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.44264549016952515
1,0,or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff .,15,0.5,0.5598636269569397
0,0,okay . okay and and voice command did you uh,15,0.5,0.38402971625328064
0,0,"voice command w we could specify anything . we could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power ,",15,0.5,0.3493354618549347
0,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.45226049423217773
0,0,i guess so . yeah .,15,0.5,0.4720432162284851
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.517104983329773
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6770867109298706
1,0,so that 's uh that close your investigations ?,15,0.5,0.5138254761695862
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.46160218119621277

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5677806735038757
0,0,not so far .,15,0.5,0.41914665699005127
1,1,"well that does n't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . um so , somehow that thing 's too big , but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . they say they could put it to work but um we do n't think so .",15,0.5,0.6339659094810486
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.3037596046924591
1,0,no . it it it you 'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and,15,0.5,0.5984469056129456
0,0,"if the t_v_ is working , yeah .",15,0.5,0.443940132856369
1,0,"that 's just i mean it 'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it 's gon na change the channel .",15,0.5,0.5176594853401184
1,0,"yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore ,",15,0.5,0.6124956607818604
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.3622879683971405
1,0,and i think that 's one of the things we wan na keep .,15,0.5,0.6313230991363525
0,0,"but what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? so if you pressed it and went , up ?",15,0.5,0.2812202572822571
1,0,that kinda would r d,15,0.5,0.5910080075263977
0,0,well then why do n't you just press the up button ?,15,0.5,0.480636864900589
1,0,man yeah .,15,0.5,0.5887245535850525
0,0,yeah . that would kind of lose it .,15,0.5,0.465219646692276
1,0,but if it 's just one thing with a button that you can just go up .,15,0.5,0.620161771774292
0,0,even still there 's gon na be interf th there 's there still will be interference from the t_v_ .,15,0.5,0.44654762744903564
0,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.4984104037284851
1,0,"yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.5797289609909058
1,0,"it might not be it might not be completely confusing , but i think you 'll still y it 's still",15,0.5,0.5236929655075073
0,0,i do n't think it 's practical at all . i think it 's a bad idea frankly .,15,0.5,0.48855987191200256
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5600149035453796
0,0,"yeah so um taking that away , our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable",15,0.5,0.39994293451309204

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6397117376327515
1,0,and so here we go . uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote,15,0.5,0.589973509311676
0,0,designer .,15,0.5,0.4637787342071533
1,0,"and um it is to send messages of course to the t_v_ . it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . um . should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .",15,0.5,0.5772450566291809
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.4405171573162079
1,0,and she was challenged on that point,15,0.5,0.6107414364814758
1,0,that 's right .,15,0.5,0.5506077408790588
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5134232640266418
1,0,"but uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that 's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . uh and of course a circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider .",15,0.5,0.54736328125
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4680480659008026
1,0,"she would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . the marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that 's really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .",15,0.5,0.5457091331481934

1,0,good point because we need the symbols 'cause we 're going into an international market we ca n't have anything that 's language dependent .,15,0.5,0.610551655292511

1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5473542213439941
1,0,well you know i think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow,15,0.5,0.6062788367271423
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5549002885818481
1,0,and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that,15,0.5,0.5560829043388367
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5533380508422852

0,0,"you know that would , that would really work .",15,0.5,0.36764392256736755
1,0,"now what , what are our special features for the marketing ?",15,0.5,0.6527770757675171
0,0,so,15,0.5,0.2523774206638336
1,0,that 's really the voice recognition that 's really unusual,15,0.5,0.6137304306030273
0,0,i think voice recognition is our big selling point,15,0.5,0.45721662044525146
0,0,mm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.39811447262763977
0,0,'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range .,15,0.5,0.4834565818309784
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.48496508598327637
1,0,"and then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use .",15,0.5,0.5993039608001709
1,0,yep,15,0.5,0.5049221515655518
1,0,you know .,15,0.5,0.645221471786499
1,0,"uh well i think that everybody 's gon na say their remote control is practical . i think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance .",15,0.5,0.5973771214485168
0,0,colours . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3329256772994995
1,0,we 're really gon na have the be the,15,0.5,0.6359380483627319
0,0,cutest .,15,0.5,0.38360902667045593
1,0,cutest remote control on the block .,15,0.5,0.6404967904090881
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4031303822994232
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4467805325984955
1,0,"so i think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition .",15,0.5,0.5973937511444092
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5116257071495056
1,0,i think those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they 're gon na be our two selling points .,15,0.5,0.6027992963790894
0,0,"okay , now uh having said that",15,0.5,0.4351636469364166
1,0,"i 'm supposed to make a little presentation , are n't i ?",15,0.5,0.5743425488471985
1,0,"no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done .",15,0.5,0.5142813920974731
1,1,we have a good price and uh .,15,0.5,0.6229462027549744
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5953768491744995
0,0,so this prototype is quite nice .,15,0.5,0.47270533442497253
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5613844394683838
1,0,good .,15,0.5,0.5128809809684753
1,0,"because i saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house ,",15,0.5,0.5105842351913452
0,0,yeah . okay .,15,0.5,0.4795511066913605
1,0,"uh quite big also ,",15,0.5,0.6668762564659119
0,0,"and they were selling something like a hundred euros , two hundred euros .",15,0.5,0.43799105286598206
1,0,"just a just a phone , wireless .",15,0.5,0.675055205821991
0,0,"so having this at twenty five euros is uh quite attractive , i think .",15,0.5,0.39162304997444153
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3964668810367584
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5810888409614563
0,0,i think the,15,0.5,0.4559418559074402
1,0,but almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not can not compare .,15,0.5,0.5328532457351685
0,0,"yeah . yeah ,",15,0.5,0.4554458260536194
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6150506734848022
1,0,"it 's much more complex , but",15,0.5,0.6392889618873596
0,0,"so , i think , we can summarise . so we have seen the prototype . it 's very nice according to the work of our two designer .",15,0.5,0.4360221028327942
1,1,okay .,15,0.5,0.5733931660652161
0,0,.,15,0.5,0.46812233328819275
1,0,right . okay . alright . is everyone here ?,15,0.5,0.5990368127822876
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4379993677139282
1,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.5572382807731628
1,0,"okay . this is our conceptual design meeting . and i 'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we 'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . um i 'll go through the mee through the minutes first . um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available .",15,0.5,0.5566084980964661
1,0,"um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . um and our marketing expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . people thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons .",15,0.5,0.5892723202705383
0,0,"um and that they often lose the it 's easy to lose a remote . um which were all things we were thinking we would wan na make it simple . um and uh some sort of locator . either a button or tracking device . um and that it should look different than what 's out there . um kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . the younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . um uh i think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers ' nerves . um then the user interface designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . um the simple versus the um the complex . the simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . um um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . um and that we did n't wan na go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . um we would just have a t_v_ remote . um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . have it s be something that looks different . and finally our um industrial designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . um from energy source , um uh what we would use . batteries because we do n't wan na have a a cable . um how that would power the remote and the lamp . if we were to to have one . uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the t_v_ . um i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . um um something that will fit into uh easily into someone 's hand . and with a , just a few buttons . just the basics . and with a scrolling um function also . okay and i will leave that , leave it at that . so marketing ?",15,0.5,0.3887580931186676
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.44467824697494507
1,0,we 're watching trends .,15,0.5,0.5791407227516174
0,0,yep . can i have your cable please ?,15,0.5,0.40338921546936035
1,0,i suppose that you can have this .,15,0.5,0.5007827281951904
1,0,"thanks . okay so i was looking at trend-watching . um unfortunately i was n't given too much information . i was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . and then i 'll just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that . um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which i think we 've kind of already discussed before . um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . and again these are all things we 've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . and thirdly the remote would be easy to use . as far as fashion update , we 've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .",15,0.5,0.5473135709762573
1,0,"so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . okay so from that um , as we 've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . um i think we 've already discovered that it 's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . but i think that , even if it 's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they 're getting something that 's new and modern and sleek and whether it 's through the shape or the colours or all of that . um for technologically innovative , we 've talked about the tracking device . we brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . and manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . we need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which i think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . i do n't know , i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable .",15,0.5,0.5085576772689819
1,0,a banana shape ?,15,0.5,0.6150744557380676
0,0,oh it was sort of banana shaped .,15,0.5,0.4638330936431885
1,0,"yeah . yeah . right . or with exterior designs . but my question is , i mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and i 'm not sure how they 'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside .",15,0.5,0.5225400328636169
0,0,"so maybe we could have something that 's somewhat removable , or i do n't know , different options for female , male target groups . and then the spongy feel . i guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that 's out there . c and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . so that 's that .",15,0.5,0.4733618497848511
0,0,"so possibly like a uh ,",15,0.5,0.42964863777160645
0,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.48307695984840393
1,0,"sorry , just to butt in for a second . possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ?",15,0.5,0.6075518727302551
0,0,that 's what i was thinking yeah .,15,0.5,0.4658720791339874
1,0,"those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones .",15,0.5,0.5795456767082214
0,0,"you have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that 's a spongy",15,0.5,0.4187302887439728
1,0,yeah . so when you buy your remote you can buy,15,0.5,0.6556528806686401
0,0,feel to it . you can,15,0.5,0.27387699484825134
1,0,various coverings .,15,0.5,0.6350311040878296
0,0,mm various covers .,15,0.5,0.47262436151504517
0,0,"what 's it called ? cust you personalised , yeah .",15,0.5,0.35311049222946167
1,0,personalise your remote .,15,0.5,0.6242098808288574
0,0,we could leave that to the cover department .,15,0.5,0.4286614656448364
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5134949684143066
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5410031080245972
1,0,we all know they 've got nothing to do all day .,15,0.5,0.5460729598999023
0,0,"okay . why ca n't i see the crazy . um yeah i talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . um so i 've looked at some of the stuff i was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . um i was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . they gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . um okay . there 's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . um there 's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . a command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . um and then it ju that 's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . you ca n't really see that picture well , but there 's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated .",15,0.5,0.49449166655540466
1,0,"so , then i had a look at new products that are on the market . not necessarily remote controls but ones that you 'll recognise . um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . i have a there is a picture . you surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ and audio . and you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . so the technology is there . um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . you can sort of just make those out . and then on the right is obviously an ipod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . that is a possibility . and nothing 's simpler really . um then there 's things like this , which is a a a kid 's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . so the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . and um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . so i do n't know if there 's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a v_ for volume . just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . um i think , d carrying on from what i 've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . maybe we 've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . and then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . um i do n't it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus . stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . and then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . and that is it . why am i oh yeah . just . where are we ? uh . just to sort of show you . m they 've even got things like that .",15,0.5,0.5029510259628296
0,0,huge things . which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ?,15,0.5,0.4761520028114319
1,0,"that 's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that .",15,0.5,0.5473617911338806

1,0,yeah . see . things . . why 's my screen crazy ?,15,0.5,0.6092736124992371
1,0,uh well let 's see . i 'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior .,15,0.5,0.5872921943664551
1,0,"just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . i 've more information on possible materials um as well . what we can and can not do . um but let 's just wait for this to load up and i 'll show you what we 're talking about here . okay . the details of the components ' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . the underside , that 's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it 's getting and will do what you tell it . um so much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . when you press a key um you complete a specific connection . the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . right . pretty clear . transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . the sensor in the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . this is the circuit board from the other side . um the lower part of it , i do n't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . um you can see the circuit board itself . that 's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . um what you do is you have , do n't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . these are the actual keys that are being pressed . they close the electric circuit . that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . that would be behind here . um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that",15,0.5,0.6022288799285889
1,0,"amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . um the way it works is that you have the keys here . the rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . and thus gives on the signal . now this is the simple version . um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . we are talking something more complicated of course , it 's going to be more expensive as well . and not only that . um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . um i 've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . so it 's pretty squishy . that would that would serve that purpose .",15,0.5,0.5151799321174622
1,1,"what about the user interface , there are also some some questions uh about the concepts i think you have some ideas on that .",15,0.5,0.501182496547699
1,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.6786403656005859
1,0,you you showed your drawing .,15,0.5,0.5085393786430359
0,0,"i had what i just uh i should again . i miss a few buttons , but . well . at least uh what we should also have on , i just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh if if you touch options , you ca n't go back to this uh right away now .",15,0.5,0.34277456998825073
1,0,"mm-hmm . yeah , you have to go back . yeah uh uh .",15,0.5,0.5776766538619995
1,0,this,15,0.5,0.5222790837287903
0,0,is n't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?,15,0.5,0.46269577741622925
1,0,i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.5578020215034485
0,0,with the minus and the plus .,15,0.5,0.3909077048301697
1,0,i think it 's,15,0.5,0.5785214900970459
0,0,i think it 's easier than,15,0.5,0.48420071601867676
1,0,"i do n't know . i i thought it was uh easier to handle this way ,",15,0.5,0.5602951049804688
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5631200075149536

1,0,for sound and channel .,15,0.5,0.5171889662742615
1,0,th,15,0.5,0.7152758836746216
0,0,depends on the screen . if you make the screen vertical it does n't matter . if you make it uh in a rectangle,15,0.5,0.4940849542617798
1,0,"right well if we make it like this , i think if you",15,0.5,0.519729495048523
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.579742968082428
1,0,i so it 's it 's it 's it 's,15,0.5,0.5578022003173828
0,0,put it like this,15,0.5,0.4255935847759247
1,0,square .,15,0.5,0.6213022470474243
0,0,"i think it 's it 's easier to have it something like oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . a minus here , plus over here .",15,0.5,0.253688782453537
1,0,"oh , okay .",15,0.5,0.5640894174575806

1,0,and the sound .,15,0.5,0.5110030174255371
0,0,i think that 's a matter of what you 're used to .,15,0.5,0.4975863993167877
1,0,something uh,15,0.5,0.5276786088943481
0,0,i think i would put a plus and a min uh here . and then the p_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle .,15,0.5,0.4847677946090698
1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.5426488518714905

1,0,yeah i think you 're going to s you 're going to use it with one thumb .,15,0.5,0.5021225214004517
1,0,yeah but i think yeah i do n't know . perhaps i have some examples .,15,0.5,0.5912702679634094

1,0,she is .,15,0.5,0.5326626300811768
0,0,but i 'm going to look if i 've got some examples,15,0.5,0.4139852821826935
1,0,'cause perhaps you should choose what 's most often used .,15,0.5,0.5271285772323608
1,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.5088008046150208

1,0,oh i have that those s numbers .,15,0.5,0.5740041732788086
0,0,i here is our here are uh,15,0.5,0.4077145755290985
1,0,or a good watch .,15,0.5,0.537504255771637
1,0,i do n't really know .,15,0.5,0.5081538558006287
0,0,b,15,0.5,0.4762386083602905
1,0,everybody 's searching in his data .,15,0.5,0.5279216170310974

0,0,channel selection . per hour one hundred and sixty eight . volume selection four times an hour,15,0.5,0.48053961992263794
1,0,yeah but but i mean if it 's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote .,15,0.5,0.6695696711540222
1,0,"yeah . so not how much n not how often it 's used , but",15,0.5,0.5137345194816589
1,0,uh,15,0.5,0.564506471157074
0,0,w what 's what 's usual or normal .,15,0.5,0.45325571298599243
1,0,"yeah , that depends on on on the remote .",15,0.5,0.6540233492851257
0,0,"yes i 'm looking here . but here 's it 's below ,",15,0.5,0.4623453915119171
1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.5929023623466492
1,0,"here also , and now here 's here 's next to each other .",15,0.5,0.5396824479103088
1,0,i think it 's it 's a,15,0.5,0.59173983335495
0,0,"i think because i have two televisions at home . one is horizontal , one is vertical ,",15,0.5,0.49332576990127563
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6038727760314941
1,0,"yeah it does it does n't really matter ,",15,0.5,0.6097620129585266
1,0,so it depends .,15,0.5,0.555213451385498
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.6014112234115601
1,0,yeah . depends .,15,0.5,0.534771740436554
1,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.5436046123504639
1,0,"i think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down .",15,0.5,0.5144819021224976
1,0,"yeah , lower .",15,0.5,0.5701966881752014
1,0,"and the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back .",15,0.5,0.5465517640113831
0,0,that 's how it 's is usually when i look here,15,0.5,0.4622068703174591
1,0,true .,15,0.5,0.5264307260513306
1,0,that 's what i see .,15,0.5,0.6060006618499756
1,0,"okay , um . let 's cut to the chase .",15,0.5,0.5115727186203003
1,0,it 's got to change .,15,0.5,0.5650736689567566
0,0,yeah well i think we have we do n't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons,15,0.5,0.4133026897907257
1,0,i do n't know .,15,0.5,0.5525897741317749
1,0,just the,15,0.5,0.5514061450958252
1,0,yeah is it is user interface .,15,0.5,0.531889796257019
1,0,concepts .,15,0.5,0.5255439281463623
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5034174919128418
1,0,component .,15,0.5,0.5632638931274414
0,0,"this concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a",15,0.5,0.4816989600658417
0,0,"okay , well le yeah . interface , yeah .",15,0.5,0.4337557554244995
1,0,and the speech uh shall we implement that ? or uh,15,0.5,0.7271702289581299
0,0,"yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ?",15,0.5,0.4988809823989868
0,0,"technologies , uh .",15,0.5,0.3731994926929474
0,0,"yeah i think it 's it 's easy for that , where are you , but then it says i 'm here .",15,0.5,0.47230833768844604
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6315345168113708
1,0,yeah . but then you should also find a place,15,0.5,0.5862416625022888
1,0,makes it possible to,15,0.5,0.5409125089645386
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5449569225311279
1,0,you could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . you can talk into the corner .,15,0.5,0.565589427947998
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3381478786468506
1,0,"yeah , a microphone , yeah .",15,0.5,0.599953830242157
1,0,"not even necessary ,",15,0.5,0.5614251494407654
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4697204530239105
1,0,"because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote .",15,0.5,0.5744616985321045
0,0,yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there 's also a microphone uh,15,0.5,0.4474213421344757
1,0,"yeah . but yeah , that 's also .",15,0.5,0.593489944934845
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.614825427532196
1,0,over there .,15,0.5,0.5551909804344177
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5602417588233948
1,0,"so , in the middle or something .",15,0.5,0.5554113388061523
0,0,but that 's not import i think that 's not im very important,15,0.5,0.4804524779319763
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5759680867195129
1,0,"because yeah , it does n't matter where the microphone is .",15,0.5,0.606232225894928
0,0,but you should uh decide where you want to put it .,15,0.5,0.48694267868995667
1,0,"ah okay , sure , okay ,",15,0.5,0.5333299040794373
1,0,right ?,15,0.5,0.5166181921958923
1,0,well tha,15,0.5,0.5933626294136047
1,0,um i think where it is n't seen,15,0.5,0.5577182173728943
1,0,underneath ? indeed . it should n't be uh very uh visible .,15,0.5,0.5248457193374634
1,0,the most .,15,0.5,0.5302526354789734
0,0,you could p you could put it in a logo of the company .,15,0.5,0.48486682772636414
1,0,inside .,15,0.5,0.5280206799507141
1,0,yeah . well,15,0.5,0.5003634691238403
1,0,"yeah sure , why no",15,0.5,0.5546215176582336
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6667998433113098
0,0,maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out,15,0.5,0.44251498579978943
1,0,i i between the round of the r_ .,15,0.5,0.6231529116630554
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.48064738512039185
1,0,"because i think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it ,",15,0.5,0.5747569799423218
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.32851868867874146
1,0,"because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control .",15,0.5,0.6570679545402527
0,0,yeah . so where do you want to put it ?,15,0.5,0.3615860939025879
1,0,"yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.6013687252998352
0,0,well maybe where the one hand,15,0.5,0.40898725390434265
1,0,yeah but it does n't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh,15,0.5,0.6043811440467834
1,0,yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it .,15,0.5,0.5145357251167297
1,0,yeah . yeah,15,0.5,0.5512824058532715
1,0,it 's a way for you to uh,15,0.5,0.5993764996528625
1,0,bu but,15,0.5,0.5447295308113098
0,0,uh .,15,0.5,0.38368892669677734
1,0,so it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes do n't have that .,15,0.5,0.6078462600708008
0,0,"yeah , okay .",15,0.5,0.4047282338142395
0,0,"but are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ?",15,0.5,0.47963258624076843
0,0,"about a microphone ,",15,0.5,0.4957384169101715
1,0,"yeah because a microphone is very small thing ,",15,0.5,0.6276891231536865
0,0,there is no button .,15,0.5,0.3949856162071228
1,0,but you can make it look like it 's big so as its its really an important function of the remote .,15,0.5,0.5699638724327087
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4775983393192291
1,0,i think the left s under corner should be the best .,15,0.5,0.5605778098106384
0,0,where is n't i it is n't most in sight .,15,0.5,0.42374107241630554
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5789015293121338
1,0,okay . well put it there . i do n't mind .,15,0.5,0.5571625232696533
1,0,i think .,15,0.5,0.5268762111663818
1,0,that does n't does n't really matter .,15,0.5,0.5281788110733032
0,0,no . actually does n't .,15,0.5,0.45336005091667175

0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.35945481061935425

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5274326205253601
1,0,"yeah , sure .",15,0.5,0.6059053540229797

1,0,"okay , well",15,0.5,0.6446185111999512
1,0,"it kinda does make sense , does n't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we 're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background .",15,0.5,0.5580265522003174
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.3905966281890869

1,0,okay we all ready to go ?,15,0.5,0.5438727140426636
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.48959019780158997
1,0,well how um on the in this meeting then if we um i 'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we uh decided on,15,0.5,0.689126193523407
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.46767449378967285
1,0,"decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five ,",15,0.5,0.6360937356948853
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6116812825202942
0,0,"and we decided that it was gon na be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we 're gon na group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um . and i told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . um so that was the last meeting .",15,0.5,0.4740811586380005
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5246654748916626
1,0,is there anything have i forgotten anything ?,15,0.5,0.5060766935348511
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.4180012047290802
1,0,is that everything ?,15,0.5,0.585587203502655
1,0,uh that sounds .,15,0.5,0.5640532970428467
0,0,"okay . um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you 're gon na want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we 'll have all the discussion at the end . that might be a better idea this time .",15,0.5,0.4800112247467041
1,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.5366994738578796
0,0,"and so if we start off uh with andrew and then craig and then david ,",15,0.5,0.4715726673603058
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5101855993270874
1,0,if that 's alright .,15,0.5,0.5094439387321472
1,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.6082708239555359
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.4451564848423004
1,0,"um and then after that we 'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right .",15,0.5,0.603585422039032
1,0,"yeah , cool .",15,0.5,0.6079885959625244
1,0,so if you wan na take this .,15,0.5,0.5865457057952881
0,0,why do n't i get that ? hmm .,15,0.5,0.39516714215278625
1,0,screwed in quite tightly . uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? we did we say we were gon na try maybe incorporate it but we had n't made a definite decision on that ?,15,0.5,0.6868056058883667
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5236928462982178
0,0,right . oh i should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .,15,0.5,0.4335200786590576
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6257014870643616
0,0,so um that 's kind of the end result hopefully .,15,0.5,0.47403302788734436
1,0,okay . um alright so c is it function f_ eight ?,15,0.5,0.6299381852149963
0,0,uh-huh . hopefully appear in a wee second .,15,0.5,0.44130900502204895
0,0,hmm . come on . i think it 's working .,15,0.5,0.45048561692237854
1,0,up there we go .,15,0.5,0.6361579895019531
1,0,okay great s so let me just start this . okay great . so um uh s move on . uh-huh oh where 'd it all go ?,15,0.5,0.5525897741317749
0,0,oh no .,15,0.5,0.4922584593296051
1,0,it 's not good . okay lem me just see where i can find it . this looks more like it . i think i just opened up the template .,15,0.5,0.524052619934082
1,0,oh right .,15,0.5,0.5700502395629883
1,0,sorry about that . okay alright so let 's have a look here .,15,0.5,0.5700321793556213
0,0,here we go .,15,0.5,0.4207589626312256
1,0,"okay so this was the method that um i 've taken . uh basically what i wan na do here , before we get into it uh too far , is i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .",15,0.5,0.5299572348594666
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.43536168336868286
1,0,"and uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that i 've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . um so i 've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ?",15,0.5,0.605371356010437
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.37815019488334656
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6125853657722473
1,0,"i thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that 's why i suggested we get in this .",15,0.5,0.5368854403495789
1,0,aye a fair point definitely .,15,0.5,0.5619251728057861
1,0,"okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .",15,0.5,0.5212938785552979
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.46563720703125
0,0,"um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , i think , creative about it . number two was that it be innovative . okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology . so it i 'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that i think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .",15,0.5,0.49965381622314453
1,0,aye right .,15,0.5,0.5531511902809143
1,0,"for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what i mean , like , or it 's got something else to it that just seems innovative",15,0.5,0.5065619945526123
0,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.4578351676464081
0,0,because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use . so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? well that 's i guess where we 're gon na go with this .,15,0.5,0.46146953105926514
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.44004809856414795
1,0,"okay then there 's the other aspect of the back the the market um research i have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we 've agreed is a priority . uh top european fashion trend um that i read about says there 's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay ,",15,0.5,0.5385297536849976
0,0,"especially in clothes and furniture . and when i first saw that i thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it ,",15,0.5,0.3331429362297058
0,0,okay okay .,15,0.5,0.474833607673645
1,0,"do you know what i mean ? so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . um 'cause i think what we 're in what we 're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um so i think we might wan na be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something ,",15,0.5,0.5705037117004395
1,0,i think that would be pushing it .,15,0.5,0.5635068416595459
1,0,"and then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . so um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year 's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , i think that 'll be in our favour . um so these this is the summary of everything . um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we 're selling to . uh innovative design technology 's also a must in that it 's seen it 'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . that was like the number three thing . and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that 's the way i interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so i 've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , mac ipods ,",15,0.5,0.5264880061149597
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5187210440635681
0,0,"something which is , i 'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there 's like no buttons .",15,0.5,0.39431536197662354
1,0,"mm that 's true , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5014669299125671
1,0,"you know what a mac ipod is ? i 'm thinking however mac ipod is sort of last year 's because it 's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so i 'm thinking if we imagine that we 're taking some of the features of a mac ipod and we 're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . um and then so this is w with all that information what i 'm what i 'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . sort of like a i dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . um does that make sense ? yeah . so so like i threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , i dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it 's just an idea , 'cause i 'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .",15,0.5,0.59979647397995
0,0,mm 'kay . great .,15,0.5,0.3973940312862396
1,0,"like um the ones the ones which i 'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . like i see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and",15,0.5,0.5226242542266846
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4634542465209961
1,0,so anyway it 's just just an idea .,15,0.5,0.5438634753227234
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5228891372680664
1,0,"i 'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up .",15,0.5,0.5822797417640686
0,0,ah .,15,0.5,0.296703964471817
1,0,how can we build on that ? maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so .,15,0.5,0.5637218952178955
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.44028133153915405
1,0,"anyway those are that 's all i have ,",15,0.5,0.5346046686172485
1,0,that 's great .,15,0.5,0.5019288659095764
1,0,but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into,15,0.5,0.5628699064254761
1,0,uh-huh . okay great .,15,0.5,0.5629324316978455
1,0,um thank you for that . uh craig do you wan na,15,0.5,0.5805896520614624
0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.35495099425315857
1,0,uh plug yours in then ?,15,0.5,0.6849493980407715
1,0,is it working ?,15,0.5,0.5609109997749329
0,0,mm . not quite .,15,0.5,0.4135746955871582
1,0,did you press f_ eight ?,15,0.5,0.52760249376297
1,0,it 's probably not sending . yeah .,15,0.5,0.554509699344635
1,0,"oh something coming now , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5909565687179565
1,0,"yep , there it is .",15,0.5,0.5040326118469238
0,0,there we go .,15,0.5,0.49986186623573303
1,0,"and so think of this concept . um to research it i 've um had a look on the the homepage again . it 's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . um there 's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so i 've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um so then this we 're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .",15,0.5,0.5432369112968445
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.35533806681632996
1,0,"um what i found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . um they 're not very attractive to look at , and they 're not very comfortable to hold , they 're i just hold 'em like big bricks , and they 're very easily lost . um they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you ca n't really see them .",15,0.5,0.552374541759491
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4930448532104492
0,0,"um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . um for instance , the stand-by button is n't always red , uh it really should be . it 's uh something the user then uh identify with . this is a red switch off , that 's how it should be . um i 'm not sure if there 's any other examples of that , but something to look out for . um there 's a problem that i 've i 've got couple of preferences for the the end control um i get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that um the buttons should be large . they should n't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . they should be easy to press , very comfortable . um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there 's an up and down volume button but both of them have a v_ on them ,",15,0.5,0.4881356954574585
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5682559013366699
0,0,"so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that 's kinda confusing . um should avoid s things like that . um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .",15,0.5,0.38775306940078735
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6165502071380615

0,0,"yeah . okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ?",15,0.5,0.4807271361351013
1,0,i think it 's yellow,15,0.5,0.5946844816207886
0,0,i did n't know .,15,0.5,0.4878288507461548

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5302988290786743
0,0,and the play-doh 's yellow .,15,0.5,0.45440730452537537
1,0,"so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there ,",15,0.5,0.580704391002655

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5517252683639526
1,0,"any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they should n't be on the um should n't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort .",15,0.5,0.6165923476219177
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.40505680441856384
1,0,"um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody 's voice , maybe they got a cold or um we should definitely avoid the big square block look . that 's just wrong .",15,0.5,0.6119939088821411

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3315972685813904

1,0,"yeah that that was very good ,",15,0.5,0.7065766453742981
1,1,well we 've made our prototype anyway . we can have a good look at that .,15,0.5,0.5428310036659241
0,0,you pass it round to have a look .,15,0.5,0.44733861088752747

1,0,mm very nice .,15,0.5,0.5298889875411987

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5743446350097656
1,0,"it 's a bit more fun , is n't it ? and it 's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac .",15,0.5,0.5867303013801575
1,0,"yeah , yeah , we might get a",15,0.5,0.5391674637794495

0,0,"oh , okay . right .",15,0.5,0.4665517508983612
1,0,it it 'd probably have to be labelled mute .,15,0.5,0.5531036257743835
1,0,they 're thinking,15,0.5,0.5061479210853577
1,0,"but um , we did n't have anything small enough to write .",15,0.5,0.5088773965835571
0,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.4451477527618408
0,0,"for the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons .",15,0.5,0.4937722682952881
1,0,okay . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5130508542060852
1,0,"yeah . uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them .",15,0.5,0.5328429937362671
1,0,"um , the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them a bit bigger . the mute could possibly be a bit smaller .",15,0.5,0.5169988870620728
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6201092004776001
0,0,"hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you 've got the volume in orange on design there ,",15,0.5,0.41759103536605835
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.658534824848175
1,0,and the the channel is in blue .,15,0.5,0.5593976378440857
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5800702571868896
1,0,"r right . um ,",15,0.5,0.5203069448471069
0,0,"yeah , and we chose a v_ plus and v_ minus .",15,0.5,0.47598201036453247
1,0,"all these things have cost implications . and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . so however , i 've now . but um , yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that ,",15,0.5,0.5422105193138123
1,0,i 'll see if i can find them .,15,0.5,0.5789206027984619
0,0,"and uh as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , i suppose .",15,0.5,0.4358349144458771
1,0,"yeah , sis",15,0.5,0.6988763213157654
0,0,"well the colours would n't like that 's they would n't be too important ,",15,0.5,0.4536280632019043
1,0,have,15,0.5,0.6645082235336304
0,0,but we did n't have any white play-doh . so that 's where the colour buttons came from .,15,0.5,0.3602941036224365
1,0,an important consideration .,15,0.5,0.5982733964920044
1,0,"right , okay so um and the second one underneath would be the idea for the",15,0.5,0.5318353772163391
1,0,"yes , we 'll have the slide-away .",15,0.5,0.5633567571640015
0,0,"right , okay . so we 've got um detail design meeting .",15,0.5,0.47882041335105896
1,0,bottom .,15,0.5,0.7045467495918274
0,0,"right . so so , we 've got prototype presentation , which we 've just done , evaluation criteria , um and finance , so i guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we 're looking for uh from um our previous meeting .",15,0.5,0.447700560092926
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5552259087562561
1,0,"so other than the fact that it does n't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would .",15,0.5,0.5723588466644287
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.49582070112228394
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5260905027389526
0,0,"but other than that , we got the red apple . we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons ,",15,0.5,0.47186732292175293
1,0,"yes , yes .",15,0.5,0.6472961902618408
0,0,and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . and the and the cost implication .,15,0.5,0.4228528141975403
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6438634991645813
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5616328120231628
0,0,"the only snag about this is that uh the cost is probably kind of important . so um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture .",15,0.5,0.46285074949264526
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6680358648300171
1,0,"um , and whether it would uh",15,0.5,0.593105137348175
1,0,so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?,15,0.5,0.5350073575973511
1,0,this this is a,15,0.5,0.556439220905304
1,0,"uh , that 's it .",15,0.5,0.6142026782035828
0,0,"yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .",15,0.5,0.49601852893829346
1,0,that 's the pr,15,0.5,0.6434629559516907
0,0,"right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half euros .",15,0.5,0.4635821580886841
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5019924640655518
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4831903278827667
1,0,"so , there 's no redesign . so that should uh right , so , seems to me that the thing that i have to do is is quickly find that uh",15,0.5,0.551178514957428
1,0,could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?,15,0.5,0.5199286341667175
0,0,we should plug it in .,15,0.5,0.49243980646133423
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.4325440227985382
1,0,do you wan na plu do you wan na plug it in into the the back of that one .,15,0.5,0.5683286786079407
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4094245731830597
1,0,"'kay , alice . so , sh",15,0.5,0.6120163202285767
1,0,"we could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .",15,0.5,0.5072625279426575
1,0,right . .,15,0.5,0.5682248473167419
1,0,'kay this should be then .,15,0.5,0.5412357449531555
1,0,"okay , so , by the fact that we 've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we 've got a single curved case . we 've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we 're having rubber buttons and",15,0.5,0.5154577493667603
0,0,mm-hmm . have a push button interface .,15,0.5,0.3568974733352661
1,0,okay . w the button supplements .,15,0.5,0.5755094289779663
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.5836213827133179
1,0,"well , originally , i thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . but",15,0.5,0.6269298195838928
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.4825185537338257
1,0,so the so the real w the real question then would come in . do you make all the buttons,15,0.5,0.5806193351745605
1,0,"well do we 'll do it on the prototype ,",15,0.5,0.5499736666679382
1,0,o,15,0.5,0.5538581013679504
1,0,"so do two , see how much it is .",15,0.5,0.5503983497619629
0,0,"well , so we 've got one special button form , which was the apple . everything else is gon na be a standard .",15,0.5,0.4813484847545624
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.507046639919281
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7455739378929138
1,0,"we 've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,",15,0.5,0.518642008304596
1,0,and then we 'd have,15,0.5,0.5554260611534119
0,0,"so , i was originally , i was thinking rubber was n't special ,",15,0.5,0.4847167730331421
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.41788116097450256
1,0,"but according to this , maybe it is .",15,0.5,0.5802369117736816
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5176680088043213
0,0,so and the r i mean effectively we 've got sixteen buttons that we 're gon na have on there .,15,0.5,0.4351074993610382
1,0,"yeah . i think you just do one , do n't you , for the",15,0.5,0.6028457283973694
1,0,"w i do n't know is is is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore i mean , what 's the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore",15,0.5,0.5068903565406799
1,0,i think i think it 's just it 's just a one . else,15,0.5,0.5272073149681091
1,0,"whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .",15,0.5,0.5100724101066589
0,0,"i thi i think i think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .",15,0.5,0.49372225999832153
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4556407332420349
1,0,i do n't know though .,15,0.5,0.6194917559623718
1,0,"i would every design change is uh sound ] i dunno ,",15,0.5,0.5487915277481079
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.36466512084007263
1,0,"um okay , um , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , i guess . we 'd have one special colour and one special button form .",15,0.5,0.5878632664680481
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.42996057868003845
1,0,"and when i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . as far as i know , that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements .",15,0.5,0.6279109716415405
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4214906394481659
0,0,and if what happened ?,15,0.5,0.4702424108982086
1,0,you 've just gone off the window into another one . it 's on the bottom row .,15,0.5,0.5783843994140625
1,0,maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box .,15,0.5,0.5124866366386414
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5296297073364258
0,0,"now , right .",15,0.5,0.48172318935394287
1,0,"okay , so , but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .",15,0.5,0.5553128123283386
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.510529637336731
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5305007100105286
1,0,so that 's nine point one there so we 've got some,15,0.5,0.5554351806640625
1,0,"so it well , is it s is no , it 's nine point seven i 've got .",15,0.5,0.5721383094787598
1,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.5096758604049683

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5829998254776001
1,0,just give us a bit of,15,0.5,0.5656676888465881
1,0,"so , that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine .",15,0.5,0.5436514616012573
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4427909851074219
1,0,and there 's nothing else as far as i can see that we we had uh planned to put on .,15,0.5,0.5179290175437927
1,0,s,15,0.5,0.6357412338256836

1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.5308456420898438
1,0,"um , i guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ?",15,0.5,0.6051859259605408
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.374102383852005
1,0,"we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech",15,0.5,0.5364990830421448
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.46656545996665955
1,0,"well , hold on . um , if we okay , that gives us twelve point seven",15,0.5,0.5737714171409607
1,0,"so uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition",15,0.5,0.5115625262260437
0,0,but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the,15,0.5,0.4709666967391968
1,0,without,15,0.5,0.5714175701141357
0,0,"oh , i see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and",15,0.5,0.449655145406723
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6942886114120483
0,0,"um , . d would n't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? you know how you turn that one to a zero , would n't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,",15,0.5,0.46094268560409546
1,0,"yeah , we have to have it",15,0.5,0.6156454682350159
1,0,"oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe .",15,0.5,0.5561723113059998
0,0,so you need both of them ?,15,0.5,0.49893617630004883
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6403579711914062
0,0,maybe um we 'd be giving up on the kinetic . um,15,0.5,0.44196924567222595
1,0,and go for battery instead .,15,0.5,0.6221585273742676
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3776363730430603
0,0,that would give you one less .,15,0.5,0.3993130922317505
0,0,"we should yeah , that would save us one , though we 'd still be slightly ov",15,0.5,0.3827216327190399
1,0,but you reckon that i i mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .,15,0.5,0.6392844319343567
0,0,"yeah , yeah . well , since it 's the through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . um , whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have .",15,0.5,0.4220675826072693
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.32168200612068176
1,0,"and then still have the batteries ,",15,0.5,0.6265978813171387
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3596831262111664
1,0,or whatever they would prefer not uh you know what i mean ? the the problem was the battery 's running out and losing the um losing the remote .,15,0.5,0.5644897818565369
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4515312910079956
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5097395777702332
1,0,so you got ta decide which of those is more important to them .,15,0.5,0.598699152469635
0,0,"but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? in a sense , at the moment , we 've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .",15,0.5,0.4031469225883484
1,0,i think the voice recognition .,15,0.5,0.6709351539611816
0,0,"at least . remember that was a minimum requirement . the other option if we 're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it originally , we 're gon na make it a simple product .",15,0.5,0.42939528822898865
0,1,"uh it fell off . one , two , three , four , yeah , we 're ready . okay . welcome to this second meeting . um it 's now quarter after twelve and we 're given forty minutes um for this meeting . this is a meeting on functional design . um and i wan na welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . um i did took the minutes from the first meeting and i 'll show them to you in a moment . um i know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , i thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there 's i happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . okay ? is this ap everybody agree with this ?",15,0.5,0.47370389103889465

1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.6566219329833984
1,0,"okay . um and after the meeting there 'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting . and go to that one . um as you can see it was this earlier today . um kate , steph , sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . i opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese . and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting anybody have any questions on those minutes ? are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 'kay .",15,0.5,0.5744600892066956

1,0,"okay , i accept the minutes .",15,0.5,0.6361475586891174
1,0,but i did n't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . so um as a group i think we 've are they 're accepting the minutes . and uh okay .,15,0.5,0.5510148406028748
1,0,is that what we 're supposed to say ?,15,0.5,0.5274348855018616

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5751750469207764

0,0,"oy , big loop under the table .",15,0.5,0.4333215653896332
0,0,she said we did n't need to screw it in .,15,0.5,0.4576835036277771
0,0,"okay . okay , that looks good .",15,0.5,0.4355231523513794
1,0,it 's doing its thing . there we are .,15,0.5,0.5668195486068726
0,0,"alright . thank you very much . um . one of the the biggest issues i found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and i think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . so um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . and if we devote some energy into this , i think the um recent productions of real reaction , the i go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , i think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . and um in fact i think the high definition d_v_d_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool . so again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . um fifty percent i think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . and eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , d_v_d_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .",15,0.5,0.4069713056087494
0,0,"could can i ask where these figures come from , is this market research we 've",15,0.5,0.4028984010219574
1,0,"um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money .",15,0.5,0.5362793803215027
0,0,"now in between , as the project manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be",15,0.5,0.32539743185043335

1,0,um that teletext is outdated um,15,0.5,0.5090530514717102
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5465216040611267
1,0,"and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for t_v_ um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .",15,0.5,0.5010784864425659
1,0,"mm-hmm . well i think we can i i think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the real reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly do n't um advertise for the i go everywhere line .",15,0.5,0.5908715724945068
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.36770233511924744
1,0,so an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . so these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology,15,0.5,0.6660340428352356
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.2400985211133957

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.3201954960823059
1,0,"now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . very interesting , i i leave this up to the group to decide if we wan na use this uh if and you know , the the designers ,",15,0.5,0.6306507587432861

0,0,is that a large enough target market to target it ?,15,0.5,0.41355445981025696
1,0,"well , i i i think especially in terms of growth , i think this would be a very smart group to target . i mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh",15,0.5,0.5267793536186218
1,0,"in real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?",15,0.5,0.5306339859962463

1,0,or eight million .,15,0.5,0.6193992495536804
1,0,yes . but would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did i know that it was it was an,15,0.5,0.5737963914871216

0,0,"exactly . i mean i i i uh did not receive any information on that , but i think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what 's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an l_c_d_ screen and and that was n't responded to , but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the osbournes where ozzy osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray .",15,0.5,0.4447028338909149

1,0,"that ? right , technical functions design . uh well i think first off , basically i do agree with what sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences , yeah . i think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . so my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . if we can build on this with the speech recognition , that 's not something i 'd thought about at all , but it 's also something we can discuss .",15,0.5,0.5792023539543152
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.44841548800468445

0,0,t_v_ only .,15,0.5,0.32497939467430115
1,0,so these are two models of existing remote controls . uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control .,15,0.5,0.5642642378807068
0,0,ugh .,15,0.5,0.3841427266597748
1,0,"it has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . it also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you 'd expect from a , you know , like a sky or cable remote control",15,0.5,0.6398253440856934
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.37008699774742126
1,0,"where you 've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . uh but i think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , i do n't think we need them at all . i think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and i think an an enter function where you can access it 's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that 'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .",15,0.5,0.6870242953300476

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5760732293128967

1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.51394122838974
0,0,uh but then i do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility .,15,0.5,0.4825628399848938
1,0,okay . any uh thing else you wan na add ?,15,0.5,0.5394282937049866

1,0,"still , i 'll do without that . okay um , now i wan na bring us down to earth again i 'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . um oh and this is the methodology i used in preparing for this meeting . um basically i 've been doing a little bit of web-based research , and if i had a design team , i would 've been discussing my ideas with 'em . but the the net result is that i 've come up with a first cut for the working design that i 'd like to discuss with you . so , let 's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . it 's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . and the the basic components we 've got to build in for our twelve euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . now i would have hoped i think that 's my only slide actually , yeah . i would have have hoped to um do you a pretty powerpoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you 'll bear with me i 'll do it on the whiteboard . so we want an energy source which is there . and we 've got to think about what that might be .",15,0.5,0.5339190363883972

1,0,"uh we obviously do n't want wires on this thing . uh typically it would be a battery , but i 'm open to suggestions . um and then we have the the user interface . oops . and the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . so those are the basic things that we 've got to get in for our twelve euros fifty . thank you .",15,0.5,0.5144367814064026

1,0,"um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . um and our marketing expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . people thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons .",15,0.5,0.5892698764801025

0,0,yep . can i have your cable please ?,15,0.5,0.40338921546936035
1,0,i suppose that you can have this .,15,0.5,0.5007853507995605
1,0,"thanks . okay so i was looking at trend-watching . um unfortunately i was n't given too much information . i was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . and then i 'll just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that . um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which i think we 've kind of already discussed before . um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . and again these are all things we 've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . and thirdly the remote would be easy to use . as far as fashion update , we 've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .",15,0.5,0.5473102927207947
1,0,"so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . okay so from that um , as we 've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . um i think we 've already discovered that it 's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . but i think that , even if it 's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they 're getting something that 's new and modern and sleek and whether it 's through the shape or the colours or all of that . um for technologically innovative , we 've talked about the tracking device . we brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . and manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . we need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which i think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . i do n't know , i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable .",15,0.5,0.5085611939430237

0,0,oh it was sort of banana shaped .,15,0.5,0.4638061821460724
1,0,"yeah . yeah . right . or with exterior designs . but my question is , i mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and i 'm not sure how they 'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside .",15,0.5,0.5225560069084167
0,0,"so maybe we could have something that 's somewhat removable , or i do n't know , different options for female , male target groups . and then the spongy feel . i guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that 's out there . c and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . so that 's that .",15,0.5,0.4733492434024811

0,0,"okay . why ca n't i see the crazy . um yeah i talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . um so i 've looked at some of the stuff i was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . um i was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . they gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . um okay . there 's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . um there 's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . a command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . um and then it ju that 's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . you ca n't really see that picture well , but there 's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated .",15,0.5,0.49449172616004944
1,0,"so , then i had a look at new products that are on the market . not necessarily remote controls but ones that you 'll recognise . um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . i have a there is a picture . you surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ and audio . and you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . so the technology is there . um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . you can sort of just make those out . and then on the right is obviously an ipod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . that is a possibility . and nothing 's simpler really . um then there 's things like this , which is a a a kid 's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . so the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . and um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . so i do n't know if there 's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a v_ for volume . just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . um i think , d carrying on from what i 've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . maybe we 've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . and then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . um i do n't it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus . stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . and then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . and that is it . why am i oh yeah . just . where are we ? uh . just to sort of show you . m they 've even got things like that .",15,0.5,0.5029506087303162

1,0,"'kay . my name is freek van ponnen . i 'm the market expert . but you already knew that . um i 've done some research . we have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . we had one hundred of these uh test subjects . uh in addition we did some market research . uh see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . well these are three quite astonishing results , i thought . um remotes are being considered ugly . f uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . so um in addition remotes were not very functional . fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . so",15,0.5,0.6209352016448975
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.23135687410831451
1,0,"some things . then we did some research to the most relevant functions . channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . the power button got a nine . and teletext got a six and a half . so these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . then there are some one-time use function . that 's what i like to call them . that uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . then these are the this is the market . um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . um main characteristic of this group is that they 're very critical on the remote control . um they like to use new f new functions . but they also are very critical . they wo n't spend their money very easily . so um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . they are not really very interested in features . but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . what i think this indicates for our um design . i think we should make a remote for the future . and this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . um the results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s_ r_s_i_ . um this is certainly something to take into account . and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design . besides of course that the remote must look very nice . and the functionality as a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , i think we should make very few buttons . uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . uh i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'cause they 're used most and so they should be robust . they should n't break down easily . um then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and i say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . and this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . so you 'd know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an l_c_d_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but up till forty five it remains feasible . this would also greatly increase the production costs but i think these are just some small factors we could consider .",15,0.5,0.545848548412323

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.517152726650238
1,0,i think it 's going to uh it 's not too much . okay .,15,0.5,0.6115584969520569
1,0,"okay i 've got a presentation about the working design . um first about how it works . it 's really simple of course . everybody knows how a remote works . the user presses a button . the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v_ . the t_v_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . so we 've got um the the plate . it gots conductive disks for every button . when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v_ . it 's a very simple device , technically speaking . so this is a schematic overview . you 've got the buttons . the power source . and uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . the chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . well um i think we should use default materials , simple plastics . keep the inner workings simple , so it 's robust . uh i think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you 're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . and uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . so it 's , in my idea , it 's uh it 's gon na be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . that 's it .",15,0.5,0.6107051372528076

0,0,uh okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . um i 'm the project manager so i 'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements .,15,0.5,0.4061184823513031

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5500258207321167

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.386519193649292
0,0,"uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . and uh it 's a function we do n't need in our remote control .",15,0.5,0.4519469439983368
0,0,"um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . uh that 's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . um this is uh a bit pity for the marketing uh expert .",15,0.5,0.4004565477371216
1,0,"because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . so we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . so i suggest let 's have a discussion on the control functions . yeah .",15,0.5,0.6756097078323364
1,0,so is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?,15,0.5,0.5285923480987549

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.31085941195487976
1,0,yeah 'cause you 're you 're saying that teletext is gon na be an old feature and it 's not gon na be used anymore anyway pretty soon . and new t_v_s will have internet access on them .,15,0.5,0.7154170870780945

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3355250060558319

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.362947553396225
1,0,"and um if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it 's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .",15,0.5,0.5940265655517578
0,0,yes but it 's not the biggest part of the market .,15,0.5,0.4650840163230896
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.34933626651763916
1,0,"and besides that , they 're not very critical so i mean they do n't really care what the remote control is like . they 'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .",15,0.5,0.5353277921676636
0,0,"but do n't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that 's the the device i 've looked for although i did n't realise it .",15,0.5,0.487640380859375
0,0,so let 's try it .,15,0.5,0.28159406781196594
1,0,no . i think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control .,15,0.5,0.5514845848083496
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3720758259296417

1,0,yeah . it 's a big success .,15,0.5,0.5273497104644775

1,0,yeah . uh . i think so as well .,15,0.5,0.5751663446426392

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4937569200992584
1,0,"we do n't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . we just change our focus on the project , and i think we can uh we can sell this .",15,0.5,0.6117468476295471
0,0,uh i simply think um,15,0.5,0.45917457342147827
1,1,"and t s simplest approach that i came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . i mean that 's an obvious thing to say , but it 's not attached to the device that you want to control . um i had some things sent to me . not very much . to look at similar devices . um defined in some them . and then the personal preferences that i will suggest . um we discussed a universal one . um like it 's just been brought up again then . but i think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you 'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . i 'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to i they 're a nightmare to use . you have to set them , reset them to everything . um and that would only add buttons . whereas i think the aim is to take away buttons . so i think it 'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for t_v_s . um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that 's unique in design . um okay here here 's just two pictures of remote controls . they 're just simple t_v_ remote controls . but one is uh user-centred . that is the one on the left . and you can straight away see there 's less buttons . and the other one is engineer-centred where that 's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it 's trying to control um which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred . fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what 's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they 're hidden away . and the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . um and finally , um uh sort i 've sort of covered that , our product i think should be user interface orientated . um like i said to concentrate on t_v_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . um and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it 's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . and that 's it .",15,0.5,0.7348899841308594
0,0,cable there . thank you .,15,0.5,0.39437898993492126
0,0,what was your last conclusion on that one ? focus on uh the i,15,0.5,0.443446546792984

1,0,'kay . good . good .,15,0.5,0.6314685344696045
0,0,"okay . gon na talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . right . so unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it ,",15,0.5,0.47784852981567383
1,0,"so um i 'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . um just this is the basic basic premise of a remote control . um the basic function is to send messages to another system . okay so much is clear . an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . often in the form of infrared bits . this is the most mostly used . um there 's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . um parts are cheaper as well . a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . this is where my people screwed up basically .",15,0.5,0.5098684430122375
0,0,"so i 'm going to explain that on the board rather . um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . we 'll start with an energy source . right . um which is usually a battery right ? since it 's not feasible to add a cable to that . this energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself . uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . right ? this is the user interface and there we have the chip . um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . that sends out the signal . of course the signal differs accordingly . um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . and of course that 's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . the way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it 's working basically . you press something , you get a response . which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . now this , what we 're talking about here , or what i think should be discussed are these two components mostly . the the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . what we probably can not alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . we can not change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . right ? these two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . it c it does n't have to be there . this can be discussed as well . the user interface . that 's something we can also discuss . um as we 've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . speech recognition um interface , we do n't know that . or if we just do the usual button thing . or we have a touch pad or something like that that 's something we can discuss . and of course the energy source . batteries . solar cells . who knows ? of course it 's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough , developed enough . but that 's like i s i suppose rather up to marketing , and not to",15,0.5,0.4859240651130676

0,0,expensive it 's gon na be get uh . yeah .,15,0.5,0.3037624955177307
1,0,but people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote .,15,0.5,0.7049517631530762
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.24451935291290283
1,0,so possibly it might be worth the investment .,15,0.5,0.6221553683280945
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.29479068517684937
1,0,i think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 'cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it 's on your phone .,15,0.5,0.643073558807373
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4165695607662201
0,0,i agree . well,15,0.5,0.48941531777381897
1,0,and you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects i suppose as well .,15,0.5,0.5317544937133789
0,0,"i myself i find , when you , h when there 's something like spee speech recognition . like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end ,",15,0.5,0.48907583951950073
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.33121564984321594
1,0,"and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . i find myself , especially if i 'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly .",15,0.5,0.6563060879707336

1,0,"another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they 'd do it , but probably a lot of them that 's actually their parents money . like i do n't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know .",15,0.5,0.6557440757751465

1,0,okay . um let 's see here .,15,0.5,0.6173129677772522
0,0,do you wan na put your cord back in ?,15,0.5,0.44995391368865967
1,0,yeah i guess so .,15,0.5,0.5655969977378845
1,0,oh right .,15,0.5,0.5495593547821045

0,0,go .,15,0.5,0.38915371894836426
1,0,"now i was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . um the remote 's only gon na be for the television , which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it 's more cost , more costly . and your re uh research showed that you know most of the people do n't even use it . i think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons .",15,0.5,0.6506029963493347

0,0,"i did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wan na call it . um that you you should put it back in . your remote . but if you do n't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . just by infrared . that should n't be too complex i would 've thought .",15,0.5,0.47944876551628113

1,0,so i found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors,15,0.5,0.539868175983429
1,0,so can you,15,0.5,0.6884689331054688
0,0,this are usual functionality .,15,0.5,0.47400999069213867
1,0,"yeah , yeah , yeah . ours is a bit uh different . so these are two example . one is from the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah .",15,0.5,0.535895824432373
1,0,tasks .,15,0.5,0.5981047749519348
0,0,this is the most competing prototypes i 've found .,15,0.5,0.4393403232097626
0,0,but then uh loo but then i found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons,15,0.5,0.4360540807247162
1,0,and they are small .,15,0.5,0.5877785086631775
0,0,yeah . o on the right i tried to play with the problem is that uh if i have hundred channels i have uh i have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and i have to compose the number,15,0.5,0.43859636783599854
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6694490313529968
1,0,so it 's very lousy .,15,0.5,0.5572411417961121
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5002483129501343
0,0,so you so you move to the next the next one .,15,0.5,0.40690308809280396
1,0,of course .,15,0.5,0.6362887620925903
0,0,"yeah , so i talk about the problem . and then i i look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we do n't want that .",15,0.5,0.4094234108924866
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5297803282737732
0,0,"so i propose the easy to use uh prototype . you can navigate on t_v_ screen and we can the user 's preference and we need to have the t_v_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the t_v_ programmes by x_m_l_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . from the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the t_v_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ?",15,0.5,0.4386695325374603
1,0,and then we the speech recognition as uh harry says we may just put in we may k_i_v_ .,15,0.5,0.6472317576408386
0,0,what do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the t_v_,15,0.5,0.4324789047241211
0,0,"yeah , all the processing is done the t_v_ is a compu has some processing power the",15,0.5,0.46617022156715393
1,0,than the,15,0.5,0.5593881607055664
1,0,so we have to t,15,0.5,0.5266212224960327
0,0,so we should have specific t_v_ ? or ? we can use this .,15,0.5,0.49873778223991394
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.47685641050338745
1,0,we have to sell a t_v_ with the remote control too .,15,0.5,0.6287742853164673
0,0,"yeah , we do n't",15,0.5,0.3572659194469452
1,0,yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay .,15,0.5,0.5511413216590881
1,0,"yeah , i think so . j j just the remote control .",15,0.5,0.5877388119697571
1,0,"yeah , not the t_v_s .",15,0.5,0.5088499784469604
0,0,i think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the t_v_ set on recorders or thing like that,15,0.5,0.48989859223365784
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4766432046890259
1,0,and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because,15,0.5,0.5740090608596802
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4035303294658661
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5280306935310364
1,0,yeah . okay .,15,0.5,0.571247935295105
1,0,"yeah , that 's right .",15,0.5,0.6068214774131775
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.41268599033355713
1,0,so i the processing on on the remote controller,15,0.5,0.584968090057373
0,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.48759639263153076
1,0,"so it can u be used in any t_v_ , any conventional t_v_ sets ?",15,0.5,0.5393825769424438
0,0,we . yeah .,15,0.5,0.43527764081954956
0,0,mm . okay .,15,0.5,0.3372081518173218
1,0,speech recognition .,15,0.5,0.6806206107139587
0,0,"n yeah , that 's all . the next one ? so i come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons .",15,0.5,0.33369266986846924
1,0,"yes , that 's a good idea , i think .",15,0.5,0.534862756729126
1,0,keep the navigation,15,0.5,0.5739147067070007
0,0,we d we do n't we we do n't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the t_v_ so uh,15,0.5,0.4036152958869934
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5454745292663574
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5997138619422913
0,0,"well , f four five buttons , it 's sufficient .",15,0.5,0.4338437020778656
1,0,yeah . mm .,15,0.5,0.5119040012359619
1,0,"it 's easy to build ,",15,0.5,0.5723334550857544
0,0,it does not consume much power .,15,0.5,0.38633137941360474
1,0,"yeah , that 's right .",15,0.5,0.605152428150177
0,0,.,15,0.5,0.48622825741767883
1,0,"okay , that 's all .",15,0.5,0.5432950258255005
1,0,"oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then .",15,0.5,0.5593313574790955
0,0,"well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel",15,0.5,0.494567334651947
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.44386085867881775
1,0,and then uh you can,15,0.5,0.5865210294723511
0,0,"mm . no , because you choose by channel , so you choose by t_v_ program",15,0.5,0.3934876024723053
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6091917157173157
1,0,uh-huh huh huh huh .,15,0.5,0.5403563976287842
1,0,maybe you,15,0.5,0.5147521495819092
1,0,"so you do n't have hundred channels to choose from . if you go by channel , you do n't have to do that .",15,0.5,0.5277420282363892
1,0,.,15,0.5,0.6397264003753662

1,0,but uh i i think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could,15,0.5,0.6384490132331848
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5837996006011963
1,0,so you are,15,0.5,0.5333224534988403

1,0,yeah then yeah that 's right .,15,0.5,0.556877613067627
1,0,a mouse or,15,0.5,0.5898111462593079
1,0,"well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down ,",15,0.5,0.5367891192436218
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5267232060432434
1,0,"well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or",15,0.5,0.5804082751274109
0,0,mm hmm hmm . okay .,15,0.5,0.3821093738079071

0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.34560492634773254
1,0,we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .,15,0.5,0.5450353026390076
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4517079293727875

0,0,then we shall start with a presentation from raj .,15,0.5,0.4592691659927368
1,0,"yeah . hi , me raj , again . uh in this meeting i i 'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology . the met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way we have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . so what are our findings ? in our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . so this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . so we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls .",15,0.5,0.6495655179023743
0,0,"the last one is the most important one , is it ?",15,0.5,0.3437338173389435
0,0,no the first one is the,15,0.5,0.41494715213775635
1,0,"oh , sorry .",15,0.5,0.7010393738746643
0,0,"uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook ,",15,0.5,0.38220739364624023
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5620585083961487
0,0,"the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good .",15,0.5,0.4037567377090454
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.43186724185943604
1,0,"the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . so it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that .",15,0.5,0.7259032726287842
0,0,"so that indicates our technological advancement . and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use ,",15,0.5,0.344727098941803
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4554324746131897
1,0,"like it should n't be too much co complicated ,",15,0.5,0.5267552733421326
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4346805512905121
1,0,"there should n't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it should n't be too complicated uh like this way . and it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . so that they could know how to use these remote controls . when we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that",15,0.5,0.5443066954612732
0,0,sorry .,15,0.5,0.45632392168045044
0,0,ah yeah ?,15,0.5,0.43667280673980713
1,0,i was just reading fruit and vegetables .,15,0.5,0.5454990267753601
0,0,hard to know how we are going to incorporate that .,15,0.5,0.4315252900123596
1,0,"y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables ,",15,0.5,0.5820306539535522
0,0,"because the g world is now changing it 's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic ,",15,0.5,0.3852621614933014
1,0,okay . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5168267488479614
1,0,"we should make a big sponge lemon ,",15,0.5,0.5940415859222412
0,0,becoming,15,0.5,0.4960092604160309

1,0,glow-in-the-dark . okay .,15,0.5,0.583212673664093
1,0,"and people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look .",15,0.5,0.5003678202629089

1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6686331033706665
1,0,that 's what we kind of predicted anyway .,15,0.5,0.527923583984375
0,0,so so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . so that should also be taken into consideration .,15,0.5,0.4989362955093384
1,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.5945388674736023

1,0,no it ca y a,15,0.5,0.6978394389152527
1,0,do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ?,15,0.5,0.7421592473983765
0,0,the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co,15,0.5,0.31766387820243835

1,0,"he 's also uh that 's about the new remote control . uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . first is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . after the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . i had some role indications on here . but i think you know it already by yourself . the industrial designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . uh the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation . so that 's a bit what you 're going to do . but that will be all worked out in uh other meetings .",15,0.5,0.6233369708061218
1,0,"then we 've got our first tool training . we are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it 's ab it 's handy if we have a little bit of training first . as you can see we 've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . um in the white board here there 's a little tool bar on this side . here are some functions . you can save . n uh these functions we do n't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . a blank new document for each person . uh select a pen , eraser . capture we do n't have to do anything with . uh then we 've got our pen . this pen . it 's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of .",15,0.5,0.5265452861785889
1,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.5917750000953674
1,0,you can also select the current colour and the line width . but then first you have to select the pen function .,15,0.5,0.5462273359298706
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.44529396295547485
1,0,"but we 're going to work with it in a minute . so okay . uh that 's very simple and it 's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there . uh then a short thing about documents . we 've got our shared folder , project project what was it ? project documents i think . but all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . and these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wan na show , just open it from the folder .",15,0.5,0.5641897320747375
1,0,okay . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6450091600418091
1,0,"here is a simple tool bar . it 's what i just said , it 's save , print , move back or forward one page . you can switch between the different drawings . and then we 're going to try out the white board .",15,0.5,0.5649479627609253
0,0,so as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it .,15,0.5,0.39034196734428406
1,0,mouse was n't running away .,15,0.5,0.6904148459434509
0,0,that was interesting .,15,0.5,0.4694100022315979

0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4716317355632782
1,0,we 're going to uh draw animal . and uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics .,15,0.5,0.5903536081314087
0,0,"um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width .",15,0.5,0.4984869360923767
1,0,"uh there 's i can start from now . i will . you can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing wo n't get good .",15,0.5,0.5055355429649353
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4612219035625458
1,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.6117651462554932
0,0,another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'cause if you 're going to draw like really fast then um the pen wo n't hold up . so we choose form of current colour uh i think grey is appropriate . then the line width . i think seven will be nice . now you 'll see my drawing capabilities .,15,0.5,0.45666420459747314
1,0,"these are not very much , but uh uh , see you have to do it real slow . oh",15,0.5,0.5083456039428711
1,0,sure .,15,0.5,0.555469274520874
0,0,"ah i was trying to draw a dolphin ,",15,0.5,0.4351993203163147

0,0,ah it 's okay .,15,0.5,0.49704909324645996
0,0,"and i 've got to write down a few of its characteristics . uh is they 've got no text tool , no . uh . okay .",15,0.5,0.4957864284515381
1,0,"this is typically a undo action , i think .",15,0.5,0.5472382307052612
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6573591232299805
0,0,"pen . maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . i think that 's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . but i do n't know , i 'm just trying . this is not my work ,",15,0.5,0.41135871410369873

1,0,"maybe it 's easier to draw the smaller line width , i think . because this is going a lot better than uh i did .",15,0.5,0.633296012878418

1,0,we 're being haunted .,15,0.5,0.5150632262229919
1,0,haunted white board . so we 've got the tool uh introduction . we move along to the project finance .,15,0.5,0.594325840473175
0,0,"um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five euros . our selling price . uh our profit aim is fifty million euros . uh that 's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . um but that 's all in the later stadium . our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half euros , so that 's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we wo n't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . it wo n't work . so just try to remember these points . selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we 're trying to focus on . and production cost uh maximal twelve and a half euros . so that 's leads us to our little discussion . we 've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . so i 'm gon na sit down , i think . it 's easier .",15,0.5,0.4400414228439331

0,0,ah yeah .,15,0.5,0.25518152117729187
1,0,and i think it 's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .,15,0.5,0.703380286693573
0,0,yep . yeah,15,0.5,0.30853864550590515
1,0,sure . yeah .,15,0.5,0.7060338258743286
0,0,"i 've i 've got one at home . and you can uh program i think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else .",15,0.5,0.44962191581726074
1,0,"okay , yeah . yeah .",15,0.5,0.6282015442848206
1,0,"and it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor .",15,0.5,0.5142749547958374
1,0,"okay , yeah .",15,0.5,0.571715235710144
0,0,oh,15,0.5,0.48717817664146423
1,0,so that 's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d_v_d_ player downstairs and you 've got a link to your t_v_ on the second floor . so that 's a pretty handy um,15,0.5,0.5503184199333191

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5212938785552979
1,0,"thing . um but only the i think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . it 's uh",15,0.5,0.6409999132156372
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.43129414319992065

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.48655030131340027
1,0,"uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . but i do n't know if that will exceed the production costs . so that uh that 's something we have to find out , i think .",15,0.5,0.5759662389755249
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.41403234004974365

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5794599652290344
1,0,no one drawing it .,15,0.5,0.556827962398529
0,0,it 's too beautiful .,15,0.5,0.49650871753692627
1,0,"yeah , true .",15,0.5,0.5766667723655701
1,0,uh i figured uh that much .,15,0.5,0.5660184025764465
1,0,too wicked .,15,0.5,0.5437644124031067
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4588015377521515
0,0,"a minute please , my uh laptop is uh oh , there it is , thank you . so welcome back . at the functional design meeting um the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . i will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that i have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards . um uh i had an email from the from the management board",15,0.5,0.48526841402053833
0,0,"uh , i do n't know if you a al also uh received it , but there were four points uh which uh i think are very important . first one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . uh second one is also important uh , because it 's one of the discussion points of the previous session . uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it uh not gon na it 's not gon na be a multi-purpose remote control , so uh that 's one thing to keep in mind .",15,0.5,0.49124157428741455
1,0,"uh second , and i think that 's important for the marketing uh expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . uh and uh i think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote .",15,0.5,0.5155277848243713
1,1,so is why not save that .,15,0.5,0.5078979134559631
1,0,"no , you 'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere .",15,0.5,0.5713662505149841
0,0,"do you want to replace existing file , no . i actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but",15,0.5,0.3829919099807739
1,0,"yeah , you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that 's the save one is n't it , so and then find it .",15,0.5,0.7263761162757874
0,0,spreadsheet .,15,0.5,0.47329145669937134
1,0,"yeah , but i 've ta uh",15,0.5,0.5617570281028748
1,0,"right , i 'll just re-do it . that 's the easiest way . right .",15,0.5,0.7223680019378662
1,0,well we 've made our prototype anyway . we can have a good look at that .,15,0.5,0.5089826583862305
0,0,you pass it round to have a look .,15,0.5,0.44733861088752747
0,0,"mm-hmm . y no , it 's a slightly curved around the sides .",15,0.5,0.4514322578907013
1,0,mm very nice .,15,0.5,0.5298889875411987
1,0,"um , it 's almost curved like up to the main display as well . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down .",15,0.5,0.5161656737327576
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5859788060188293
0,0,and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line .,15,0.5,0.4273754060268402
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5465900301933289
0,0,and we 've got the stick on the button with the company logo on .,15,0.5,0.4544990062713623
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6452634334564209
0,0,we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .,15,0.5,0.4933602213859558
1,0,"so it is , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6338270902633667
0,0,cherry would be alright actually .,15,0.5,0.4878119230270386
1,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.5776485800743103
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5743446350097656
1,0,"it 's a bit more fun , is n't it ? and it 's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac .",15,0.5,0.5867302417755127
1,0,"yeah , yeah , we might get a",15,0.5,0.5391674637794495
1,0,"mm-hmm . copyright , yeah . what 's this this one ?",15,0.5,0.5599452257156372
0,0,"yeah , and cherries are fun , summery .",15,0.5,0.49067309498786926
1,0,what 's that one there ?,15,0.5,0.5289117693901062
0,0,"ah , that 's the mute .",15,0.5,0.46197447180747986
1,0,for the m_ .,15,0.5,0.5025337338447571
0,0,"oh , okay . right .",15,0.5,0.4665517508983612
1,0,it it 'd probably have to be labelled mute .,15,0.5,0.5531036257743835
1,0,they 're thinking,15,0.5,0.5061479210853577
1,0,"but um , we did n't have anything small enough to write .",15,0.5,0.5088773965835571
0,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.39822372794151306
0,0,"for the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons .",15,0.5,0.4641009569168091
1,0,okay . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5130508542060852
1,0,"yeah . uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them .",15,0.5,0.5328429937362671
1,0,"um , the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them a bit bigger . the mute could possibly be a bit smaller .",15,0.5,0.5169988870620728
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6201092004776001
0,0,"hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you 've got the volume in orange on design there ,",15,0.5,0.41759103536605835
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.658534824848175
1,0,and the the channel is in blue .,15,0.5,0.5593976378440857
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5800702571868896
1,0,"r right . um ,",15,0.5,0.5203069448471069
0,0,"yeah , and we chose a v_ plus and v_ minus .",15,0.5,0.4759784936904907
1,0,"all these things have cost implications . and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . so however , i 've now . but um , yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that ,",15,0.5,0.5422121286392212
1,0,i 'll see if i can find them .,15,0.5,0.5789191126823425
0,0,"and uh as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , i suppose .",15,0.5,0.4358349144458771
1,0,"yeah , sis",15,0.5,0.6988763213157654
0,0,"well the colours would n't like that 's they would n't be too important ,",15,0.5,0.4536280035972595
1,0,have,15,0.5,0.6645082235336304
0,0,but we did n't have any white play-doh . so that 's where the colour buttons came from .,15,0.5,0.3602941036224365
1,0,an important consideration .,15,0.5,0.5982733964920044
1,0,"right , okay so um and the second one underneath would be the idea for the",15,0.5,0.5318353772163391
1,0,"yes , we 'll have the slide-away .",15,0.5,0.5633567571640015
0,0,"right , okay . so we 've got um detail design meeting .",15,0.5,0.47882041335105896
1,0,bottom .,15,0.5,0.7045442461967468
0,0,"right . so so , we 've got prototype presentation , which we 've just done , evaluation criteria , um and finance , so i guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we 're looking for uh from um our previous meeting .",15,0.5,0.4477016031742096
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5552292466163635
1,0,"so other than the fact that it does n't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would .",15,0.5,0.5723588466644287
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.49582070112228394
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5260904431343079
0,0,"but other than that , we got the red apple . we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons ,",15,0.5,0.4718673825263977
1,0,"yes , yes .",15,0.5,0.647296130657196
0,0,and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . and the and the cost implication .,15,0.5,0.4228528141975403
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6438634991645813
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5616327524185181
0,0,"the only snag about this is that uh the cost is probably kind of important . so um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture .",15,0.5,0.46285080909729004
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6680358052253723
1,0,"um , and whether it would uh",15,0.5,0.593105137348175
1,0,so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?,15,0.5,0.5350073575973511
1,0,this this is a,15,0.5,0.556439220905304
1,0,"uh , that 's it .",15,0.5,0.6142026782035828
0,0,"yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .",15,0.5,0.49601852893829346
1,0,that 's the pr,15,0.5,0.6434653401374817
0,0,"right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half euros .",15,0.5,0.4635894298553467
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5020009279251099
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4831903576850891
1,0,"so , there 's no redesign . so that should uh right , so , seems to me that the thing that i have to do is is quickly find that uh",15,0.5,0.5511784553527832
1,0,could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?,15,0.5,0.5199286937713623
0,0,we should plug it in .,15,0.5,0.49243980646133423
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.4325440227985382
1,0,do you wan na plu do you wan na plug it in into the the back of that one .,15,0.5,0.5683286786079407
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4094245731830597
1,0,"'kay , alice . so , sh",15,0.5,0.6120163202285767
1,0,"we could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .",15,0.5,0.5072625279426575
1,0,right . .,15,0.5,0.5682248473167419
1,0,'kay this should be then .,15,0.5,0.541236400604248
1,0,"okay , so , by the fact that we 've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we 've got a single curved case . we 've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we 're having rubber buttons and",15,0.5,0.5154575705528259
0,0,mm-hmm . have a push button interface .,15,0.5,0.3568985164165497
1,0,okay . w the button supplements .,15,0.5,0.5755094289779663
1,0,um,15,0.5,0.5836213827133179
1,0,"well , originally , i thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . but",15,0.5,0.6269298195838928
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.4825185537338257
1,0,so the so the real w the real question then would come in . do you make all the buttons,15,0.5,0.5806193351745605
1,0,"well do we 'll do it on the prototype ,",15,0.5,0.5499736666679382
1,0,o,15,0.5,0.5538581013679504
1,0,"so do two , see how much it is .",15,0.5,0.5503983497619629
0,0,"well , so we 've got one special button form , which was the apple . everything else is gon na be a standard .",15,0.5,0.4813484847545624
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.507046639919281
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7455739378929138
1,0,"we 've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,",15,0.5,0.518642008304596
1,0,and then we 'd have,15,0.5,0.5554260015487671
0,0,"so , i was originally , i was thinking rubber was n't special ,",15,0.5,0.4847167730331421
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4178811013698578
1,0,"but according to this , maybe it is .",15,0.5,0.5802369117736816
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5176679491996765
0,0,so and the r i mean effectively we 've got sixteen buttons that we 're gon na have on there .,15,0.5,0.4351074993610382
1,0,"yeah . i think you just do one , do n't you , for the",15,0.5,0.6028457283973694
1,0,"w i do n't know is is is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore i mean , what 's the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore",15,0.5,0.5068903565406799
1,0,i think i think it 's just it 's just a one . else,15,0.5,0.5272073149681091
1,0,"whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .",15,0.5,0.5100723505020142
0,0,"i thi i think i think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .",15,0.5,0.49372225999832153
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.45564067363739014
1,0,i do n't know though .,15,0.5,0.6194917559623718
1,0,"i would every design change is uh sound ] i dunno ,",15,0.5,0.5487915277481079
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.36466512084007263
1,0,"um okay , um , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , i guess . we 'd have one special colour and one special button form .",15,0.5,0.5878633260726929
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.42994949221611023
1,0,"and when i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . as far as i know , that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements .",15,0.5,0.6279208064079285
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4214751124382019
0,0,and if what happened ?,15,0.5,0.4702424108982086
1,0,you 've just gone off the window into another one . it 's on the bottom row .,15,0.5,0.5783843994140625
1,0,maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box .,15,0.5,0.5124866366386414
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5296297073364258
0,0,"now , right .",15,0.5,0.48172318935394287
1,0,"okay , so , but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .",15,0.5,0.5553128719329834
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.510529637336731
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5305007100105286
1,0,so that 's nine point one there so we 've got some,15,0.5,0.5554351210594177
1,0,"so it well , is it s is no , it 's nine point seven i 've got .",15,0.5,0.572138249874115
1,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.5096758604049683
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.45624658465385437
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5829998254776001
1,0,just give us a bit of,15,0.5,0.5656676888465881
1,0,"so , that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine .",15,0.5,0.5436514616012573
0,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4605621099472046
0,0,and there 's nothing else as far as i can see that we we had uh planned to put on .,15,0.5,0.494194358587265
1,0,s,15,0.5,0.6357457637786865
0,0,"i switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . at the moment we 've just got the simple chip , which costs one .",15,0.5,0.4900745451450348
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.5308155417442322
1,0,"um , i guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ?",15,0.5,0.6051836013793945
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3741031587123871
1,0,"we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech",15,0.5,0.5364990830421448
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.46656545996665955
1,0,"well , hold on . um , if we okay , that gives us twelve point seven",15,0.5,0.5737714171409607
1,0,"so uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition",15,0.5,0.5115625262260437
0,0,but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the,15,0.5,0.4709666967391968
1,0,without,15,0.5,0.5714175701141357
0,0,"oh , i see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and",15,0.5,0.449655145406723
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6942858695983887
0,0,"um , . d would n't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? you know how you turn that one to a zero , would n't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,",15,0.5,0.4609527587890625
1,0,"yeah , we have to have it",15,0.5,0.6156365275382996
1,0,"oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe .",15,0.5,0.5561723113059998
0,0,so you need both of them ?,15,0.5,0.49893617630004883
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.640358030796051
0,0,maybe um we 'd be giving up on the kinetic . um,15,0.5,0.44196924567222595
1,0,and go for battery instead .,15,0.5,0.6221585869789124
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4524753987789154
1,0,that would give you one less .,15,0.5,0.5575042366981506
0,0,"we should yeah , that would save us one , though we 'd still be slightly ov",15,0.5,0.3827216327190399
1,0,but you reckon that i i mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .,15,0.5,0.6392847299575806
0,0,"yeah , yeah . well , since it 's the through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . um , whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have .",15,0.5,0.42206740379333496
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3216821253299713
1,0,"and then still have the batteries ,",15,0.5,0.6265978813171387
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3596831262111664
1,0,or whatever they would prefer not uh you know what i mean ? the the problem was the battery 's running out and losing the um losing the remote .,15,0.5,0.5644897818565369
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4515312910079956
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5097395181655884
1,0,so you got ta decide which of those is more important to them .,15,0.5,0.598632276058197
0,0,"but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? in a sense , at the moment , we 've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .",15,0.5,0.40319302678108215
1,0,i think the voice recognition .,15,0.5,0.6709051728248596
0,0,"at least . remember that was a minimum requirement . the other option if we 're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it originally , we 're gon na make it a simple product .",15,0.5,0.3387411832809448
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.598488450050354
1,0,"shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we 've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?",15,0.5,0.6121097803115845
0,0,mm-hmm . makes sense .,15,0.5,0.4873798191547394
1,0,okay,15,0.5,0.5775972008705139
0,0,"okay . right um , i have a little thing . so , we 've all got a note of it 's thirteen point seven , is n't it , with everything we want on .",15,0.5,0.48887136578559875
1,0,". sorry , do you want that back up ?",15,0.5,0.6213763356208801
1,0,"yeah , i just had a presentation to do .",15,0.5,0.5371161103248596
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.47373834252357483
1,0,but i do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it 's got no battery .,15,0.5,0.5181263089179993
1,0,"okay , but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .",15,0.5,0.5503765940666199
0,0,"mm-hmm . mm . right okay um , this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we 've got here .",15,0.5,0.3068455457687378
1,0,"and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we 've formulated . and those ones are gon na be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , i guess . and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it 's neither true nor false , then that 's four . so , i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . um so , we have to say whether it 's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . um the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it 's easy to use . whether it 's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it 's a sort of recognisable real reaction product . and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently ,",15,0.5,0.5369563102722168
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6671817898750305
1,0,"so i 'll go over here . right . so the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . so if we do a sort of a one so",15,0.5,0.5417614579200745
0,0,"okay , well we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product 's quite good .",15,0.5,0.29374173283576965
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6918260455131531
0,0,so uh,15,0.5,0.48628902435302734
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.609919548034668
0,0,"um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time .",15,0.5,0.43148374557495117
1,0,yeah . yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5947362184524536
1,0,"um , sorry that 'd be considered fancy .",15,0.5,0.59723961353302
1,0,"yeah , i 'd maybe give it a a two .",15,0.5,0.5620999932289124
1,0,"of but i think what is one false , or is t one true ?",15,0.5,0.5541411638259888
1,0,one 's true .,15,0.5,0.5257560610771179
1,0,"i forgot . one 's true , and okay . seven 's fal",15,0.5,0.5272547006607056
0,0,and a four is neutral .,15,0.5,0.45359426736831665
1,0,"four is neutral , okay . so",15,0.5,0.5358706116676331
1,0,so maybe maybe a two .,15,0.5,0.5184155106544495
1,0,"yeah , 'cause we have n't got the double curve , so we ca n't like say it 's completely true .",15,0.5,0.5295347571372986
0,0,go for one . yep .,15,0.5,0.45827898383140564
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.6044912338256836
1,0,but it 's pretty close . we 've got almost everything we can .,15,0.5,0.6004626154899597
0,0,okay . right .,15,0.5,0.4384446144104004
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4706358313560486
1,0,"i gon na put underneath so i 've got some more space . so , false is seven , true is one , and so uh say about a two for fancy ,",15,0.5,0.5774300694465637
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.47475191950798035
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6100537776947021
1,0,you think ?,15,0.5,0.5578723549842834
0,0,"yeah , why not not ,",15,0.5,0.45530492067337036
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5121850371360779
1,0,m m maybe nearer three .,15,0.5,0.6598334908485413
0,0,"okay , well d you do an average at the end , i do n't know . um",15,0.5,0.40376389026641846
1,0,"two three . well , it 's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down , we 've got solar power , we 've got uh various other things you could have , and we 're not going for these options .",15,0.5,0.5967180132865906
0,0,uh-huh . this this is just this is just for like the look . does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . so,15,0.5,0.4973730444908142
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4243333339691162
0,0,"yeah , i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .",15,0.5,0.4230836033821106
1,0,"yeah , so that so sh should we go for a a two on that ?",15,0.5,0.6338220238685608
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6235976815223694
0,0,"'kay . and i mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?",15,0.5,0.2915366291999817
1,0,"um , deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .",15,0.5,0.7854247093200684
0,0,"d yeah . okay . so , what about the pr the prototype as it is ,",15,0.5,0.4485790729522705
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.4219316244125366
1,0,"we 've got we 've got the speech recognition on it , have n't we .",15,0.5,0.6771368980407715
0,0,but not the kinetic .,15,0.5,0.36419346928596497
1,0,but not the kinetic .,15,0.5,0.530358076095581
0,0,like the power .,15,0.5,0.4131339192390442
1,0,no . 'cause you ca n't afford that w we took that out too .,15,0.5,0.5545673966407776
1,0,"no , we c ca yeah , we ca n't afford both .",15,0.5,0.5240640044212341
1,0,"alright , so",15,0.5,0.5255545377731323
1,0,did n't you ? or,15,0.5,0.5931478142738342
1,0,so it does n't it 's pretty the prototype as it is is n't sort of um fulfilling the,15,0.5,0.5198646187782288
1,0,no may is maybe about neutral,15,0.5,0.5768442749977112
1,0,maybe a three .,15,0.5,0.5001135468482971
1,0,"plus it it it 's got something , but it has n't got",15,0.5,0.5017787218093872
1,0,okay . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5617790222167969
1,0,"well , wait a minute . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .",15,0.5,0.5822401642799377
1,0,i would give it more than a four .,15,0.5,0.5276828408241272
0,0,the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .,15,0.5,0.49796661734580994
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5575688481330872
1,0,and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic .,15,0.5,0.5296695828437805
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6082130670547485
1,0,"so , it 's very much dependant on what you do with your options . and if you 're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that",15,0.5,0.526320219039917
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.3806283175945282
1,0,"right , okay .",15,0.5,0.6256421804428101
1,0,"the other functions we 've got in are are more at the the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that 's at the high end 'cause that 's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . now you 're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you 're going for the sample sensors speaker , you 're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else .",15,0.5,0.5213834643363953
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3888947367668152
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5089101195335388
1,0,"and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker ,",15,0.5,0.6714349985122681
0,0,um,15,0.5,0.40795719623565674
1,0,"and then you 're looking to uh take out uh point two ,",15,0.5,0.5885074138641357
1,0,s i 'm just gon na check my email .,15,0.5,0.5859725475311279
0,0,which would be come from the button supplements category .,15,0.5,0.44519269466400146
0,0,i 'm just gon na check exactly what it said in the email for um the product .,15,0.5,0.4892760217189789
1,0,how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we do n't wan na follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .,15,0.5,0.6858958005905151
0,0,"um , interface type um ,",15,0.5,0.3921176791191101
0,0,and then it stand the test of time better .,15,0.5,0.4851718842983246
1,0,well plastic rather than rubber .,15,0.5,0.5322153568267822
1,0,okay . but i,15,0.5,0.5080642700195312
1,0,"that that that would make the significant difference . you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you 'd be looking to take out point two . so you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom .",15,0.5,0.5426364541053772
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5623924732208252
1,0,and that would enable you to to do it .,15,0.5,0.5269597768783569
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.45554688572883606
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5134327411651611
1,0,"so it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so",15,0.5,0.5197291374206543
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5903145670890808
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6403834819793701
1,0,ye,15,0.5,0.6122698783874512
1,0,", i just read the email again and it sort of says it 's evaluate the design sort of as it is , i think , so i think we need to think about finance after we 've sort of evaluated that design . i do n't know whether we 're doing it in the wrong order or something or .",15,0.5,0.592001736164093
1,0,"well , okay , but",15,0.5,0.5669708251953125
1,0,"well , i suppose it 's rubber as it is , is n't it .",15,0.5,0.5273780226707458
1,0,"it 's rubber as it is , yes .",15,0.5,0.5530126690864563
0,0,"so , i mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we 've got both the both the um the speech",15,0.5,0.497736394405365
1,0,we got we 've we 've got thirteen point seven,15,0.5,0.5456051230430603
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6084115505218506
0,0,"and we 've got it in at the moment and if and basically , we 're going to reduce down from that .",15,0.5,0.4272841513156891
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6840585470199585
1,0,"but the current one , you 'd say would be fancy , would be too",15,0.5,0.517888069152832
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5568434000015259
1,0,"yeah . um , for for innovation , so we 've got the speech the speech thing , and",15,0.5,0.6063511967658997
1,0,mm-hmm . i would 've said about a two as well .,15,0.5,0.5072224736213684
1,0,do you reckon a two ?,15,0.5,0.5261176824569702

0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.48425915837287903
0,0,and the next one is i 'll have to get it back up now .,15,0.5,0.4311518669128418

1,0,"it does , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6752013564109802

0,0,yep .,15,0.5,0.42473509907722473
1,0,say about a three maybe ?,15,0.5,0.6922662258148193
0,1,"hi kate . okay , carry on .",15,0.5,0.41506052017211914
1,0,just just carry on .,15,0.5,0.5277579426765442
1,0,"alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . um our agenda should be um that we 're opening the meeting , i have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . um and we should each have a presentation to make . um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it 's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , um which i 'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . okay . um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we 'll come back to them in a minute after i take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . right um as we remember , i opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting 's minutes were reviewed and approved . um sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . and then steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . i think all of us agreed with those things . kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half pence cost . um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . um and the new requirements that it for be for t_v_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . um the corporate image . so we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the t_v_ , but it still should meet those parameters . um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . um at that point we agreed that sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . um and steph was gon na look at ec ergonomics . kate was gon na look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . and i was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?",15,0.5,0.5216063857078552

1,0,is this to the market ?,15,0.5,0.5745424628257751
0,0,"yeah , i mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy ,",15,0.5,0.47421279549598694
0,0,"is spongiest , yeah .",15,0.5,0.47666218876838684
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6085916757583618
1,0,that would add,15,0.5,0.5154572129249573

1,0,are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ?,15,0.5,0.5455306172370911
1,0,well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . so,15,0.5,0.5291275978088379
1,0,perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management,15,0.5,0.6066457629203796
1,0,"yeah , but it 's kind of pointless , is n't it ?",15,0.5,0.5955749750137329

1,0,"you can even have them in different flavours as well . so that if you just wan na sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour ,",15,0.5,0.5013697743415833

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.39247676730155945

0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3772745132446289

1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5064404606819153
1,0,"so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it 's it the technology is there . and we can also incorporate an l_c_d_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we 've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . if we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . all the other fancy interface designs go out the window , i 'm afraid . um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . if you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that 's what you need if you want the l_c_d_ display . and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . now i do n't know what that is , but i think they think it 's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , i have to say , but maybe you think that 's old technology .",15,0.5,0.5916532278060913

1,0,"i think it yeah , you you will do an",15,0.5,0.5246052145957947
1,0,and then you get it with both .,15,0.5,0.52754807472229
0,0,should i do it again ?,15,0.5,0.49943748116493225
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5796363353729248
1,0,maybe .,15,0.5,0.5544600486755371
1,0,this time it should come up both .,15,0.5,0.5062185525894165
1,0,"right then . i do n't actually have a huge amount of different information then what kate says ,",15,0.5,0.511414647102356
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.39242124557495117
1,0,"just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including m_p_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things .",15,0.5,0.6470323801040649

1,0,"uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . uh i 've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel , which well , i could n't find a the picture of the ipod w only linked to a web browser , so i could n't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . it has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse .",15,0.5,0.6206669807434082
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.41299551725387573
1,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.5772523880004883
1,0,"so i was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . like i guess an existing sky or cable one does . like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what 's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it 'll show you what 's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up",15,0.5,0.6312810182571411
1,0,"and you can see what 's on the other channels while you 're watching the same channel on the screen . uh but i 'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote ,",15,0.5,0.6270849704742432
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4436268210411072
1,0,"um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . so",15,0.5,0.5338150262832642
1,0,"what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , i mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , i was thinking , yellow and black , just because that 's the company 's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive .",15,0.5,0.5893521904945374
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4943218529224396
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.41425594687461853
1,0,"and when you 've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it does n't obscure much of the actual picture you 're watching .",15,0.5,0.6745052337646484
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6184847354888916
1,0,"and so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down .",15,0.5,0.5389454364776611
0,0,"yeah , i 'd i 'd certainly support that idea .",15,0.5,0.49194765090942383
1,0,"and uh and i definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . i mean titanium would be great , but i think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . if we 're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then i think titanium 's too futuristic .",15,0.5,0.5424917936325073
0,0,"it 's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we ca n't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .",15,0.5,0.47447338700294495
1,0,yeah . whereas a plastic 's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .,15,0.5,0.6538384556770325
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.35909968614578247
1,1,"right , we 've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . and first off we should state that th the remote control 's for controlling the t_v_ and um how do people use it ? we asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . and we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we 'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control and that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they were n't used very often at all . people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . and young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people were n't quite so keen on speech recognition . there 's a lot more th there 's a lot lot more older people who did n't know whether they wanted it or not as well . um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they could n't find it . and the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . okay , so my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech a design which looks high-tech , basically . um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as louisa said . um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an l_c_d_ menu for other functions on the remote control . that 's worth thinking about . um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gon na buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . that that might be the market that we 're we 're looking for . and we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it 's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . 'cause there 's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .",15,0.5,0.7045239806175232
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3343188464641571
1,0,"okay um , and that 's the end of the slide show . that 's it . cool .",15,0.5,0.6159589290618896
0,0,what was that last wee bit there ?,15,0.5,0.39303696155548096
1,0,do a lot of um,15,0.5,0.5649449229240417
0,0,um about speech recognition ?,15,0.5,0.46148374676704407
0,0,"speech recognition ,",15,0.5,0.46479588747024536
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.29592350125312805
1,0,"but that was only for young people that preferred it , older people did n't .",15,0.5,0.5822705030441284
0,0,"youn young people pref yeah , they s they said that they 'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so .",15,0.5,0.4614142179489136
0,0,no what i maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . um .,15,0.5,0.48745012283325195
0,0,well that 's right .,15,0.5,0.38144949078559875
1,0,yeah . yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.537484347820282
1,0,"and possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have you know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . so you can press a button which is always kept in one place",15,0.5,0.6032290458679199
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.49732089042663574
1,0,"and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .",15,0.5,0.5740299224853516
1,0,"uh-huh . yeah . yeah , we 'd have t that would mean we 'd have to put two products together as well ,",15,0.5,0.5214715003967285
1,0,"that is true , yes .",15,0.5,0.6648951768875122
1,0,"which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but",15,0.5,0.5281165838241577
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4582173526287079
1,0,"there 's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , i ca n't remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that .",15,0.5,0.6781864762306213
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4005366861820221
1,0,sounds reasonable .,15,0.5,0.533905565738678
0,0,"that 'd probably be really simple ,",15,0.5,0.49504542350769043
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5794057250022888
1,0,they 're cheap .,15,0.5,0.5570369362831116
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5258116722106934
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5004839897155762
1,0,yeah . so,15,0.5,0.6024032831192017
1,0,so i guess it 'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote .,15,0.5,0.5664981603622437
0,0,"well if you 're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here i am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . but if you i know . um i was gon na say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . you 'd want to try and av just have the one product that if",15,0.5,0.34596365690231323
1,0,yeah . yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device .,15,0.5,0.6453012824058533
0,0,mm-hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.4826219379901886
1,0,"yeah . um i dunno um talking about vo i mean obviously if you 've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it 'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be .",15,0.5,0.6002820730209351
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.40885043144226074
1,0,but you 've then got the point if if you 're not going with uh voice recognition then,15,0.5,0.6517212986946106
0,0,you could have an option to turn it off . or,15,0.5,0.37620699405670166
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4739479124546051
1,0,"perhaps , um .",15,0.5,0.5003177523612976
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6428956985473633
1,0,so that would solve the problems with the t_v_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .,15,0.5,0.5217604637145996
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5714583992958069
0,0,"so uh any sugges well , any conclusions ?",15,0.5,0.4262322187423706
1,0,um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ?,15,0.5,0.672691822052002
0,0,well if it does then we ca n't .,15,0.5,0.37705910205841064
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4127088785171509
1,0,considering,15,0.5,0.5548661947250366
1,0,"it 's that simple ,",15,0.5,0.5000398755073547
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5338241457939148
1,0,"because we 've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had the design logo was one , which we 've already mentioned . we 've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly .",15,0.5,0.602786123752594
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5207988619804382
1,0,"and the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . so that means that uh",15,0.5,0.5191308856010437
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.46240514516830444
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5652174353599548
1,0,so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project .,15,0.5,0.5288663506507874
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5463805794715881
1,0,so we 're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out .,15,0.5,0.5487576127052307
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5473144054412842
1,0,"so anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick",15,0.5,0.6217851638793945
0,0,has to be simple enough to,15,0.5,0.36734122037887573
1,0,because time to market is is critical . s,15,0.5,0.519699215888977
1,0,i suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . um .,15,0.5,0.5217989087104797
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.44263675808906555
1,0,it would . but probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .,15,0.5,0.5631299018859863
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.4935096502304077
1,0,"added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours .",15,0.5,0.5588497519493103
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5943933725357056
1,0,so and if and we 've got ta get to the end . uh d d i think i think first and foremost we 've got ta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible .,15,0.5,0.529974102973938

1,0,"uh i think i have one in mind , so uh i 'm gon na about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . the spider has a spider lives in a web and uh it has eight legs , and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . unless it 's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . there are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . and uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it 's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else . so i think they did this in uh in charlotte 's web that movie that little uh well it 's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away .",15,0.5,0.5695009231567383

1,0,or maybe yes .,15,0.5,0.5267345309257507
1,0,it would be very funny for us .,15,0.5,0.5668320059776306

1,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.5071290135383606
0,0,okay it 's a friendly panther .,15,0.5,0.3747920095920563

0,0,"now i 've um this is the company 's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and i i i 've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um i would n't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that 's a that 's a standard colour . uh , so we 're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision i 've had to make is that um we 're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and i i um i 'm i 'm i 'm certain that they they are around so , um that i do n't think is a a serious problem . the uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it 's it 's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . um it 's simply made of plastic so th that 's uh that 's no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that 's uh uh there 's some cost there . um and uh we have n't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well i do do n't know that they 're special colour . anyway the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but i thi i think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we 've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers",15,0.5,0.42978689074516296

0,0,mm ?,15,0.5,0.2102365493774414
1,0,of the tested people say that 's it 's quite difficult to to to use the remote control .,15,0.5,0.653618574142456
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3823489248752594
1,0,do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? to to,15,0.5,0.5088559985160828
0,0,oh .,15,0.5,0.4328203499317169
0,0,maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that .,15,0.5,0.43652188777923584
1,0,"would j uh yeah w i i think they they say that it 's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it 's it 's okay .",15,0.5,0.5989248156547546
1,0,mm-hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5146946310997009
1,0,okay . it 's not intuitive first .,15,0.5,0.5369623899459839
1,0,and,15,0.5,0.5059235095977783
0,0,but yeah .,15,0.5,0.4608118236064911
1,0,"but yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? you say that i want , i have six button",15,0.5,0.5622826218605042
0,0,mh-hmm . a a lot of people are uh if you have the l_c_d_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them,15,0.5,0.4215346574783325
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.49847182631492615
1,0,"yeah . but , but also it seems that",15,0.5,0.5836139917373657
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5840966701507568
1,0,but it will be hard to configure i mean imagine i uh,15,0.5,0.582713782787323
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5811598896980286
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.530947208404541
1,0,so it 's really something for the expert user . so,15,0.5,0.5778868198394775
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.3229438066482544
1,0,i mean there are markets and markets . i think the young people are th uh are uh,15,0.5,0.6491827368736267
0,0,christine here said uh you have a,15,0.5,0.36311861872673035
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5650007724761963
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5410754084587097
1,0,"uh it is yeah . so for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . i guess . i do n't know if there is study about that .",15,0.5,0.6615500450134277
0,0,yeah . maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product .,15,0.5,0.35490870475769043
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6394213438034058
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.377176970243454
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6263622045516968
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4221858084201813
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6126994490623474
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.39764413237571716
1,0,and there are another thing is that if we make something that 's simple and easy to use that 's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else .,15,0.5,0.5939026474952698
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5427613258361816
1,0,all right ?,15,0.5,0.5277780890464783
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.4921841323375702
1,0,"otherwise , if it 's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first .",15,0.5,0.6214614510536194
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4088694453239441
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5796388983726501
1,0,but also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons .,15,0.5,0.5525704026222229
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5147470235824585
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3503173887729645
1,0,so we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons,15,0.5,0.5185354948043823
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3755052089691162
1,0,and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . losed lose it etcetera .,15,0.5,0.6921637058258057
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.29338109493255615
1,0,these these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop .,15,0.5,0.5741038918495178
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.35860639810562134
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.44744446873664856
1,0,so but le let us see first the new requirement . so we do n't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we do n't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that,15,0.5,0.5904874801635742
0,0,but teletext is just one button .,15,0.5,0.27840369939804077
1,0,yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff .,15,0.5,0.5014946460723877
1,0,you you just write the write the numbers .,15,0.5,0.5351390242576599
1,0,yeah . so well,15,0.5,0.5736326575279236
0,0,"so will you add with the channel keys , right ?",15,0.5,0.45309871435165405
1,0,"yeah . so anyway we do n't have to include this feature because it 's it 's not used any more by users ,",15,0.5,0.6889076828956604
0,0,so .,15,0.5,0.41379043459892273
1,0,they prefer to s,15,0.5,0.5312023162841797
0,0,i am . i 'm sure that uh it do n't like but uh i do n't see just one button .,15,0.5,0.4331221878528595
1,0,yeah . i dunno .,15,0.5,0.609151303768158
1,0,so .,15,0.5,0.5500953197479248
0,0,if i one button is still one more button . if if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors .,15,0.5,0.40815576910972595
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5374272465705872
0,0,well anyway i have this point . we can discuss . also um so as as i told before uh it would be better if it 's only for the t_v_ um because we want to be quick on on the market . and then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . so this is the the key point .,15,0.5,0.4671539068222046
1,0,so before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .,15,0.5,0.598819375038147
1,0,capital .,15,0.5,0.5056423544883728
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4506518244743347
1,0,"so do you um so so from from the the marketing expert i think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used",15,0.5,0.5284900069236755
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.346479594707489
1,0,"only ten per cent of the button are are used often so i think we have to do something very simple and i think we all agree on that point , no ?",15,0.5,0.5407226085662842
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.3928951025009155
1,0,well if it is going to be just a t_v_ remote control it is going to be very simple .,15,0.5,0.6550412774085999
0,1,"yeah . and uh tool training is one thing that we 're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we 're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , which brings us to our next subject ,",15,0.5,0.38951560854911804

0,0,"as a team we 're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that does n't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . and , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , ca n't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design .",15,0.5,0.40834465622901917

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5867938995361328
1,0,"um , yeah . um , the way that we 're going to go about this is , um , we 'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we 've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . same with conceptual design and detailed design . so , um , making sure that it , it 's usable , that as a , um and that it 's , it 's feasible to create , and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . um , tool training . is , is everyone , um okay .",15,0.5,0.5223606824874878

0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4575573801994324
1,0,"i mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . so i think we can build that in . um yeah well we can skip this part as well , because i thought i read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . um and and also there 's so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . so the physical uh aspect of it . um and i think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control in your room .",15,0.5,0.5707165002822876
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5403291583061218

1,0,do we have uh yeah .,15,0.5,0.6278586983680725
1,0,"yeah so but i i do n't think that 's that 's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it .",15,0.5,0.5098830461502075

1,0,like searching for channels and,15,0.5,0.5444331765174866
0,0,ah look .,15,0.5,0.4805721044540405

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.690159022808075
0,0,"um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . so we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable",15,0.5,0.4413301646709442
0,0,mm-hmm . content and form .,15,0.5,0.35669443011283875
0,0,yeah content and form .,15,0.5,0.46951261162757874

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6553118824958801
0,0,well my presentation is a bit uh sucky .,15,0.5,0.4823325574398041
1,0,well you can improvise right ?,15,0.5,0.701313316822052
1,0,uh which one is it ? technical functions ?,15,0.5,0.5564241409301758
0,0,yeah a little bit .,15,0.5,0.355226069688797
1,0,this one ?,15,0.5,0.6209281086921692
1,0,uh no . no no .,15,0.5,0.5372423529624939
0,0,functional requirements ?,15,0.5,0.4871673285961151
1,0,yeah i think that would be it then .,15,0.5,0.6048216223716736
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.557731568813324
1,0,you did n't put it in ? or,15,0.5,0.5017492771148682
1,0,i have no idea .,15,0.5,0.5612272024154663
0,0,so we we can go for,15,0.5,0.42271921038627625
0,1,okay . yeah . that 's okay . that 's okay .,15,0.5,0.4900526702404022
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5696801543235779
1,0,"am i starting now ? anytime ? oh sorry . 'kay , um . alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and um i hope you had a productive last thirty minutes .",15,0.5,0.6627325415611267
0,0,"um , and um , i 'll be taking minutes on this one , and um being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting is n't very necessary for uh myself , because it 'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . um , so , the first presentation we 'll be looking at is poppy 's presentation . and , um so , sorry ? so , um , take it away poppy .",15,0.5,0.3950445353984833
1,0,"okay . um , do i need to",15,0.5,0.5964444279670715
1,0,"it 's , it 's plugged in . so , um",15,0.5,0.5331450700759888
1,0,plugged in .,15,0.5,0.6610581278800964
1,0,"f_ eight , w . function f_ eight .",15,0.5,0.5952056646347046
0,0,f_ okay . function f_ eight . sorry about this guys .,15,0.5,0.4790949821472168
0,0,no problem .,15,0.5,0.2994101345539093
1,0,'kay . is on . right . okay . i will take this time just to apologise .,15,0.5,0.5804234743118286
1,0,"i , i only , uh , received my emails later on . 'cause i was too busy carried away doing my own thing ,",15,0.5,0.5256408452987671
0,0,which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing .,15,0.5,0.4980548322200775
0,0,but there we go .,15,0.5,0.4143253266811371
1,0,i 'm sure it 's fine .,15,0.5,0.5106164216995239
1,0,"um , so i was looking at how we 're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . and it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . they do n't need to actually manually touch the television set . so , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . um , from uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there 're certain points that will make our product unique . um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um genevieve 's idea . so we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . and we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we 're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . a automatically , um lights up at first touch . or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . um , also we could use um an alarm . so if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . maybe behind a cushion or somewhere .",15,0.5,0.5707008242607117
1,0,"um , so that would work . um , oop . go back there . um , another thing i think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . um , from previous researches i 've carried out on other projects , um we 've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory .",15,0.5,0.5283627510070801
0,0,"so they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . so , for example , a screw that 's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . so um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . so , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and i think that would be very important for products now . especially 'cause there 's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .",15,0.5,0.4868003726005554
1,0,"right , um , one question . this , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ?",15,0.5,0.5414068102836609
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5008659362792969
1,0,"so that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?",15,0.5,0.5899719595909119
0,0,"um and then yeah . yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . and that 's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . i mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it 's the product 's responsibility to get rid of what they 've made . um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components ,",15,0.5,0.4141857624053955
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6151465177536011
0,0,"and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gon na wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . something like the case , if it 's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .",15,0.5,0.4479934871196747
1,0,"mm-hmm . would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? or would we contribute to another group ?",15,0.5,0.5836220383644104
1,0,"you could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . for a certain percentage at least .",15,0.5,0.5049864053726196
0,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.4909341633319855
1,0,"not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce ,",15,0.5,0.5514545440673828
0,0,okay . this sounds like a really great idea .,15,0.5,0.4608879089355469
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.43708980083465576
1,0,one thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .,15,0.5,0.5396333336830139
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.49788475036621094
1,0,"um , so we 'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company ,",15,0.5,0.5710502862930298
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4756496250629425
1,0,"um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . you would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .",15,0.5,0.6153411865234375
0,0,"well i the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they do n't need to be manually de um deconstructed . like , you do n't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . because of this , their properties are smart material .",15,0.5,0.42280110716819763
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.6085410714149475
0,0,"all you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves .",15,0.5,0.49721819162368774
1,0,alright . we 'll still have to investigate the financial implications .,15,0.5,0.5687052607536316
1,0,"so i suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but",15,0.5,0.5552642941474915
0,0,"alright . i like the environmental approach . um , we 'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well .",15,0.5,0.4786514639854431
1,0,yeah . okay . um also there is um components . this 'll be how it uh will actually work . but i have n't put this plan together yet .,15,0.5,0.6008525490760803
1,0,"i 'm sorry , could you",15,0.5,0.5833708643913269
1,0,there we go,15,0.5,0.509670615196228
0,0,those were um,15,0.5,0.4817049205303192
1,0,". sorry , should i go back . this would actually show the circuit diagram . although i have n't come up with the final circuit yet .",15,0.5,0.5229600071907043
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.47536224126815796
1,0,so i just put all those components in .,15,0.5,0.5164735317230225
0,0,"so those are what , um , we 'll c construct the remote . those are all the",15,0.5,0.4539368748664856
1,0,"yeah . i it just shows what sort of energy source . it could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . um , an ' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself .",15,0.5,0.5735664963722229
0,0,alright . great .,15,0.5,0.47268813848495483
1,0,"okay ? so , now is it f_ eight again to escape ? or escape ? there we go . okay .",15,0.5,0.662315845489502
1,0,"alright . thank you very much . and , um , the next presenter will be tara .",15,0.5,0.6336734890937805
0,0,thank you .,15,0.5,0.4508233070373535
1,0,there you go tara .,15,0.5,0.5833171010017395

1,0,"oh ,",15,0.5,0.504574179649353
0,0,"do you think is it uh , function eight yeah ?",15,0.5,0.4590030312538147
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6856325268745422
0,0,function f_ eight .,15,0.5,0.44432419538497925
1,0,function f_ eight .,15,0.5,0.5444508194923401
0,0,function f_ eight . sorry .,15,0.5,0.4719673991203308
0,0,the one at the top .,15,0.5,0.3237916827201843
1,0,oh right . okay .,15,0.5,0.5749014616012573
1,0,that looks right .,15,0.5,0.5072885751724243
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5497182011604309
1,0,"okay . i 'm the user um user interface designer . uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . um , in this case it 's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . by taking inspiration from other similar designs , we 'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . there 're two functional design options . a multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . and a single function remote control , used specifically for the television .",15,0.5,0.6144002676010132
0,0,"i 'm sorry , what was that last one . multifunctional and",15,0.5,0.49800729751586914
1,0,"sorry . um , a single function just for the television itself .",15,0.5,0.5262174010276794
0,0,"ch oh , i see .",15,0.5,0.47215574979782104
1,0,"yeah . um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . a single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .",15,0.5,0.5421760082244873
0,0,'kay .,15,0.5,0.4572351574897766
1,0,"um , i think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it 's easier to use . it 'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . and less functions would have to be included . so it would be cheaper to make . and probably more sellable just because it 's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . does anyone have any questions ?",15,0.5,0.5416479110717773
1,0,"so as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?",15,0.5,0.6170487403869629
0,0,"well , it 's just that , when we 're creating it , we 're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices .",15,0.5,0.4600144922733307
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5902063250541687
1,0,"and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent ,",15,0.5,0.5514005422592163
1,0,d_v_d_s and v_c_r_ ?,15,0.5,0.5631641149520874
1,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.5771418809890747
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.4949601888656616
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5541175603866577
1,0,other entertainment devices .,15,0.5,0.5380489230155945
1,0,"does everyone agree with this ? does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?",15,0.5,0.5816117525100708
1,0,"um , i was just wondering about the , what , what genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . and that would probably , um , i d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . i suppose having that would complicate it a lot more .",15,0.5,0.5033328533172607
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5371674299240112
1,0,and limit the design . do you think ?,15,0.5,0.5756765604019165
1,0,"yeah , i think i agree with the single design thing for now , because we 're trying to do so much , that if we 're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it 's also multi also multifunctional , um , we 're gon na go over budget for one thing .",15,0.5,0.5384523272514343
1,0,yeah . yeah . that 's true . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5768938660621643
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6142553091049194
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5580871105194092
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.558967113494873
1,0,yeah . and with this we 'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design .,15,0.5,0.5264294147491455
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6043326258659363
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4637432098388672
1,0,we 'll have more money to go into the design side of it .,15,0.5,0.6033961176872253
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.42647913098335266
1,0,okay . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5976517796516418

1,0,"alright , well , um ,",15,0.5,0.6162164211273193
1,0,are you ready for your presentation genevieve ?,15,0.5,0.5465654134750366
1,0,yes i am .,15,0.5,0.5552587509155273
1,0,fabulous . except you 're not hooked up to the,15,0.5,0.5600107312202454
1,0,"oh ,",15,0.5,0.5081104636192322

1,0,great .,15,0.5,0.5234346985816956
1,0,okay . okay . oh . i just lost my microphone .,15,0.5,0.5816001296043396
0,0,"no problem ,",15,0.5,0.4796781539916992
1,0,just a moment .,15,0.5,0.6689518690109253
1,1,"uh , making a profit of fifty million euros .",15,0.5,0.606988251209259
0,0,alright so twenty five .,15,0.5,0.45741188526153564
0,0,mm 'kay .,15,0.5,0.3888916075229645
0,0,"so , it 's go gon na have to be be pretty damn trendy .",15,0.5,0.39435747265815735
1,0,"so yeah , i 've the only the only remote controls i 've used usually come with the television , and they 're fairly basic .",15,0.5,0.5796694159507751
0,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.4111361503601074
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5625464916229248
1,0,so uh,15,0.5,0.6068539619445801
0,0,"yeah , i was thinking that as well , i think the the only ones that i 've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they 're ,",15,0.5,0.48427972197532654
1,0,yeah the universal ones . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5311331748962402
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.36955955624580383
1,0,yeah . so presumably that might be an idea to put into .,15,0.5,0.5801348090171814
1,0,but but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . for sure .,15,0.5,0.6250608563423157
0,0,slim .,15,0.5,0.3303702771663666
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5673301219940186
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6771544218063354

1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.534679651260376
1,0,so 'kay .,15,0.5,0.5267070531845093
1,0,okay it should 've gone through to you .,15,0.5,0.5587309002876282
1,0,okay mm yes i have it .,15,0.5,0.5594296455383301
1,0,"mm-hmm . okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we 're gon na use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . um can i just put this on ? so we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wan na buy it . um . this is to do this i will not remove my microphone . we basically used um some focus group surveys which i went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um ,",15,0.5,0.5830978155136108
1,0,"and as part of this the important aspects that came out were things that we 've already discussed really . the most important by far was the look and feel of it . it needs to be something that 's very different from everything else out there . it needs to stand out . it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . people will wan na buy it . um that was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . people have to then think about it and say got something there that i want . that 's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wan na buy it again . third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . this is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel .",15,0.5,0.531717836856842
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3800761103630066
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5604513883590698
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4296278655529022
1,0,"um i had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that 's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . that would make it stand out . um .",15,0.5,0.6451082229614258
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.33524009585380554
1,0,so can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ?,15,0.5,0.69036465883255
0,0,spongy feel ?,15,0.5,0.4028303325176239
1,0,uh about the feeling yeah uh yo,15,0.5,0.65323406457901
1,0,well,15,0.5,0.5960389375686646
1,0,you can,15,0.5,0.5014612674713135
0,0,"ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that 'll be something that sets it apart ,",15,0.5,0.4704611301422119
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.538134753704071
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.418582946062088
1,0,rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment .,15,0.5,0.5030360817909241
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5740839838981628
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5477007031440735
1,0,"so as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . so going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we 've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they 've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . that 's one way of looking at it um . textured feel we just talked about . maybe it 's another way of doing that .",15,0.5,0.5473528504371643
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4733400344848633
0,0,"so if it 's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . so they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever .",15,0.5,0.497091144323349
1,0,"yeah that 's a very good idea , yeah . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5264502167701721
1,0,"um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . they 're big selling items . people put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it 's been lost , uh that 's one thing we could look at . there are other aspects like l_c_d_ screens and speech recognition which were n't i do n't think , in my personal opinion , gon na be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . i think we 're better doing something basic like this",15,0.5,0.6364356279373169
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4148730933666229
1,0,"which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in . and use . i had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves ,",15,0.5,0.6029523611068726
0,0,mm . yes well,15,0.5,0.3645651638507843
1,0,and then,15,0.5,0.5207188129425049
1,0,maybe matthew can can give some more information on the,15,0.5,0.5578693747520447
1,0,yeah,15,0.5,0.5653890371322632
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6433061361312866
0,0,and then th th the finer details of buttons you do n't use as much either hidden away or completely separate .,15,0.5,0.49104946851730347
1,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.5415233969688416
0,0,yep and that 's the presentation .,15,0.5,0.4816169738769531
1,0,voila .,15,0.5,0.618303656578064
1,0,"okay good , that 's very clear .",15,0.5,0.5001131296157837
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.580419659614563
1,0,yeah very clear .,15,0.5,0.554663360118866
0,0,'kay . um . uh,15,0.5,0.48882758617401123
1,0,so does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? i think you,15,0.5,0.6682941913604736
0,0,maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh i 've it was a good idea maybe to to,15,0.5,0.36670181155204773
1,0,"to let the people choose , you mean ?",15,0.5,0.5513747334480286
0,0,"yes the the the there are changeable covers ,",15,0.5,0.4712780714035034
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4147697985172272
1,0,but on the other hand i i do n't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies,15,0.5,0.6036309599876404
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.37252965569496155
1,0,uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational,15,0.5,0.6724299788475037
1,0,"well we 're selling so many units of this . this is gon na be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .",15,0.5,0.5310844779014587
0,0,hmm . mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.46946263313293457
1,0,"yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects .",15,0.5,0.5665367245674133
0,0,mm mm .,15,0.5,0.403266966342926

1,0,sure that fits the,15,0.5,0.5736433863639832
1,0,yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after-sales,15,0.5,0.5774572491645813
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.4011087119579315
1,0,"i mean that would would be very good i mean those covers could go for for three , five euro .",15,0.5,0.5724550485610962

0,0,the,15,0.5,0.4865444302558899
1,0,then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together .,15,0.5,0.5628706812858582
1,0,"together indeed uh ,",15,0.5,0.5065434575080872
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.41450032591819763
0,0,it should be easier with that .,15,0.5,0.48909932374954224
1,0,"because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use ,",15,0.5,0.5264893770217896
1,0,yeah yeah i agree .,15,0.5,0.5420580506324768

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5037515163421631

1,0,yeah so i 'll i 'll go with that actually,15,0.5,0.5554681420326233
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5248765349388123
0,0,"so um okay so m so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . so this this is the general trend to ha the method they do .",15,0.5,0.4758840501308441
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5798952579498291
1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.521284282207489
1,0,"so what i have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the t_v_ , v_c_r_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the v_c_r_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have",15,0.5,0.55145663022995
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3795357048511505
1,0,"and uh there is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like you can basically if you have a multiple functionality , say t_v_ , v_c_r_ or something i say it to the t_v_ and the t_v_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information .",15,0.5,0.5652388334274292
1,0,"mm . mm . i like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like b_b_c_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . that 's a good idea .",15,0.5,0.599088191986084
0,0,"yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly ,",15,0.5,0.4643641412258148

1,0,hmm . mm . yeah i really like that idea .,15,0.5,0.7728001475334167
0,0,so what functionalities do you suggest for that ? for facing this problem ?,15,0.5,0.4919700622558594
0,0,"so it it it 's like it limited one . in the present market i saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word ,",15,0.5,0.4876694083213806
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4816517233848572

0,0,"oh , maybe .",15,0.5,0.43478474020957947
1,0,"okay , so basically i 'm gon na present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control .",15,0.5,0.5478379726409912
0,0,"oh , you can put it here . oh that 's okay , it 's jus",15,0.5,0.3334682583808899
1,0,"um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they 'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they do n't like in remote controls . so basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users do n't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they 'd used in the past were ugly . completely ugly . um they they did n't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they 're watching t_v_ . um , that the layout of the remote controls did n't match they way that they used it . um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . and from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . um and you can see they 're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user 's watching t_v_ .",15,0.5,0.5922569632530212
0,0,"um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . and basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh were n't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well . so we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . and fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there 's many buttons and it 's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . um and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . we also asked some users about some specific features that they 'd like to see in the on the remote control . in particular , do they want an l_c_d_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control .",15,0.5,0.329187273979187
1,0,"um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . they want these features , they want these high technology features .",15,0.5,0.5525243282318115
1,0,"um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . so i guess it depends on where we 're focusing our our market . um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um i think we 're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control .",15,0.5,0.506783664226532

1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5320321917533875
1,0,so i think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .,15,0.5,0.5778186321258545

1,0,"okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . i will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? simply it 's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . and the main idea we do n't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands . and then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . and then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command . okay , uh about what i found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control . they are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves .",15,0.5,0.7244410514831543
0,0,you still want me the presentation .,15,0.5,0.49247846007347107
0,0,"there are two different uh uh solutions i mean . this is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . and uh also as uh i understood , and uh i think it was a part of uh bob , uh uh presentation , people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button . so for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on t_v_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control . and uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you do n't need to tune it any way . and uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as i see . okay . that was my presentation .",15,0.5,0.4791097939014435
1,0,okay . i have a question .,15,0.5,0.5490853786468506
1,0,uh-huh .,15,0.5,0.5831287503242493
1,0,do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ?,15,0.5,0.5886334180831909
1,0,"uh , i do n't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . so they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home .",15,0.5,0.5048065781593323
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6676356196403503
0,0,so can we use any any frequency ?,15,0.5,0.49489086866378784
1,0,"yeah , it should be okay .",15,0.5,0.6384589076042175
1,0,we have the right to use any frequency ?,15,0.5,0.5601509213447571
0,0,"uh no but as i know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . we can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we do n't need to ask any permission .",15,0.5,0.47081416845321655
1,0,"okay . and what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? and so do they have the same frequency , or ?",15,0.5,0.5631917715072632
1,0,"uh for this i 'm not uh i i do n't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your t_v_ can understand it",15,0.5,0.6545475721359253
0,0,"okay . a kind of identification ,",15,0.5,0.4751332104206085
1,0,"yeah , identification code inside the",15,0.5,0.6201207041740417
1,0,"yeah f uh i know about this , since it 's my it 's exactly my field , so .",15,0.5,0.5146917104721069
0,0,okay . so,15,0.5,0.49564218521118164
1,0,"it 's uh kind of handshaking , uh , when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your t_v_ then then it 's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote .",15,0.5,0.5888345837593079
1,0,yeah . so,15,0.5,0.5000013113021851
0,0,"so so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t_v_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay .",15,0.5,0.4582265317440033
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5519115924835205
1,0,the password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . a specific uh remote control has a specific f,15,0.5,0.6313863396644592
1,0,yeah but we we do n't have to think uh about this because i think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . it 's worth to buy .,15,0.5,0.5585964322090149
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4540631175041199

1,0,"uh-huh . okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v",15,0.5,0.5676954388618469
1,0,"yes , i agree . yeah .",15,0.5,0.5518074631690979

1,0,"well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user .",15,0.5,0.5481336712837219
0,0,okay . okay .,15,0.5,0.3309559226036072
1,0,but i do n't know . it 's it 's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use .,15,0.5,0.6422320604324341
0,0,"yeah , well some of these uh , yeah . well , some of that will yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements .",15,0.5,0.4135740399360657

1,0,so,15,0.5,0.6085649728775024
1,0,"uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . i think that 's just basic what we need .",15,0.5,0.5217517018318176

1,0,"and from that on we can user requirements what we need more . uh yeah , i just um um i thought joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and i do n't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it 's com becoming less trendy or something like that .",15,0.5,0.5456057190895081

1,0,sounds interesting .,15,0.5,0.533845067024231
1,0,yeah ?,15,0.5,0.5873939990997314
0,0,"uh , well , that 's all i have to say , i think .",15,0.5,0.48538386821746826

1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.5878975987434387
1,0,"well , then the marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market .",15,0.5,0.593675971031189

0,0,.,15,0.5,0.4840199649333954
1,0,"yeah . it 's alright . um alright , i 've done some research for functional requirements . um yes . the working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . uh , i 've lined them up here . uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . i uh have found some interesting things . we do we do got a market . um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . so if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as i uh quoted here from the uh results . zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . that 's quite a lot . um , relevant options are , of course , power buttons . although , only used once per hour . uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . that does n't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . but it sure um says we should n't make it too uh complicated . fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . and um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . and uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . so , what i was thinking oh , wrong side . we should n't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . group features for a higher usability , uh what i was claiming in the previous meeting . um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there .",15,0.5,0.53976970911026

0,0,"no uh , i agree , i agree .",15,0.5,0.46118852496147156
1,0,"so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and do n't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or",15,0.5,0.5911001563072205
0,0,"not too much , no .",15,0.5,0.4557934105396271
0,0,"you know , it 's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much .",15,0.5,0.45876145362854004
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3686998188495636
1,0,"so we have to think of that . the remote control should only be used for television . otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . so maybe we should leave all d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ related features off completely .",15,0.5,0.645673394203186
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3619455099105835
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5680691599845886
0,0,i do n't know . i think that uh that 's what they 're trying to say .,15,0.5,0.4245665669441223
1,0,"uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . new products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . so you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested .",15,0.5,0.5746555924415588
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.45021530985832214
0,0,"but , well , they 're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger",15,0.5,0.3789272606372833
1,0,"i do n't really agree actually , to be honest . it 's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . it 's only like thirty percent of the total market .",15,0.5,0.6362158060073853
0,0,"yeah , but it is it 's is a dif it 's a fact that the th th that bigger market you 're talking about , we already cover that .",15,0.5,0.35684505105018616
0,0,mayb yeah ?,15,0.5,0.4891763925552368
1,0,"our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . that 's the one we have n't covered yet . so i think that 's what the problem is . we have n't got remote controls for uh",15,0.5,0.5584989786148071
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4390503168106079
1,0,"well i think , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6317375898361206
0,0,maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit .,15,0.5,0.42666035890579224
1,0,"yeah , i think so . maybe if it 's",15,0.5,0.6404543519020081
1,0,"not too much then , bu alright .",15,0.5,0.5102611780166626
1,0,"no no , but i think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . so maybe we can make a remote control that 's primarily interesting for the younger group , but is n't that bad for an older person either .",15,0.5,0.5916654467582703
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5030109882354736
1,0,"uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . our product 's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . okay , something else nice to know .",15,0.5,0.5913444757461548
1,0,but what 's our slogan ?,15,0.5,0.5456550121307373

1,0,"yeah , i 'll have a look .",15,0.5,0.5238026976585388
0,0,i think it 's something about the,15,0.5,0.4954237937927246
1,0,puts fashion in electronics .,15,0.5,0.5190026164054871
0,0,we put the fashion in electronics .,15,0.5,0.4704800248146057

0,0,"okay well , let 's go back to the the agenda . so we 've now had to the three presentations . we know about the new project requirements . that means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . well , if i can uh make a start , i think it 's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it 's gon na be , and i already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . i think we 're we 're looking for some",15,0.5,0.4304458498954773
0,0,"yeah , we we 're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic t_v_ functions . y well , that",15,0.5,0.47520318627357483
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.3948288857936859
1,0,"well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that 's not very uh yeah , we do n't really need to have a simple remote control .",15,0.5,0.5821893811225891
1,0,yeah . yeah .,15,0.5,0.6055870652198792
1,0,"i think we can implement more functions then , because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology",15,0.5,0.535460889339447
0,0,"yeah , but wha",15,0.5,0.41457363963127136
1,0,"yeah , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6272227764129639
1,0,and therefore will be a more,15,0.5,0.5221493244171143
1,0,"m yeah , that 's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , i think they are are c are contradicting each other ,",15,0.5,0.5616574287414551
1,0,but,15,0.5,0.5300146341323853
1,0,"because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just t_v_ , but they s do aim at a younger",15,0.5,0.5276898145675659
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.5495913028717041
1,0,"well , ma",15,0.5,0.5959988832473755
1,0,"yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions are n't used .",15,0.5,0.5725797414779663
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.7164257764816284
1,0,so why should j we put this function in ?,15,0.5,0.5155839920043945
0,0,"well , i think",15,0.5,0.479947566986084
1,0,i think more i think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions .,15,0.5,0.6077104806900024
0,0,"but i think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have y well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t t_v_ and a d_v_d_ player .",15,0.5,0.4028497636318207
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4398965835571289
1,0,"you can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the t_v_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . we do n't want that . i think that was that became clear . we do n't want . but w maybe we should put some func uh , i know that the younger people will most likely have a d_v_d_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh",15,0.5,0.5557961463928223
1,0,"yeah , control .",15,0.5,0.5311011075973511
0,0,"yeah , but uh you said",15,0.5,0.40769392251968384
1,0,"control , remotely .",15,0.5,0.6564680337905884
1,0,"yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we 're making .",15,0.5,0.5109701156616211
0,0,"no , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the the new project requirements told us not to",15,0.5,0.4637672007083893
1,0,it 's n yeah .,15,0.5,0.5758168697357178
1,0,but maybe w yeah . i think we maybe should,15,0.5,0.5823314785957336
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.628793478012085
1,0,"yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . but just the basic functions . maybe like rewind and wind ,",15,0.5,0.5583242774009705
1,0,or n what d what do you guys think ?,15,0.5,0.5987697839736938
0,0,but you can put them under the same button .,15,0.5,0.41274377703666687
1,0,not much more than that .,15,0.5,0.5538198947906494
1,0,"yeah , if as far as possible .",15,0.5,0.5723300576210022
0,0,yep . or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever .,15,0.5,0.4234679937362671
1,0,but what do you think ?,15,0.5,0.6348781585693359
0,0,so t,15,0.5,0.493832528591156
1,0,do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ?,15,0.5,0.5954483151435852
1,0,no .,15,0.5,0.5208795070648193
1,0,"no , you do n't think so ?",15,0.5,0.5884683132171631
1,0,"no , new requirements say no .",15,0.5,0.5752189755439758
1,0,"yeah , the new requirements say so .",15,0.5,0.5383617877960205
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5855329632759094
1,0,but you can put a play and stop and and rewind .,15,0.5,0.5345448851585388
1,0,"well , maybe it 's",15,0.5,0.568282961845398
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5074759721755981
1,0,maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions do n't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control .,15,0.5,0.6250972747802734
0,0,"yeah , but",15,0.5,0.38879743218421936
1,0,"you know , a lot of d_v_d_ players have some tricky settings with",15,0.5,0.6705902814865112
0,0,"yes , but we",15,0.5,0.3457639217376709
1,0,"i i if it 's too simple uh th they wo n't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions .",15,0.5,0.7628463506698608
0,0,y yes .,15,0.5,0.3444083333015442
0,0,"yep , exactly . that 's that 's wha",15,0.5,0.4895986020565033
1,0,"but but for for example , v_c_r_ , that 's better example in this case . i think on a remote control for television you do n't need to be able to programme uh the v_c_r_ to start recording at three p_m_ or whatever ,",15,0.5,0.5369573831558228
0,0,"no no , you do n't no no , you do n't need it . no , no .",15,0.5,0.44708308577537537
0,0,"no , no . exactly .",15,0.5,0.49880802631378174
1,0,huh .,15,0.5,0.5478506088256836
0,0,"just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward .",15,0.5,0.40695080161094666
1,0,"okay , but we have to think uh w we have to think d_v_d_ i th uh , i guess ,",15,0.5,0.5801069140434265
1,0,"yeah , i know , but uh",15,0.5,0.563003659248352
1,0,"so um but uh from my experience it 's kinda a lot of d_v_d_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . it 's c sometimes a bit difficult .",15,0.5,0.5168306231498718
1,0,"mm , yeah .",15,0.5,0.5176181793212891
1,0,"maybe if we just leave the d_v_d_ functional m uh well , i was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , i think we m should focus on the t_v_ then .",15,0.5,0.6061192750930786
0,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.4602489769458771
1,0,"yeah , but just keep it simple and look more at th",15,0.5,0.5791797041893005
1,0,"and uh and it 's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . if you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote .",15,0.5,0.645658552646637
0,0,no . it 's only for television . so,15,0.5,0.45480653643608093
1,0,"okay . it 's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table ,",15,0.5,0.5452417135238647
0,0,"yes , but there are there are",15,0.5,0.49734070897102356
1,0,"and it 's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .",15,0.5,0.5866400599479675
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.42031794786453247
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5860721468925476
1,0,"yeah , nothing more . exactly .",15,0.5,0.5226441025733948
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.4707587957382202
1,0,alright .,15,0.5,0.6552996039390564
0,0,"um , but what televis",15,0.5,0.3486034572124481
1,0,but how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? there are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have,15,0.5,0.6684992909431458
0,0,"yeah , we we 'll make w this one trendy .",15,0.5,0.3289753198623657
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5419994592666626
1,0,and simple .,15,0.5,0.6812454462051392
1,0,the user interface is easy .,15,0.5,0.5979010462760925
1,0,"well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . so we should put uh zap buttons on it . um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels .",15,0.5,0.6018087267875671
1,0,"and the basic yeah , basic functions , yeah .",15,0.5,0.6086745858192444

1,0,"uh ,",15,0.5,0.5373048186302185
1,0,it 's too much integrated in the other .,15,0.5,0.5350548028945923
0,0,"okay , a t a teletext button should be there . but just one big teletext button , on and off .",15,0.5,0.3768211901187897
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5795383453369141
1,0,probably .,15,0.5,0.5701608061790466
0,0,"yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . i think stop function is very useful . if you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader ,",15,0.5,0.47623181343078613
1,0,"oh , okay .",15,0.5,0.6198865175247192
0,0,"then i think it 's very irritating if the next page shows up , but",15,0.5,0.49980637431144714
1,0,"yeah , but uh i think that becomes too difficult , it 's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then .",15,0.5,0.662941575050354
0,0,"well , i use it very regularly , the action . i re i use it quite often .",15,0.5,0.44064590334892273

1,0,will you look,15,0.5,0.533057689666748
1,0,"we have to well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated .",15,0.5,0.6231831908226013
0,0,look at the market .,15,0.5,0.4132368862628937
1,0,we just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . yeah . i do n't know . i think that that 's kin getting too complex for our remote .,15,0.5,0.5018543601036072

0,0,"yeah , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ? or do you think it uh i think it 's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function .",15,0.5,0.49703267216682434
0,0,"well , uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um , a couple of weeks ago i looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th",15,0.5,0.4764028489589691
1,0,"yeah . okay , it goes yeah , but that 's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . that 's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements .",15,0.5,0.6272304058074951
0,0,"yes , but you could put",15,0.5,0.4406396746635437
1,0,"yeah , but",15,0.5,0.6652093529701233
1,0,on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages .,15,0.5,0.5179812908172607

0,0,"if you have seven pages , you can go up and down .",15,0.5,0.4989168345928192
1,0,"lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using",15,0.5,0.6702286601066589
1,0,yes .,15,0.5,0.501903235912323

1,0,true .,15,0.5,0.5356420874595642

1,0,a simple yeah .,15,0.5,0.6307775974273682
1,0,"okay . um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ? or do we uh i dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . we have the zap and uh the volume . should we do m make them very big ? the the the zap button . d d",15,0.5,0.5776292681694031

0,0,"you do n't really have to , i mean , if you like 'em",15,0.5,0.38279229402542114

1,0,"um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five euro , and our profit aim is fifty million euro . we 're going to make this an international product marketed in the states , in europe , in asia . and um our production cost to make that profit is gon na be a max of twelve fifty euro per remote . okay . so we 're gon na talk for a little while . um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . so .",15,0.5,0.5598467588424683
0,0,now ?,15,0.5,0.38234078884124756
0,0,yeah . you wan na start us off ? anybody have anything to offer ?,15,0.5,0.4965103566646576
1,0,"well , we wan na make a multifunctional remote , right ?",15,0.5,0.5772510170936584
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.3665921688079834
1,0,one remote for everything .,15,0.5,0.5327414274215698
1,0,"and everything being wait , we have what , sound system , t_v_ , d_v_d_ , v_h_s_ , uh tivo ?",15,0.5,0.5029512047767639
0,0,right .,15,0.5,0.491854727268219

1,0,"yeah , tivo .",15,0.5,0.5792510509490967
1,0,tivo .,15,0.5,0.5565653443336487

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5371990203857422
0,0,if po if we 're gon na do it,15,0.5,0.4041161835193634
1,0,it needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal .,15,0.5,0.6162968277931213
0,0,"they 're never universal . that 's right . esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , d_v_d_ player , say , usually it does n't work if it 's not one of the",15,0.5,0.3612346649169922
0,0,"or if it 's not like a sony , if it 's like a i do n't know .",15,0.5,0.4900928735733032
1,0,yeah . yeah . something from sam 's club .,15,0.5,0.5934736728668213
0,0,so we 'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals .,15,0.5,0.47672349214553833
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6294483542442322
1,0,"and what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways .",15,0.5,0.6370058655738831
1,0,"yeah . 'kay , and um another thing that i think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . if it 's just flat and kind of boring th those do n't nobody wants to buy those any more . they want the ergonomic ones .",15,0.5,0.5577847361564636
1,0,they want like the flashy lights .,15,0.5,0.5357235074043274
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6354369521141052
1,0,oh like this came from las vegas .,15,0.5,0.5316441059112549
1,0,"ones that ones that look high-tech , too .",15,0.5,0.5057203769683838
0,0,but at the same time are simple .,15,0.5,0.4805172085762024
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5324398875236511
0,0,mm yeah .,15,0.5,0.3961604833602905
1,0,so that people like my mother can use it .,15,0.5,0.655271589756012
0,0,what about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ?,15,0.5,0.26917991042137146
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.48450303077697754
1,0,'kay . anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that,15,0.5,0.658119261264801
0,0,just bad ones .,15,0.5,0.32665741443634033
1,0,yeah . that 's true .,15,0.5,0.5888340473175049
1,0,um .,15,0.5,0.5135239958763123
1,0,what kinda battery would we want to use ? because battery changing is usually,15,0.5,0.6352922320365906
0,0,d double a_ .,15,0.5,0.3119872212409973
0,0,double a_ .,15,0.5,0.4557104706764221
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5375203490257263
1,0,do some of them use triple a_s though ?,15,0.5,0.670831561088562
0,0,yeah some use triple a_s .,15,0.5,0.41087499260902405
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.45310017466545105
1,0,some but,15,0.5,0.5345573425292969
0,0,so double or triple ?,15,0.5,0.43166154623031616
1,0,"yeah , i guess then it 's if we need to do triple a_ we can , but most people usually have double a_s around .",15,0.5,0.5989030003547668
1,0,"okay . yeah . but that has to do with the size of it too . well , w as long as we know that issue is",15,0.5,0.5060116052627563
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6176520586013794
1,0,right .,15,0.5,0.5663111209869385
1,0,here we can,15,0.5,0.5372002124786377
1,0,"yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we 'd probably wan na go with a triple a_ .",15,0.5,0.5357030630111694
1,0,triple a . but,15,0.5,0.5058979392051697
1,0,can you with a small lithium battery ?,15,0.5,0.690008282661438
0,0,"it 's okay , we do n't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important .",15,0.5,0.43103015422821045
0,1,uh i do n't mind .,15,0.5,0.48429074883461
1,0,p fine .,15,0.5,0.6912208199501038
1,0,uh can i steal the cable ?,15,0.5,0.5020189881324768
1,0,"oh sorry , you can indeed .",15,0.5,0.5412487387657166
1,0,cheers .,15,0.5,0.5109683275222778
1,0,i got a how do i start there ?,15,0.5,0.517966091632843

1,0,"that one . cool . well these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab . took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they 're used and how much their necessary and stuff . and general opinions about current current remotes . see that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . so some kind of a new style should be incorporated that 's less ugly . uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they 'd spend more money on it . which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it 'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . i can empl i kinda take that to mean as um they they do n't uh they , yeah , they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat i 've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a d_v_d_ player , a video player and t_v_ . if it was uh i mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes are n't really matched well to my behaviour . uh again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . i took to mean that they just they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume . and uh yeah , uh i think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we 'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we 're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings are n't h hardly ever used and used very are n't considered relevant by the user . so i think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , i dunno . uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control .",15,0.5,0.6067218780517578

0,0,"alright . thank you very much . um . one of the the biggest issues i found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and i think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . so um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . and if we devote some energy into this , i think the um recent productions of real reaction , the i go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , i think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . and um in fact i think the high definition d_v_d_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool . so again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . um fifty percent i think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . and eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , d_v_d_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .",15,0.5,0.40696853399276733

1,0,well .,15,0.5,0.6043370366096497
1,0,so these are important numbers that matthew and i need to take into account for our functional um,15,0.5,0.5044283270835876
0,0,oh yeah .,15,0.5,0.4876631498336792
1,0,oh i need to muck around with this . it 's probably easier if you put it on yours and then i 'll just email it to you . it 's just a web link .,15,0.5,0.6447936296463013
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3242042660713196
1,0,yeah,15,0.5,0.6205401420593262
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.6340157985687256
1,0,yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design .,15,0.5,0.5443891882896423
1,0,hmm . yeah .,15,0.5,0.5515432953834534
1,0,"one thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute .",15,0.5,0.6631089448928833
1,0,because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important .,15,0.5,0.5985551476478577
0,0,mm-hmm . yep .,15,0.5,0.4166090488433838
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4892203211784363
1,0,"um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control .",15,0.5,0.5486930012702942
0,0,speech recognition in,15,0.5,0.36406829953193665
0,0,and who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .,15,0.5,0.4432578980922699
0,0,d do you have numbers o o on that ?,15,0.5,0.39316070079803467
0,0,ah okay .,15,0.5,0.4538819491863251
0,0,"yes , i 'll just get this up .",15,0.5,0.4489856958389282
1,0,so that we do n't do we not need any button on the remote control,15,0.5,0.6249377727508545
0,0,"well potentially yeah , um",15,0.5,0.3043515682220459
1,0,it would be all based on speech .,15,0.5,0.6260591745376587
0,0,i think even for interesti,15,0.5,0.3383236229419708
1,0,okay . interesting idea .,15,0.5,0.5299316048622131
0,0,yeah i think that would not work so well . you wan na have both options .,15,0.5,0.4696061313152313
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.42395031452178955
1,0,"well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost ,",15,0.5,0.6493874788284302
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.37371617555618286
1,0,"i mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it does n't matter where it is , my well it 's we should be in range ,",15,0.5,0.5259969830513
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5958055853843689
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.33714619278907776
1,0,"or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . but the these are all quite fancy features",15,0.5,0.5999351739883423
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5548704266548157
0,0,i 'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve euro fi and fifty cents .,15,0.5,0.4702773690223694
1,0,well it would be f,15,0.5,0.517551600933075

1,0,no you ca n't .,15,0.5,0.519780158996582
1,0,"and we do n't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ?",15,0.5,0.5996329188346863
1,0,"oh . well , it depends you know like there is uh it 's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three ,",15,0.5,0.5117323398590088
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3332454264163971

1,0,it 's not going to be s so easy but u usually it 's going to be more of an isolated case,15,0.5,0.5110527276992798
1,0,do you have some more important facts,15,0.5,0.5070939064025879
1,0,but it 's but i do n't know with twenty fi,15,0.5,0.5167842507362366

0,0,you had to to to summarise maybe the,15,0.5,0.4589230418205261
1,0,"this is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um . ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five .",15,0.5,0.6362308263778687

1,0,okay perfect . .. .,15,0.5,0.6257679462432861

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5623200535774231
1,0,another thing it 's talking about there is the l_c_d_ screen but there 's no figures apparently on that .,15,0.5,0.5633445978164673
1,0,mm . okay . um,15,0.5,0.5657037496566772
1,1,"okay , you can you open the conceptual design presentation ?",15,0.5,0.6080693006515503
1,0,"conceptual design , yes .",15,0.5,0.614213228225708
1,0,see what was on the agenda .,15,0.5,0.5679581761360168
1,0,lazy .,15,0.5,0.6130924820899963
1,0,the agenda .,15,0.5,0.5357798933982849
1,0,"this is his own remote . because um , maybe we can start with the technical uh functions ,",15,0.5,0.5665795803070068
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.46761858463287354
0,0,"but i do n't think it 's there uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an l_c_d_ display , for example ?",15,0.5,0.43248629570007324
1,0,"well , it 's nice , of course . but i do n't i do n't know what to display on it .",15,0.5,0.6636631488800049
0,0,only if we,15,0.5,0.39894795417785645
1,0,me neither .,15,0.5,0.5611459612846375
0,0,"maybe maybe we can make a t_v_ guide on it , for the channel you 're on .",15,0.5,0.4542349874973297
1,0,i mean,15,0.5,0.5571415424346924

1,0,i do n't think we should do it .,15,0.5,0.6307274699211121
0,0,you can uh zap through them with the page up page down button .,15,0.5,0.4815175533294678
0,0,"yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large l_c_d_ screen , because",15,0.5,0.4998873770236969
1,0,"yes , it can on your no , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . so why not on your remote ?",15,0.5,0.5902209281921387
0,0,"yeah , but no . i do i think it 's a bit redundant , actually .",15,0.5,0.40274104475975037
1,0,"yeah , i do n't know .",15,0.5,0.6432303786277771

0,0,well well what would you display on it then ?,15,0.5,0.4952004849910736
1,0,it 's,15,0.5,0.5055573582649231
0,0,"uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide",15,0.5,0.4572513997554779
0,0,programme information .,15,0.5,0.4070337116718292
1,0,"but is it is n't that a already on t_v_ , a lot of new t_v_s ?",15,0.5,0.6305201649665833
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.4439612627029419
0,0,"on t on teletext , yes . also on the internet .",15,0.5,0.3789224624633789
1,0,well a lot a lot of t_v_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a,15,0.5,0.7213299870491028
0,0,but,15,0.5,0.28280511498451233
1,0,"but you 're already watching the t_v_ , you 're not gon na watch your remote control .",15,0.5,0.6284265518188477
0,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.4446162283420563
1,0,"yes , but you also want to know what 's next .",15,0.5,0.5844001173973083
1,0,"but then we also uh w need to bring out a line of t_v_s which we were planning to ,",15,0.5,0.5641323328018188
1,0,"yeah ,",15,0.5,0.6322221159934998
1,0,and we also have to yeah .,15,0.5,0.5331824421882629
1,0,"but whatever . because the t_v_ has to send information back to the r_c_ , and i do n't know if that 's possible .",15,0.5,0.5937090516090393
0,0,"yes , that 's uh really possible .",15,0.5,0.4542829990386963
1,0,"yes , yes , o of course it 's possible ,",15,0.5,0.6353141665458679
1,0,"but you got ta uh implement it in the t_v_s , and i do n't think everyone 's gon na buy a real reaction t_v_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control .",15,0.5,0.583824098110199
0,0,"i really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an l_c_d_ in it ,",15,0.5,0.31484100222587585
1,0,and i also,15,0.5,0.643541693687439
0,0,"but i i really do n't think it 's a good n goo because it also does n't stroke with we wanted uh c when we talk about the materials , uh it 's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . it was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it .",15,0.5,0.4975317418575287
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.5091956853866577
1,0,"but i do n't think a l_c_d_ display fits in that image . you know , it 's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know .",15,0.5,0.5482613444328308
1,0,"that 's true , that 's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it 's not very solid , it 's uh frag fragile .",15,0.5,0.6027165651321411
1,0,"yeah , yeah . you could make it , but it 's just it it does n't i do n't think it it 's coherent with the design we 're after .",15,0.5,0.5848003625869751
1,0,no . no . i do n't think so ei either .,15,0.5,0.6569592952728271
1,0,"but that 's my opinion . well , you you y okay , we can vote for it . you want the l_c_d_ display . i do n't want to and he does n't , so it 's up to him .",15,0.5,0.508833646774292
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.47876328229904175
0,0,if we wan na,15,0.5,0.4997296631336212
1,0,"yeah , i dunno .",15,0.5,0.5843254923820496
0,0,. ah .,15,0.5,0.4668629467487335

1,0,". oh , okay .",15,0.5,0.5551454424858093
1,0,bastard .,15,0.5,0.5340421199798584

1,0,m but what what i so what i but do you think we should,15,0.5,0.5524938702583313
1,0,"yeah , i do n't know . uh , uh i i if it 's it 's a simple p",15,0.5,0.5463854670524597
1,0,we 're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . so,15,0.5,0.5953548550605774
1,0,"no , that that 's right ,",15,0.5,0.5399228930473328
1,0,no uh um,15,0.5,0.559455156326294
1,0,"and uh i also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . kind of l_c_d_ or something or",15,0.5,0.5564444661140442
0,0,"y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions .",15,0.5,0.409267783164978
1,0,"yeah , i guess .",15,0.5,0.5109614729881287
1,0,"but how does it display then ? w when i go to the second channel , what what does it show me ?",15,0.5,0.5428063273429871
1,0,"uh , then you push a button . the title and the information about the programme .",15,0.5,0.5174472332000732
0,0,about that programme ?,15,0.5,0.44489023089408875

1,0,"nah , that 's not gon na work .",15,0.5,0.5600659251213074
1,0,"but maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first",15,0.5,0.5075244903564453
0,0,no .,15,0.5,0.44711801409721375

1,0,you have the biggest uh,15,0.5,0.5461537837982178
1,0,"do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d l_c_d_ displays ,",15,0.5,0.5424361824989319
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6135817766189575

1,0,uh uh i really do n't feel the whole idea of an l_c_d_ display .,15,0.5,0.5626792311668396

1,0,it 's overdone .,15,0.5,0.5540832281112671

1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5494970083236694
1,0,"i 'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something .",15,0.5,0.5619691610336304

1,0,i will rule the world with it .,15,0.5,0.5146598815917969
1,0,probably so .,15,0.5,0.504966676235199
1,1,"and also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some kind of indicator ,",15,0.5,0.6127260327339172
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.36582353711128235
1,0,so it could be a blinking option of l_e_d_,15,0.5,0.6623602509498596
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.3736659586429596
1,0,it could actually be used to detect also .,15,0.5,0.6108812093734741
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6390553116798401
1,0,if it 's in a dark room you can basically detect it also .,15,0.5,0.5757108926773071
0,0,mm . hmm .,15,0.5,0.4514833688735962
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.4878998398780823
1,0,yeah .,15,0.5,0.6426618099212646
1,0,"i like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark ,",15,0.5,0.58210688829422
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.38863858580589294
1,0,so,15,0.5,0.5322494506835938
0,0,so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something .,15,0.5,0.3792969882488251
1,0,"no actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um , it can be for two purposes ,",15,0.5,0.6077095866203308
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.21934792399406433
1,0,"like if you have an l_c_d_ display and all those things it 's not going to be the standard remote ,",15,0.5,0.6815211176872253
0,0,mm . hmm .,15,0.5,0.25147494673728943
1,0,which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of d_c_ .,15,0.5,0.6703206300735474
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.3761495351791382
1,0,"it may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit .",15,0.5,0.6567344069480896
0,0,mm .,15,0.5,0.30778512358665466
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.39951810240745544
1,0,"and then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something",15,0.5,0.7029954791069031
0,0,it 's true .,15,0.5,0.4666723906993866

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5378034710884094

1,0,.,15,0.5,0.5008505582809448
1,0,yeah so,15,0.5,0.5795606374740601
1,0,i do n't know how if if i have time to talk about the,15,0.5,0.5657315850257874
1,0,mm yes um i would,15,0.5,0.5669139623641968
0,0,you you have time some more ? yep .,15,0.5,0.4638850688934326
1,0,yes yes you can you can still . we have time .,15,0.5,0.6163871884346008
1,0,sure you can you know .,15,0.5,0.5344004034996033
1,0,"okay . so what i 'm gon na present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a r_c_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you .",15,0.5,0.5794327855110168
0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.482918381690979
1,0,"so the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like , and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and i will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . so there are two uh different types of uh um two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control .",15,0.5,0.5826926231384277
0,0,nice .,15,0.5,0.4447295665740967
0,0,hmm .,15,0.5,0.47634029388427734
1,0,"uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . and uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components um . so you finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key ,",15,0.5,0.6350430250167847

1,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.5804420113563538
1,0,"and uh uh that 's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um . so electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it 's easier to mass produce and assemble . and uh so i think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know v_ v_l_s_i_ or f_p_g_a_ uh high technology ,",15,0.5,0.5011801719665527
1,0,yeah mm mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.561705470085144

0,0,mm-hmm .,15,0.5,0.4817762076854706
1,0,so my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . if it 's plastic,15,0.5,0.6029136776924133

1,0,well well,15,0.5,0.5952281951904297
1,0,i dunno .,15,0.5,0.5088687539100647
