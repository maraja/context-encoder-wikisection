1,1,"okay . good morning , everyone . welcome to the children , young people and education committee . we 've received apologies for absence from janet finch-saunders , and also from dawn bowden , and i 'd like to welcome huw irranca-davies , who is substituting for dawn bowden . can i ask members if there are any declarations of interest , please ? no . okay . we 'll move on , then , to our evidence session for our inquiry on school improvement and raising standards . i 'd like to welcome kirsty williams am , minister for education , and steve davies , director of education . thank you both for attending and for your detailed paper in advance of the meeting . we 've got a lot of ground to cover , so we 'll go straight into questions , if that 's okay . if i can just start by asking you : to what extent is the organisation for economic co-operation and development still involved in the welsh government 's school improvement journey ?",15,0.5,0.536841869354248
0,0,"first of all , can i thank the committee for their invitation this morning , and their interest in this particular area ? as you will be aware , on coming into office , the director and i agreed to ask the oecd to do a rapid review of the state of welsh education at the beginning of this assembly term . they did that , and the feedback from that work informed the publication and content of the national mission . i was very clear in the national mission that i would invite the oecd back to review our progress against that mission , and that has happened in the tail end of last year , and the oecd will publish their latest report on welsh education next month now , in march . so , the expectation is that the report will be published on 23 march , and my intention is to make a statement to the chamber on 24 march . the nature of that review is part of our ongoing development of self-evaluation . so , we talk a lot about self-evaluation in the school system . actually , the continuing relationship with oecd is about self-evaluation of the entirety of the system and welsh government . we do n't want to accept our own orthodoxy and just be in a bubble where we are constantly listening to ourselves and those people who might want to agree with us or tell us what we want to hear . so , the oecd is our best attempt of having some external verification of where we are . that 's a risk for ministers and for government , because we want them to give an honest evaluation of where we are , but that 's a really important tool for me , to ensure that we 're constantly testing ourselves . the nature of that review is that the oecd were able to talk to whoever they felt it was important to talk to , so that included practitioners on the ground , elements of the middle tier , as well as welsh government . and i know , chair—i hope you 'll be pleased to hear this—that the reports of this committee have formed parts of their review , looking at how the senedd itself has contributed to and has held the government to account . so , as i said , we expect our report to be published towards the end of march .",15,0.5,0.4085005521774292
1,0,"okay , thank you , minister . can i ask about the powers under the school standards and organisation ( wales ) act 2013 , to ask you to tell us about the use of those powers either by welsh government or by local authorities , and how effective you feel that legislation has been ?",15,0.5,0.5004624128341675
0,0,"okay . well , as you 'll be aware , local authorities have quite extensive powers of intervention in schools if they feel that is necessary . if i 'm honest , i think there 's a mixed picture , with some local authorities using those powers not on a regular basis , but obviously demonstrating a willingness to use those powers . there are other local authorities who do n't seem to have used them . since that legislation came into being , there have been a number of reasons , because of course a local authority has to give a reason for using those powers of intervention . they usually focus on standards , but sometimes they focus on a breakdown in governance arrangements , perhaps , or a failure or a breakdown in financial management . so , sometimes the budgetary issues trigger an intervention power . and the types of interventions that have been used have included , in some cases , appointing additional governors to governing bodies , or suspending a school 's delegated budget so the local authority takes on , then , financial control of that particular school , or sometimes applying to the welsh government to entirely replace a governing body and establish an intervention board . so , if i can give you an example of where that 's been used and has been successful , in flintshire . they applied to welsh government for two interim executive boards , in sir richard gwyn catholic high school and in ysgol trefonnen . they applied to us . those governing bodies were dissolved . the iebs were put in place and both of those schools , which had been in special measures , moved quite rapidly , actually , out of special measures . perhaps the most recent example of this is one that the chair will know very well in her own constituency of torfaen , in cwmbran high school , where torfaen has intervened in that case . the welsh government has not used those powers to date . my expectation always is that local authorities should be the first port of call , and i would encourage—and we always encourage—local authorities to take a proactive approach to intervention and to use those powers . but it 's my belief that it is they who are best placed initially to do that .",15,0.5,0.3659577965736389
0,0,"thank you , minister . can i ask , then , about the national evaluation and improvement resource and how significant a role that will play in the raising of school standards , and how you feel it 's evolved since it was first conceived ?",15,0.5,0.3376995027065277
0,0,"so , this brings us back to the principle of self-evaluation and something , if we 're honest , we 've not been very good at . if you look at a number of chief inspectors ' reports into the welsh education system , self-evaluation has always been identified as something that is missing or underdeveloped in our system to date , hence , then , the work to establish not a new approach , but a more robust approach to self-evaluation . we 've done that in conjunction , again , with the oecd , middle tier and practitioners . it 's really important , throughout the entirety of our reform journey that that 's done in co-construction , because we want this resource to be usable in schools . so , it 's all very well having a conceptual idea and people outside the classroom working on it , but if it 's of no practical use to a school leadership team , then we wo n't see the impact . so , it's— . we 're in phase 2 at the moment , where we 're doing— . so , the initial resource has been developed by the oecd , middle tier and practitioners . we 're in the testing phase at the moment and having it evaluated itself , with a view to introducing that resource across the system at the start of the new academic year , in september 2020. i truly believe that , if we 're to make progress in welsh education , we have to develop the skills within our system to have robust self-evaluation . this resource gives us continuity of approach right the way across wales . so , it 's not left to an individual school to come up with a system ; it 's right the way across the system . my hope would be that those principles could then be applied to local education authorities , to regional school improvement services and welsh government as part of a whole-system approach to self-evaluation . i do n't know if there 's anything more you want to add , steve .",15,0.5,0.3524077832698822

0,0,"oh , yes , sorry .",15,0.5,0.3812534809112549
0,0,"so , they have played a critical role and , as we know , as the minister has said in the past , she may introduce policy and practice , but if estyn are part of it then schools , usually , because they recognise that it will be part of the inspection process—it gives it greater push and support around it . so , they 've been key players within it .",15,0.5,0.33705419301986694
0,0,"and i think , if i just say as well , that the external perception of what that 's about is really important . it 's not a test of school readiness for reform , it is a genuine attempt for a school to evaluate their strengths , their weaknesses and where they need to go next . it 's not an estyn checklist . and because of the word 'toolkit'—the feedback was that it gave the impression of a checklist , 'just do this and check list ' . so , we 're actually going to change the name of that resource . so , it 'll be called the national evaluation and improvement resource , rather than the toolkit , because , as i said , the feedback was that 'toolkit ' gave the impression of a checklist exercise , and it 's got to be about more than that if it 's going to be meaningful . so , it 'll be changed to an 'improvement resource ' .",15,0.5,0.4716142416000366
0,0,"okay . before i bring suzy in , can i just welcome siân gwenllian , who is joining us via video-conference in north wales ? morning , siân .",15,0.5,0.3313256800174713

0,0,the resource .,15,0.5,0.3540404140949249
1,0,"yes , the resource , thank you—about whether there were any conflicting ideas in the process of development that made it quite difficult to zone in on something that school leadership teams , in particular , could rely on . were there differences of opinion on what this should look like ?",15,0.5,0.5253428220748901
0,0,"not that i 'm aware of from the practitioners that i 've spoken to who have been part of that . so , for instance , suzy , you will know the very small school of gladestry . the head of gladestry has been involved in this process , and she said that she 'd really enjoyed the process of working alongside estyn and the oecd as a school leader to be able to shape it . but i 'm not aware that there 's been conflict in that process .",15,0.5,0.4128829836845398
0,0,"i 'm not suggesting that there has been ; i 'm just interested as to how it had worked , that 's all .",15,0.5,0.2982339560985565
0,0,"chair , i think , inevitably , when you bring stakeholders together , they 're not going to be in total agreement as to how it 's going to work , and i think initially one of the challenges was having estyn there as part of the facilitation group . there are always some concerns that , actually , it 's coming from a to inspect , oral , judgmental tick box . so , we had some early day challenges where we had to convince—and , ultimately , estyn convinced them—that they were there to help and support as opposed to to inspect , and that the model that was developed , as the minister said , was not going to be a tick box , 'you are good at this part of self-evaluation ' , it was to build the skillsets up .",15,0.5,0.2676007151603699
0,0,"okay . so , it 's got their full confidence .",15,0.5,0.4544178545475006
0,0,"yes , and i think again , also , what— . you know , four years into the job , what i 've reflected on as well is there is this sometimes a feeling out there that the minister says all the right stuff , but you 're not actually going to do it , so , when you talk about a new approach to doing things , you 're not actually serious about it . so , trying to build that confidence that we are serious about developing a new system around self-improvement , which is different from accountability—sometimes , the practitioners are like , 'oh , yes , we 've heard it all before but it never actually happens . ' and i think that 's been a part of the constant—not pressure , but the responsibility on welsh government is in following through . so , we said that we were going to do this in the national mission , and we are going to do it . i 'm really proud that there or thereabouts , a few months either way , we 've actually kept to the timetable as outlined in the national mission , and that helps build confidence within the sector that we are committed to that programme and we 're going to do what we say we 're going to do .",15,0.5,0.2946562170982361
0,0,okay . thank you .,15,0.5,0.4346969723701477
0,0,"and a final question from me : how effective do you think the investment in school standards has been in this assembly term , as opposed to the approach taken in the last assembly term , where there was the protection put in place for core school budgets ?",15,0.5,0.35143667459487915
0,0,"well , i think , first of all , it 's important that , whilst this additional resource is specifically targeted at school standards , that is only a part of a much wider education budget , a budget that—you know—is incredibly complex . and so it is really challenging to be able to draw straight lines—you know , 'we did this and it 's resulted in that'—given that we 're looking at the entirety of school funding here . what 's been really important is that , if you drill down into what that money has been spent on , 50 per cent of it has been directed towards professional learning in one form or another to support our teaching professionals . and that 's been really important to me . i 've said it time and time again : an education system can not exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in , day out to work with them and teach them . therefore , that investment in staff and investment in the professional learning of our staff and support for them i think is making a difference already but , importantly , will continue to make a difference . but i think it is really challenging to be able to say , 'well , we spent this bit of money and it definitely led to that ' , because it 's such a complex picture . but that money , the way it 's been spent , has been driven by evidence . and , again , what we do know from international best practice , what do we know that works in driving up standards , and then how can we align the money that we 've got to supporting that ? and , as i said , 50 per cent of that money has gone directly to simply supporting the professional learning of those who work with our children .",15,0.5,0.3519527018070221
0,0,thank you very much . we 're going to talk now a bit about schools causing concern with questions from huw irranca-davies .,15,0.5,0.3631287217140198
0,0,"thank you , chair . if i can , just first of all , zoom in on the way in which we actually decide which schools need what support . so , one of the interesting questions for us is how do we use the different systems out there . so , we 've got the school categorisation system , which we 're familiar with . we 've also got estyn inspection reports , then we 've got other intelligence , including local intelligence on the ground . how do you decide from that ? how is it decided what schools need support , need challenge ? how do we do that ?",15,0.5,0.2852032780647278
0,0,"well , you 're right : what we have is a variety of ways in which we can identify schools that need support , or need to be challenged on their practice . but it 's important not to confuse them either . so , our primary route to doing this is our school categorisation system . sometimes , and perhaps this is inevitable— . that system is primarily there as a triage system around identifying where our resource should be spent . so , our school improvement service—it 's a risk-based approach , so they can evaluate where they need to put their time , effort and resource . sometimes , it 's used by other people for other things , but that is not its primary purpose ; its primary purpose there is not one of accountability , it is one of identifying risk and aligning that then to the support that is available . estyn—now that is part of that accountability system . that is our method of holding schools and their governing bodies to account for their practice and for the work that they do . both systems , of course , are evolving . so , how we do categorisation has changed over a period of time . the elements that go into making that judgment around the levels of support have changed , and , of course , the estyn inspection regime is also changing . at the moment , schools are only inspected once every seven years . we 're moving to a system where estyn will be more regularly in schools . so , they are two systems , but they are different and they look at different things . but our categorisation system is how we look for those ways of identifying support for schools .",15,0.5,0.3684583306312561
0,0,"and you 've made , with feedback over the last few years , adjustments to the way that the categorisation system works . are you content with where it is now , or do you see more adjustments being made ? have you got things in front of you that you 're getting feedback on saying 'well , we need to tweak this again a little bit ' ?",15,0.5,0.27113232016563416
0,0,"so , that system has evolved over time . so , when it started , it was just a tool around secondary schools . now , it covers the breadth of schools . initially , on coming into office , when i first came in , it was purely driven by data , and it was also done in quartiles . so , there was a certain number of schools that had to be in the bottom , which drove practitioners mad . they were like 'ah , every year , there 's going to be some of us that have to be in the bottom quartile ' , because of the way in which it was arranged , which seemed very unfair to them . so , we 've changed that . it 's not just purely driven on data now ; there are other judgments—the professional judgments of our challenge advisers are taken into account . and i would expect that situation to continue to evolve to align itself to our curriculum reform , and our changes in self-evaluation . so , it 's not a fixed point . i expect that that system will continue to evolve and change , so that it complements and assists in the reform journey as other parts of the system change .",15,0.5,0.2569500803947449
0,0,"thanks for that . i think , for any impartial reader of the way that the trends have been going on this , there is some good news within that , in that , certainly , those schools that might have been identified as have been okay but coasting along , seem to be moving up the categories , although we still do have that— . well , it 's what the system is there to do , it 's to identify those schools that do need that additional support . and i like your analogy of a triage system—'you 're fit ; keep on doing what you 're doing and do it well ; you need more support , we 'll put the support in . ' but , can i turn to those schools that are causing significant concern , and how we identify them ? the estyn chief inspector 's conclusions at the end of the 2017-18 report that these schools are not being identified early enough—there 's a need to do something urgently about these concerns , particularly in secondary schools . have we addressed that ? are you content that we 've addressed that concern ? was he right ?",15,0.5,0.3970557451248169
0,0,"no , the chief inspector is absolutely right—absolutely right . i 've got no beef with that statement at all . in some ways , when a school goes into special measures , in a way , that 's a failure of the system , because that should have been identified sooner . so i 've got no beef , as i said , with the chief inspector saying that .",15,0.5,0.28672611713409424
0,0,"so just to ask , bearing in mind the earlier discussion we were having , how is it that we do n't identify those schools ?",15,0.5,0.32351750135421753
0,0,"that 's it—you 're quite right . undoubtedly , what categorisation has done is led to a greater understanding , i think , on behalf of local education authorities ' and school improvement services ' knowledge about their schools . i think knowledge around schools is greatly enhanced by that process . but we are not there yet in terms of necessarily , then , moving those schools more quickly , once they 've been identified as needing the highest level of support to see improvement . and secondary schools is a particular , particular challenge . so you will have seen from the last publication of categorisation data that our primary sector continues to improve—more and more and more of our primary schools are in a green rating , which is very satisfying to me . but we have got more of an issue with secondary schools , and we have a particular issue with the same schools being identified in that level of categorisation . so even though we 've identified them as needing that extra help , they are not moving at pace away from that system . so there are two things that we are doing at the moment . the first is , we are , again , looking at different sets of data that can give us even earlier warning systems that things are going wrong in a school—and perhaps steve will explain later . for instance , staff sickness , and carefully monitoring staff sickness , because there is a direct correlation between high levels of staff sickness in a school and what is going on in the school . and steve can explain some of this work later . but we 're piloting a new approach to those schools that are causing concern . each local authority has been asked to identify two of their high schools that they are particularly worried about . and we have a new multi-agency approach , working with those schools to try and move them more forward . so it 's two from each region , a multi-agency panel , working with the school . and that multi-agency panel includes the school itself , the local authority , the regional consortia school improvement staff , estyn and welsh government—as a multi-agency panel to support improvement in that school . so , for instance , what would normally happen , estyn would come in , estyn would make a judgment on the school—requiring special measures or urgent improvement—and estyn would go away . they 'd go away for six months , and then they 'd come back in six months , and they 'd make another judgment , 'no , still not good enough ' , and disappear for six months . we 're saying—estyn and the welsh government have agreed that 's not the best approach ; estyn need to be part of the solution , rather than just coming and making a judgment . the initial feedback from this trial is very , very positive . actually , we 've had local authorities coming to us and saying , 'can we put more schools in ? rather than just having two of our high schools , can we engage more in this project and this pilot ? ' it 's being evaluated by cardiff metropolitan university and swansea university , so we 're having some academic overview to see , actually , does this approach work , can we evidence it—that it actually makes a difference ? and it 's actually—i 'd like to claim all the credit for it , but it 's actually not dissimilar to something that 's happening in scotland as well . but we knew that carrying on doing the same old thing clearly was n't moving these schools , we needed a new approach , and this is what we 're doing at the moment . so it 's relatively new , but the initial feedback is positive . steve , i do n't know—",15,0.5,0.3536922335624695
0,0,"i think your important point is about , 'what about the schools that are sliding in that direction ? ' and it 's bringing together what we know from estyn , but also , critically , local authorities have knowledge of their schools , and so do consortia . we 've got to be better at bringing those together . so , the minister gave the example of staff sickness—not always a trigger , but it 's one of those . if you look at movement of pupils out of a school , you can look at complaints , you can look at , actually , emerging increased use of hr resources that a school pulls on a local authority . none of these have been pushed up into the public domain , but they 're important antennae . the point the minister made about estyn as well is , historically , when they go into special measures , estyn , at the end of that week , call in , historically , either the region or the local authority , they will feed back to one of them , and then they go away . so , they are staying with it . so , we are brining together the knowledge . but , as the minister said , we want to keep a very clear distinction between the accountability and the transparency to the public , to parents , with the very detailed collective work of that multi-agency group to actually make that difference over time .",15,0.5,0.2909732162952423
0,0,"okay . so , does that— . i 'd love to go further , but time is against us . does that deal with the issue of the schools that have been identified in those categories of requiring significant improvement and requiring special measures ? are those the ones that will be identified now , or is that above and beyond that again ?",15,0.5,0.32411253452301025
0,0,"well , those are the ones that are primarily at the forefront of our minds , but this way of sharing data better , to step in earlier , is part of our attempt to address what the chief inspector says about stepping in early—not waiting until a school gets into special measures and a formal judgment from estyn of that , but actually using that intelligence to get support in there earlier . the three elements that that multi-agency approach look at are : what are the fundamentals that need addressing in this school ? what is the capacity of the school itself to be able to address those fundamentals ? and , what extra support needs to go into that senior management team and the governing body to get those fundamentals addressed ? and actually , what does sustainable improvement look like ? because , again , one of the issues , sometimes , that happens is , a school goes into a category with estyn , there 's a big push and a big , 'we must do something ' and the school comes out , but actually , that improvement is not sustainable . it 's the low-hanging fruit ; it 's the easy wins that have been achieved , but actually , perhaps some of the fundamental challenges underlying in that school have n't been addressed in that process . so , this is about what will sustainable improvement look like in six months , what 's it going to look like in 12 months and what 's it going to look like in 18 months . so , actually , a more strategic , longer term approach to real change in a school rather than , perhaps , some of the easy-to-fix items that make a school as if it 's doing better , but we really have n't tackled some of the underlying problems that make that school vulnerable to slipping back . does that make sense ?",15,0.5,0.27310365438461304

0,0,"because you are moving to a more sophisticated approach in terms of identifying problems sooner , and so can offer the support earlier , is it time to think about moving away from the system of categorisation entirely ? that is , has the categorisation system reached the end of its usefulness , and is the multi-agency approach , this more sophisticated approach , a better way , ultimately , of being able to assist schools in moving forward ?",15,0.5,0.3403262495994568
0,0,"i think , siân , as i said earlier , the categorisation system has evolved over time , and my expectation is that it will continue to evolve , because it has to be consistent with our overall approach to school improvement and raising standards . i expect oecd will have feedback for us on this important part of our system , and we 'll wait to see exactly what they say about it , but as i said in answer to huw irranca-davies earlier , i have n't got a closed mind ; we 've demonstrated over the last four years our willingness to change the system to make it a smarter system , and we will continue to keep that under review , as we move forward . if i could just go back briefly , it does n't sound like a very exciting thing , does it , when we say we 've been doing work with the wlga , with cabinet members , but also scrutiny , because that 's a really important part of the jigsaw as well , is actually local government scrutiny of the performance of your education portfolio holder and the leadership of your council . so this is about trying to up the ante on all sides , so that those issues around 'what are you doing in your local authority to use the powers that you have ? ' you know , sometimes , making sure that everybody in that authority—those in power and those who are there to hold those in power to account—have the necessary skills , knowledge and understanding to do that appropriately .",15,0.5,0.3116357624530792

0,0,"yes , briefly . i only have one final question . we 've talked a lot about early identification ; getting in there and then managing the improvement , this triage approach there , and then getting some grip of it , as well , in doing all of that . but my question now is on what we currently have . i wo n't touch on the primary schools , but let 's just look at secondary schools—11 per cent of secondary schools inspected in the last two academic years judged as unsatisfactory , needing urgent improvement . there will always be secondary schools and primary schools that hit moments of crisis for one reason or another , but 11 per cent to me , and to any layperson , would seem unreasonably high . are you— ? it would be daft to ask you if you 're content . what is a level that you would be content with of having schools in red category in wales ?",15,0.5,0.3570328950881958
0,0,"you 're right . schools will need different levels of support at different points , and sometimes , it 's not because of a crisis . so , for instance , in my region , we do have an increase in the number of schools in the amber category . that 's because we 've seen in that particular region a number of headteachers retire because they 've reached retirement age , and there are new headteachers . well , that is a moment of risk in the school—when senior leadership changes . nothing else has changed in that school , but the simple fact that you have a new leader , sometimes in those cases it might be their first headship . that means that that school is going to need a little bit of extra support , so it is n't always just a crisis that needs extra support , there are just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it . but you 're absolutely right—we have a particular challenge in the secondary sector where we have not been able to move individual schools forward at pace . and 11 per cent is not acceptable to me , huw , which is why we have introduced this new pilot to address those schools where , persistently , we have concerns about their ability to move forward . if we 'd have carried on doing the same thing , i suspect we would have just carried on getting the same result—hence the need for a new approach to those schools that are causing concern .",15,0.5,0.3046339750289917
0,0,"very briefly , the things we talked about earlier was how we measure the performance of schools , particularly at gcses , with a narrow focus . as was said earlier , some of these are the same groups—they trip in and then they do n't come out . our belief is , from research , that they concentrate on squeezing the pips to get the grades up in some small areas for a period of time , and you can do that by targeting and immersing them . estyn can tick the box to say your grades have got better , but we have n't handled the serious underpinning issues—leadership , teaching and learning , and bringing those together . as the minister said , what does sustainable improvement look like in six , 12 , 18 months ? it is n't just , as important as they are , getting those exam grades up a bit . they 're the fundamental— . and if they 're all agreed as the indicators at the outset , we 're more likely— . so it 's multi-agency ; it 's not a little activity , it 's a major strategy .",15,0.5,0.2788052558898926

0,0,"the first thing to say , with regard to changes to performance measures—you 're right that change to those does make it , in some cases , more difficult to look at trends over a period of time . but those changes are made for really good reasons . if we change a performance measure , it is done to ensure that it is in the best interests of learners . and i think the best interests of learners always trumps the ease of comparison . i understand that , for researchers and for opposition members , even for ministers , it would be simpler to have the same set of measures over a period of time . but if we know that those things are driving behaviours that are unhelpful to children , and not in the best interests of children , then we have to change them , even thought that then does create challenges in different areas . with regard to what do we look at , there are a number of ways that we gain data and look at data in the system : everything from the categorisation system we spoke of earlier , and trends in categorisation ; we look at estyn reports ; we continue to look at examination results . but we 're trying to develop a broader range of data and statistics that give us a whole picture of the education performance , rather than narrowing down on one simple indicator that tells you one thing but does n't tell you everything . but i do n't know , steve , if there 's anything further that you 'd like to add .",15,0.5,0.4202192425727844
0,0,"it 's going back to what the member raised earlier , in terms of the range of things that you look at—things that can make a difference . so , when estyn review schools , or we 're looking to develop national frameworks for things like mental health and well-being , which look to the practice that enables raising standards , it 's collecting that information , both at a national level , through the annual review of estyn , as well as our engagement with regions and local authorities . so , it 's looking at the evidence base that goes beyond , but impacts on data . and , inevitably , we will use the programme for international student assessment , and any other external assessments that come through organisations like the oecd . and even where we 've changed the performance measures , we still have , at national level , the ongoing data . so , if you looked at level 2 plus , we believe it is important that children get five good gcses—for higher education and for employment . so , we 've not lost sight of those at a national level—we 're not using them as a narrow set of performance measures for individual schools .",15,0.5,0.2820182144641876

0,0,"well , i think the thing to say about the communications from welsh government , estyn , and the wlga is it 's not about not communicating the data , it 's about challenging people on how that data should be used . so , the data is still available , but it 's a challenge to them about how to use that data . so , for instance , when we 're presenting data that compares local authority to local authority , you could have a local authority that says , 'there we go , i 'm above the national average . i do n't need to worry about the education in my local authority , because i 'm above the average , or i 'm better than my neighbour . ' that does n't necessarily mean that everything is right in your local education authority . perhaps your children should be doing even better than what you 're presented with . so , actually , it 's not about hiding data ; it 's about how you use the data appropriately . and sometimes , how we were presenting data in the past was lulling some people into a false sense of security about the performance of their system . so , it 's about how you use data , and that 's what the communication from welsh government and the wlga and estyn was about : think very carefully about this data and what it 's telling you about your system , and do n't be lulled into a false sense of security that you may be doing brilliantly . or , perhaps , looking at your data , you may think , 'oh , my goodness me , we 're not doing very well at all ' , but , actually , more careful consideration of that might show that your school 's impact on those children is really , really a positive one . so , you 've got to use that data in the context . so , it 's not about less data . if anything , it 's about more data and , crucially for me , it 's about more intelligent use and interrogation of that data , about truly what it 's telling you about your system .",15,0.5,0.3750508725643158

0,0,"well , that cuts to what i was talking about . my preference—it 's a personal view—is that hypothecation does n't really help us too much . i mean , what we need to look at is whether the programmes , the sorts of programmes that are being funded in england , or indeed in scotland , are working effectively , and if they are , are they being delivered here in wales ? we have looked very carefully at the plans that england and scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight , and we 've made a comparison with what we 're doing in wales , and our ambition in wales is to go further than those nations , in many ways . but i come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system , indeed , about how much money , overall , are we putting into prevention .",15,0.5,0.47205543518066406

0,0,"it 's a very important question , and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that , around leadership and drive nationally . i 'm not interested in producing a strategy that sits on a shelf . if you look around the world , there are plenty of obesity strategies . you may notice , by the way , that we 've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy , because i think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in wales . but leadership will be really important , and we will need some sort of structure to lead this , to provide oversight . i 'm not a great believer in creating new structures , so we do need something that will give that drive , but the leadership comes from the top down . we need political commitment to this , and that 's why i welcome the input from this committee . so , that needs to be assured . and then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this , but it goes way beyond the public sector , of course , because we have to work with industry , and we have to work with communities , and we have to work with the public on this . so we need to think about our governance system for this and how we drive it forward . interestingly , we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care , but also involving the third sector and some members of the public , around how can we drive prevention more generally . it was n't specifically on obesity , but of course obesity came up because it 's such a pressing issue . this question of governance was discussed quite extensively , and we do have governance systems , of course , in wales . we have public services boards , we have regional partnership boards , and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important . but i 'd like to see—and i know i 'm a public health professional , so i know that only maybe 10 per cent , 15 per cent , possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system ; but i would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well . so i 'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this . so , we 'll need some sort of national oversight , absolutely , but we need local ownership and local leadership , too .",15,0.5,0.2994750142097473

0,0,"well , one of the questions that are often asked is : could we measure more on a longitudinal basis ? by that i mean in england , for example , children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11—at age 11 or 12. , that kind of age group . and so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what 's happening to children . i think that would be helpful to us in wales , and it 's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that . obviously , that would have significant resource implications , not just for the funding , but also for schools and for the system to deliver it . but it 's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation—the point that was made earlier .",15,0.5,0.33596354722976685

0,0,"i touched on that just now , but personally i do think it would be helpful to have more information . it 's always the case , there 's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information . so , the question of how it would be used would be really important . there is still a lot that we do n't know . we know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it , but we do n't really have a very clear understanding , in wales at least , of the point at which children start to become overweight . although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults , we do n't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years—what those changes are . so , it would help us to have some better understanding , which would help to direct some of our initiatives . i 'd be generally supportive of the principle . we 'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation , and it 's something that we need to give thought to , but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that , of course .",15,0.5,0.30342230200767517

0,0,"it may well be that there are things in wales that we might wish to legislate on , and you 've mentioned two of them , and they 're good examples . we would , obviously , need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and , in a way , we need to mirror what 's happening in england and in scotland to some degree around the consultations they 're having on energy drinks . we also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that . as to your question of legislative time , i 'm not really in a position to answer that . what i could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation . there may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on . the timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures , and i come back to the point that legislation , of course , is one of the tools that we 've got—we need to deploy them all .",15,0.5,0.2997761070728302
0,0,"sure , i understand that , that you could do other things . i know— . we 've heard from the government , on other calls for legislation , that the programme 's very tight , certainly for this term , so i was just wondering whether we might get that in , but okay . if i turn now to the planning system—and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of ; i 'd just welcome your view on this , because , when we discussed with stakeholders , we talked about whether the planning system , for instance , could be used to , as an example , restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on . would that be a measure that you would support , something like that ?",15,0.5,0.41253119707107544
0,0,"i think it 's definitely something we want to look at and , of course , that question is asked in the consultation , so we would like to know people 's views on that . it 's an interesting one . i think there is a question—a really important question—about how we can use the planning system more effectively . i 've discussed with nathan on a number of occasions , with planning colleagues in welsh government and in local authorities , about the art of the possible , let 's say . there may be things that we could think about and we want to get those ideas through the consultation . the specific question around takeaways , particularly takeaways near schools , is often asked . i was very interested to see , up in the north-east , some time ago , that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools , or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high . i understand london is now—some london boroughs are now—experimenting with that as well . so , that gave me comfort , because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively . i think my view at the moment is that the jury 's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they 're going to be . but the fact that we have some initiatives around the uk does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then , if it is shown to be beneficial , to think about that here in wales , yes .",15,0.5,0.3134006857872009
0,0,"sure , because it will only be one of a suite of measures anyway . of itself , it would n't address the problem , but , added to other initiatives , i guess it would . can i just ask you briefly , then , about community sport infrastructure and , in particular , of new schools ? so , welsh government , as you know , has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme . what we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently , particularly headteachers , was that , in some of the new schools that have been built , we have n't had changing rooms and toilet facilities , for instance , built into the new buildings . so , if we 're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public , actually , more active , do you think that 's something that we ought to be building in ? again , not your particular direct area of responsibility , but something that you might have an input into , is that , when we 're developing schools , we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public . is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around ?",15,0.5,0.4331023097038269
0,0,"well , it 's certainly a fascinating area and one that i think has a lot of potential . it goes— . you 're right to raise it in the context of schools , and i can understand why this committee would , but i think it goes beyond that , actually , into all developments in the public sector and how they 're developed and whether we 're building health into our environment , which perhaps is your starting point . one of the things that i was really pleased to see in terms of the public health ( wales ) act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool , and we 're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through government , but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using . and so i would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions . if you apply that kind of lens and you take the point , which is inherent in your question , i think , that schools are not just for kids , they 're for communities , then you would—it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way . so , on a personal basis , i would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres . there are all kinds of barriers in there , and i understand all of that , and it 's not really my field , exactly as you say , but , as a matter of principle , i think it 's a good one to pursue .",15,0.5,0.4847114384174347

0,0,"yes . you raised two issues , i think . one , about the difference between primary and secondary : i think what i 'm saying there is i think the fact that the new curriculum is going to be brought in for all the years in primary , but it 's going to be phased in year by year for secondary is a recognition of that difference . in terms of funding , probably everyone in this room , and certainly me included , would like to see more money for the education system—any educationalist would like to see that . but , you know , that is a decision for local and central government to decide how much they can afford . i think there is an argument for saying that the funding has become more challenging for schools over time .",15,0.5,0.38361790776252747

0,0,"i do n't think you can make that straightforward correlation . but if you do look at surpluses and reserves , they have been more or less constant for primary schools over a long period of time , but they have declined for secondary schools . so , i think there probably is an argument for saying that we need to look at the funding of secondary schools in particular because , overall , they 're in deficit now . so , i think there is an argument for looking at that . the other thing that 's worth saying about funding is that even a small decrease in real terms can be disproportionately time consuming to manage . so , you know , if you have a large school and you have to maybe make one member of staff redundant , it can have a real big effect on the morale in the school . but also the time it takes for the headteacher and the senior staff to make those decisions can take their eye off the educational ball because they 're looking at these financial and staffing issues .",15,0.5,0.3327718675136566

0,0,"yes . i think it will have an effect , but i think it 'll have a positive effect . i think the new curriculum , one of the things about the new curriculum is that it re-professionalises the profession . it gives back agency and ownership to teachers . i think it 's really important . and one of the reasons why teaching maybe has n't been that attractive a profession is that teachers in the past have just been delivering a set curriculum , and now they 've got a much more creative part in deciding for themselves how to teach something and what to teach . so , i think that is a very important part of attracting intelligent people into the profession . there are short-term things we need to do , of course , as well . i think we need to have a much more varied set of routes into teaching , so i welcome some of the part-time open university courses , for example . so , there are lots of ways—we were talking about maybe converting people from primary into secondary , particularly in welsh-medium , where there 's a shortage . so , all those kinds of varied routes , i think , into teaching , are important as well .",15,0.5,0.3233581483364105

0,0,"in terms of the secondary schools , that ’ s where the problem lies , isn ’ t it , rather than the primary sector . how much of a concern is it to you that children ’ s chances of going to a secondary school that is good or better appear to be 50:50 , and that , indeed , over 10 per cent of secondary schools are judged to be failing and 12 per cent are under estyn review ? how much of a concern is that to you ?",15,0.5,0.3081649839878082
0,0,"well , it is of concern to us , of course . i hope that we will have an opportunity to talk about the positive aspects of the education system in wales , because there are a number of good things we can report also . the primary sector , the special sector , post-16—there are many sectors that are doing well , and i think a story that 's particularly positive this year is that we have seen pupil referral units improving . we have seen examples of excellent practice in that sector for the first time in many a year , and we 've also seen excellent practice in independent special schools , which is also a sector— . because these are two sectors where there are very , very vulnerable children in attendance . so , i think that 's very encouraging . but , you 're right , of course , the biggest concern for the system , i would say , is secondary schools , and that is an issue of leadership , and also of the quality of the teaching and learning . those are the recommendations that we make most often in our inspection reports . so , i believe that there is a need to find a long-term solution , as i mentioned previously , and also a short-term solution to this problem . in the long term , to improve the quality of teaching and learning—well , that ’ s the main aim of the new curriculum . so , i am confident that that strategy is the right strategy . it will take time , as we mentioned previously ; it will take longer in secondary schools , and that 's for a number of reasons , and i have discussed the challenges that are additional for secondary schools in previous annual reports . so , there are many reasons why secondary schools find it more difficult , possibly , than primary schools . the children themselves are older and they have greater challenges . life is more complicated for them , possibly . it ’ s more difficult to engage with the parents of older children than younger children , and that ’ s an important factor . that ’ s one of the reasons why i believe it ’ s important that we do have community schools that ensure that the parents are part of the school ’ s life and take an interest in the education of their children . we also know that qualifications take a very prominent role in secondary schools ’ mindsets , and , in some cases , perhaps excessively so . so , we need to ensure that those qualifications are reformed as a result of the reform of the curriculum , and , of course , qualifications wales is carrying out that work currently . and also , we need to change the measures that we use to measure the schools ’ successes . now , there is work ongoing on that as well . but there are all kinds of variations and differences between the primary and secondary sectors . in primary schools , for example , the greatest and most obvious difference , i would say , is that you ’ ve got one teacher who looks after a child for a whole year , and that teacher can identify the needs of the pupil very well over a period of time , getting to know the child and , possibly , the family very well . it ’ s much more complicated for secondary school to do that ; there have to be systems put in place for that . so , there are many long-term things that we need to respond to . but in the short term , what is important is that those schools that cause concern receive much more support , and that is why i am glad and do welcome what 's being piloted currently , which is a system of supporting these schools , the multi-agency approach , that is . so , that is something that we have been calling for for quite a long period of time and piloted ourselves a few years ago . so , i 'm very glad that we are doing this in secondary schools throughout wales . i believe there are about 12 schools that are in that pilot scheme .",15,0.5,0.3196875751018524
0,0,you said previously that it 's a cause of concern for you that these schools that are failing or underachieving are not identified early enough . are there signs that that 's improving ?,15,0.5,0.2813485562801361
0,0,"well , one of the things that 's very positive about this pilot scheme is that it 's not just the schools that are officially causing concern that are a part of the pilot scheme , that is , the schools that we have identified , through inspections , as needing to be put in a statutory category . so , there are schools involved in the pilot scheme that the authorities and the consortia have identified themselves as schools that are at risk of causing concern . i believe that it 's fair to say that we have not reached a point yet where we have a system of agreed criteria in relation to identifying these schools yet . i think that there has been initial work that has been commissioned or that is about to arrive in relation to that , and the types of measures you would expect us to take account of would be dissatisfaction from parents , staff leaving , a change in leadership . we use surveys with the children , for instance , and that gives you quite a good idea of whether a school is possibly facing difficulties . so , there 's not one single criteria alone that will tell you , 'this is a school that is at risk of causing concern ' , but taken together , having a set of criteria that everyone has agreed would be a good way of monitoring schools , i believe .",15,0.5,0.399173766374588
0,0,"okay . well , we 'll be coming on to that middle tier later on , and perhaps that 's where the problem lies , namely that if there is n't an agreed system from consortia and yourselves , perhaps that 's where the focus needs to be .",15,0.5,0.29978442192077637
0,0,"i would say that it 's not the identification of the schools that is the greatest problem . the greatest problem is ensuring that there is support for them and that the support is multi-agency support , where all the agencies that support these schools are working together .",15,0.5,0.2917585074901581
0,0,"well , how long does it take , therefore , for a school to move from an improvement category , in terms of special measures , to be escalated then ? because one sees sometimes that there 's an excellent school , and within five years ' time , it 's in the red . so , there 's a great deal of variance in that .",15,0.5,0.32019856572151184

0,0,yes . perhaps claire can respond to this .,15,0.5,0.2988383173942566
0,0,"on average , secondary schools that are in need of special measures take just over two years , on average . some are shorter ; some are quite a considerable amount longer . it 's a little less for schools that go into significant improvement . with primary schools , of course , it 's much shorter because the issues are far less complex ; it 's easier to bring about improvements in teaching . when you 've got large numbers of staff , you 've got large secondary schools , it takes time to actually bring about those improvements , but it is a long time , just over two years , when you think that some pupils , maybe in key stage 4 for the two years— . certainly , we want to see schools coming out of category much quicker , and this is where the multi-agency approach certainly is a positive step . all partners involved in supporting the school are involved in these improvement boards . they focus on bringing about improvement in the areas of the school that are weakest , and it is the responsibility of everybody involved—that is : ourselves , the regions , local authorities , the schools themselves and their governing bodies—to look at how they can best support the school to bring about that improvement . so , it 's getting an agreement on what the issues are , and then planning the support so that we avoid duplication , but that we support the school in the areas they need more support . and we hope that this then will accelerate the improvement of the schools that find themselves in category . but , as meilyr already said , there are some schools involved in that particular pilot that are at danger of causing serious concern . so , the pilot is trying out those two different approaches as well .",15,0.5,0.3672395348548889
0,0,"okay , thank you . and just finally from me , for the time being at least , the financial situation ; we 've spoken about that already this morning . if you could— . if funding was injected into the system tomorrow , say , what would you spend it on ? what aspects would benefit from that additional funding ?",15,0.5,0.4568525552749634

0,0,yes . how would you use any additional funding that would flow into the school ?,15,0.5,0.3077152669429779
0,0,"it 's difficult to make that decision , because every school is different . it is important , of course , that leaders do have the power and the ability to make those decisions themselves . but , certainly , in the short term , the type of thing i would have thought would be to prepare for the new curriculum . that means freeing up teachers to think about what the new curriculum means to them . the schools that have been a part of developing the curriculum have been in a fortunate position in that they 've had plenty of time to think about this . so , it 's now time—and this was the chief message of my annual report this year—for every school in wales to start to think . because i think that the new curriculum is truly an opportunity to take a forward step in terms of how we teach and learn within schools . but that means that time is needed for schools to think this through and , in that thinking , to contact the community , to talk to their children as well , to see what the community in its broader sense would like to see being in the new curriculum , because it 's up to every school . although the new curriculum sets a framework , it is up to each and every school to decide what they 're going to teach , and what they 're teaching in order to prepare their young people for this new world that we have in the twenty-first century . therefore , to give you a somewhat superficial answer , i would be setting time aside for the training of teachers .",15,0.5,0.32771575450897217
0,0,"can i just add one thing there ? i think what we 've seen over the years recently is that local authorities , to some extent , have safeguarded the funding that goes to the schools , but the effect of that is that we 've seen less funding going into some of the local authority services ; for example , those services that support well-being , that promote attendance , and that perhaps support behaviour and assistance for schools . so , i think that all of those factors contribute to how schools can support and assist their pupils , and to improve themselves . so , i think that side of things is important as well—in the school or in the local authority , if funding is available , it should be allocated to all of those things so that those services can also support the children to succeed .",15,0.5,0.3167777359485626

0,0,"just before we move on to the middle tier , if i can just ask about the quality of teaching ? there 's been a consistent message from estyn that that is the weakest part of the system in wales . the government recognises that and has invested a very significant amount of money in that area , yet it 's still an issue again in your annual report . you have n't said whether it 's getting better or going in the right direction . what is your assessment of whether we are seeing the improvements we need to see in the quality of teaching ?",15,0.5,0.36062395572662354

0,0,"we have n't directly inspected the regional consortia since—i think 2017 was the last time we did some direct monitoring with them . but i think , over the last three years , we do feel that they 've improved their knowledge . they 're still relatively new in the big scheme of things . so , they did take a little while to embed , and i think that came across when we did the work that we did with them back in 2017. but , more recently , they 've improved their knowledge of individual schools ' strengths and areas for improvement , and they are using this knowledge better to support and challenge schools , and particularly schools causing concern . but obviously , as we 've been talking about this morning , there 's still work to do . i think they 've prioritised well the work that schools are doing around literacy and numeracy , but their support for schools to develop digital competence has been a bit weaker . even though we 've had the framework as an early part of the curriculum developments there , we have n't seen quite the focus that we 've seen on other areas . i think for schools causing concern , what we found—and we do look at their work through our local authority inspection , so we are getting some first-hand evidence of their impact through that—they 're not always focused , in those schools causing concern , on improving teaching and learning , so actually getting in and looking and working with teachers and with staff to actually make improvements there . i think , generally , their support for secondary schools has had less impact across the consortia than it has for primary schools , and i think sometimes that 's because they 're struggling to recruit appropriate specialists , to support with secondary , or perhaps they do n't have the depth of strong practice that we talked about earlier within their region . so , they 're having to work a bit harder to find effective practice , to share practice and to get the secondary expertise and knowledge to support those schools . we will be , over the next year , looking specifically at the work of consortia to support curriculum reform work . well , we think we will be—we haven ’ t had our remit letter yet . but that 's one of the areas we 've discussed , about doing some specific work on over the next year to look in a bit more depth .",15,0.5,0.3747324049472809

0,0,"well , regional consortia are n't actually statutory entities at the moment , and we do n't have specific inspection powers relating to regional consortia . what we have are powers to inspect school improvement . so , on each of our local authority inspections , there will be , usually , an area that we 're looking at that relates to school improvement , and that would involve us looking at the work of the consortia that the local authority has commissioned . what we 've agreed with welsh government is that , over the next few years , we will take a thematic approach . so , the first area that we 've said is that we 'll look specifically at how each of them is supporting curriculum reform , and report on that . so , that will report specifically on the different ones , but it would n't be the same as doing an inspection of their work at this time .",15,0.5,0.29256966710090637

0,0,"well , i think that 's something to be discussed over the next few years . there 's , obviously , local government legislation that has been debated recently , which has the potential to create corporate joint committees , and school improvement was one of the areas that is being considered there . so , there may be an opportunity , if that 's created , to think how we then adapt inspection to look specifically at that . so , i think there is an opportunity . i think we do get a handle on their work through the local authority and , ultimately , it 's looking at what that consortia brings to that local authority and to the schools and the pupils in that area that 's the important bit , i think , ultimately , to see the impact there . so , we are looking at them in that way , and then taking that thematic approach , but we 'll keep reviewing it over the next couple of years .",15,0.5,0.3149411976337433
0,0,"thank you . and what are estyn 's views on the latest position regarding regional working in south-west and mid wales ? would it be preferable for school improvement advisers to be based in the consortium , education through regional work , rather than each local authority employing their own , as is the case at present ?",15,0.5,0.24393147230148315
0,0,"if i can just go back to the last question as well , what we did in order to inspect regions was we paused our local authority inspection cycle back in 2014 , i think , for about three years . so , then , we spent time looking at regions , basically , because we did n't have the resource to do both at the same time . so , we 're in negotiation with welsh government currently , so that , going forward , we can look at local authorities and regions at the same time . if regions become statutory entities , that would be in legislation , and then you could have legislation that gives us directly the powers to inspect them , which we do n't currently have . so , we have to , effectively , wait for welsh government to ask us to do that work . but , as jassa said , currently , what we intend to do in the short is to do some thematic work on that . in terms of erw , they were the region that , at the end of the last cycle of regional inspections , we were still monitoring . we are concerned about their progress , particularly in the light of recent developments . so , for example , the chair of the joint committee has resigned , the managing director remains a temporary appointment and there are no clear plans for a permanent leadership . some of the leadership team have left—the capacity has gone down—and various staff that were appointed last summer have already left . the budget has not been agreed and certain key meetings—executive board and joint committee meetings—have been cancelled . so , we are particularly worried about erw , and , because of that , we will be going in to visit them in april—next month—and we 'll be visiting all of the authorities to make sure that they do have a plan for an appropriate school improvement service going forward . but , jassa , probably , can say a little bit more about our plans there .",15,0.5,0.45493873953819275
0,0,"yes , i think you asked a specific question about , you know , which is better . i think our view has been that , generally , the local authorities are too small to deliver that whole range of school improvement services , particularly given the national reform agenda at the moment . we felt last summer , when we went to erw , that they 'd managed to reach the best possible model , given the constraint they 've placed , collectively , on themselves—that they want to deliver aspects of school improvement locally , through the local authorities , and have some central capacity . so , we felt that , given that they wanted to do some locally and some centrally , enough thought had been put into that structure last summer and that it could be workable . there were key aspects such as support for secondary schools causing concern and there was some capacity centrally that could support areas such as powys . unfortunately , as meilyr has described , some of those aspects have since been disbanded or those staff who were on secondment have gone back , so i think it is a key risk , particularly for some of those authorities you 've talked about that are causing concern , such as powys or pembrokeshire—that they have n't necessarily got that local capacity to support their schools causing concern . so , you 've got some concerns within school capacity and you 've got concerns about local authority capacity , and what you do n't have there now is that collective capacity centrally that might support them . so , that 's why we 're going to go and do a slightly more detailed link visit to try to understand how they are mitigating the risks that we see are arising as a result of some of those things that have happened recently . our understanding is that there 's a joint committee meeting of erw on 19 march , so , hopefully , after that point , we 'll have a little bit more information about how they 're planning to manage that collective set of services going forward—it 's a little bit of an unknown at the moment .",15,0.5,0.3786081373691559
0,0,"you were asking , 'would it be better for every authority to have their own team ? ' but , before regions were invented , if you like , we were saying consistently that they tended to be too small . what happened in practice was that authorities did come together voluntarily to have joint advisory services . so , you had cynnal in the north west , you had the education and school improvement service , you had gwent—so , they naturally did come together in groups , maybe a little bit smaller than the current regions , but they , of their own accord , produced something not very dissimilar to a region .",15,0.5,0.4841932952404022

0,0,"i think literacy has been , and still is , and still needs to be a top priority . i mean , literacy clearly is something that underpins the rest of education , so it really does need to be a top priority . i think it has been a high priority , but we need to continue prioritising it . we 've seen some improvements over the years . for example , we 've given a lot of attention to writing over the years , and making sure that children get the opportunity to write in an extended way , not just short sentences , but having the opportunity to have extended writing , and there 's some evidence that that now is beginning to have an effect . but almost ironically , the same sort of issue is true of reading . so , it 's not just reading small little snippets—we need to encourage children to have a love for reading and read whole books . so , i gave a little bit of attention to that in the annual report—that that needs attention . i think the other thing i would emphasise is that this is not just for the foundation phase , it 's not just for very young children—it 's really important at key stage 2 and in secondary school . one of the things we have been worried about , and i think there was some reflection of this in pisa , is that there are strengths in reading in wales . so , pisa , for example , said that children in wales are very good at comparing lots of little snippets , but what they 're saying , and they 're saying this themselves , is that the love of books is decreasing , and the number of children who read regularly whole books . so , i think there is something there for teachers to set and model a good example , to show their own interest in reading , to encourage children to read themselves .",15,0.5,0.3520931005477905

0,0,"there are a number of parts to that . firstly , in terms of long-term social services intervention in a family 's life , i think , for people to be fully aware of the very few numbers of families where we have long-term intervention currently , even where there is what would be perceived as very significant abuse . what we do is we go in for short periods in families ' lives , to support them to work with their strengths , to work with them and their family members . it 's not about us going into families , whatever some of the public perception may be . our aim is to get in and get out . so , in terms of long-term intervention , what we want is for families to find their own solutions . we want families to be able to work with each other , and together , and local community support , and preventative services , to be able to address issues . this is not about punitive approaches from social services . so , that 's the first element . in terms of thresholds for children 's services , we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us . there may be a small number of referrals that come through . what we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle . we recognise that 's likely to happen . because we also know that this is actually quite a rare occurrence currently ; this is not a defence that 's being used with great frequency , this is not something that is happening . and if we look at the data , we know that the incidents of children , and the number of parents who now recognise this as an acceptable form of punishment , has steadily declined over the last 15 to 20 years . so it 's diminishing as it is .",15,0.5,0.34648746252059937

1,0,"no , i have not been given a date . what i have done today is publish the principles that will aid me in , as you said , me making a decision . so , clearly , we will be relying on the advice of our medical and scientific advisers , but the principles are very clear . firstly , we will need to consider any decision to have more children returning to school in the context of the safety and the physical and the emotional well-being of children and young people and the staff . obviously , i ca n't make a decision regarding education in isolation . it will have to be taken in the context of the wider welsh government response to dealing with this pandemic . thirdly , it is absolutely crucial in making any decisions that we have clearly communicated that to parents and to staff , on the information that we have used to reach any decisions , to build confidence for parents and professionals , but also to give them time to plan . it will be impossible to move quickly to new ways of working . and we also have to look at—and it 's been paraphrased quite a lot today—if we are looking at certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting , which groups they should be . and , finally , how do we operationalise that ? how do we make those settings as safe as they possibly can be , and how do we tackle some of the difficult challenges of everything from ensuring that we have adequate numbers of workforce available , to the very real questions about how you would do social distancing in the context of education , school transport issues , how you would avoid people gathering at the school gate , for instance ? so , there are very practical issues that would need to be considered and thought through very , very carefully before we could return , before what we could see is a move from where we are now to the next phase of education , and new approaches to what schooling may look like . but , again , i must be absolutely clear to you , members of the committee , and to people watching : it is not feasible , in this sense , that we would move from where we are now to what all of us would regard as normal education and what the operation of schools looked like before the start of this pandemic .",15,0.5,0.517997145652771
0,0,"so , what is clear from what you 've said is that it 's going to be phased return . i would assume that would be the most vulnerable—perhaps additional learning needs pupils would return first . just reading some of the things that you 've said today , can you answer that question ? and can i also ask : you said that guiding principle no . 3 will be having the confidence of parents , staff and students , based on evidence and information , so they can plan ahead . what will that evidence and information be , and how will you know that you 've got the confidence of parents to return ?",15,0.5,0.2825203835964203
0,0,"well , as i said , primarily , we will need to take a lead from our scientific and medical advisers . i want to also say that we are obviously working on a four-nation basis and keeping in very close contact with my counterparts in northern ireland , scotland and england . but we 're also looking beyond the united kingdom to approaches to education in the face of this pandemic . members are aware that we as a nation are a member of the atlantic rim collaboratory . so , recently i was able to talk to educationalists and ministers in iceland , other parts of europe , north america , south america and australia . so , we 're also looking at best international evidence in this regard . and , clearly , we will need to be very clear , as today is an attempt to be very clear with parents and our teaching professionals , and the unions that represent them , about the basis of that evidence .",15,0.5,0.25261247158050537

1,0,"thank you , suzy . as i said in my statement earlier today , returning to school will not be a return to normal , and in recognition of this , i 've already made it clear that i will seek , in all opportunities , to reduce the burdens on school . that includes various data collection , the suspension of performance measures and removing the requirement to undertake literacy and numeracy testing , and , clearly , school attendance will want to be an important factor of that .",15,0.5,0.5131480693817139

0,0,"thank you once again for that . the smooth operation of the hubs , with regard to health and safety , is , of course , of paramount importance . what we have seen since schools closed for traditional statutory purposes and moving to their repurposed function—we have seen a change of pattern over time . so , following my announcement on , i believe , 18 march , the week after , we saw a large number of settings open and operating . as local authorities have been able to understand the demand for those places—from critical workers and vulnerable children—we have seen more local authorities move to a hub model , and we have been able to publish guidance to local authorities on how issues around safe working in those hubs should be followed , and we 've been able to give guidance in that regard . local authorities are asked by us to report any incidents where they are concerned about operation issues on the ground .",15,0.5,0.39258092641830444

0,0,"thank you , chair . just following on from your answer to siân gwenllian earlier about the number of vulnerable children in school , what 's being done specifically to facilitate more of those children coming into a school setting or hub at the moment ? i 'm thinking about the 600 you 've talked about , and i know , in one of my local authority areas of merthyr , which is a very small authority , we 're talking about the number of children identified as vulnerable running into thousands , not hundreds , and that 's just in one authority . so , this is a particularly difficult issue to address , i appreciate , but how are we going to get more of these children into the hubs ?",15,0.5,0.4593483805656433
0,0,"okay , dawn . the first thing to say is that the issue of vulnerable children attending settings is one that is a challenge to not just wales , but also to my colleagues in northern ireland , scotland and england . i 'm pleased to say that we are working across government departments—myself , obviously , and colleagues in education—with colleagues in social services to have a cross-government approach to these issues . i think the first thing to say is that these are complex messages , because the overriding public health message from our government has been to stay at home and children should be kept at home as much as possible , and to make sure that our hubs run smoothly , safely and effectively , we do need to limit the number of children who are attending those hubs . so , firstly , the fact that numbers are small is in some ways a success of our public health messages , because parents have been heeding those messages , but , of course , all of us will have concerns for some children who remain at home . so , i 'm pleased to say that we have seen a doubling in the last week of the number of children . so , although numbers are small , they have doubled over the course of the last week . we 're working with local authorities and they have assured us that children and young people with a social worker have been risk assessed on a multi-agency basis and are receiving support in a number of ways , and that includes having conversations about some of those children attending the hubs . they 're also looking to support in other ways . of course , some of our children who would be classed as vulnerable—and our definition of 'vulnerable ' is one that is shared between the systems in england and wales—could be children with a statement of special educational needs . for some of those children who , perhaps , have very intense health needs , actually , staying at home is the appropriate thing for that child and that family to do , and we 're looking to support families , and local authorities and local education systems are looking to support families , in a number of ways . we also know that just because you do n't have a social worker or a statement of special educational needs does not mean that a child may not be vulnerable , and schools are very aware of the needs of those children and have been carrying out regular telephone check-ins where they can—if the age of the child is appropriate—just to keep in touch with those families and those individual children . but we will continue to work across government to encourage , where it is appropriate , children to attend settings , and , if it is not appropriate for children to be in a setting , that there is contact with those children and young people to ensure that they remain , and their families remain , supported .",15,0.5,0.25444626808166504
0,0,"thank you , minister . it 's encouraging to hear you talk about the ongoing safeguarding of children that are at home and i assume , within that , appropriate referral mechanisms are still in place if teachers or anybody has any particular concern about a child . similarly , with special educational needs , whereas some of those children benefit clearly from a one-to-one provision in a school , and they may not respond as well to remote working , or remote contact , with an sen advisor , are you considering in any way any relaxation of the lockdown rule in particular for those children in terms of them being able to access the support that they need for their particular educational needs ?",15,0.5,0.3606679439544678
0,0,"well , first of all , dawn , you 're absolutely right : my expectation is that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children , and schools should continue to refer children to children 's services if they have any concerns , and that would also , of course , be the case for youth workers who may be keeping in contact with children . so , there is a professional expectation on all those that are working with our children and young people that , despite the circumstances they find themselves in , they should continue to report and refer cases if they see anything or hear or are told anything that makes them concerned about a child 's welfare and safety . with regard to children with additional learning needs , i am aware that that can present a number of challenges to families and children , and perhaps steve davies could give some further details . we have been keen to work with local authorities to ensure specialist provision , where that is appropriate—so , if i could give you an example of my own local authority in powys , they have two specialist centres available for children with more profound additional learning needs , and those centres are available—recognising , however , that , even with the provision of specialist hubs , it can be a challenge for some children with additional learning needs to find themselves outside of a routine . hubs are often staffed on a rota basis and therefore children could be faced with staff that they are unfamiliar with . so , even when local authorities—and the vast , vast majority of them do—have specialist services in place , sometimes that might not be the best thing for a child 's health and well-being . but perhaps steve can give us further details of the conversations that have been taking place with directors of education to ensure that children with additional learning needs have access to the hubs and specialist support . steve .",15,0.5,0.3265901803970337

0,0,"you 're right , dawn : we have to consider how we can support children not only in their learning during this time , but also to recognise the very real impact that the pandemic will have on all of our mental health and well-being—recognising , of course , it is absolutely natural for all of us , including children and young people , to have fears and anxieties at this time . that 's a natural reaction to the situation that we find ourselves in . but , of course , there are issues around those children that would have currently been receiving school counselling , and also being able to be in a position to respond to a potential growth in the number of children that are receiving support . so , the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families . in the immediacy , of course , that will have to be done in different ways than perhaps we 've traditionally delivered services in the past , because of social distancing and lockdown rules , but we want to get some of these systems in place now , rather than waiting for everything to go back to normal . we need to be able to plan to offer services in the here and now , but also be able to plan for what potentially could be an increase in the demand of those services . so , we 've been in close touch with local authorities , asking them what they believe that they will need and how they can use additional financial resources , and we 've been very pleased to be able to secure that for them .",15,0.5,0.27310675382614136
0,0,"so , that would include things like telephone and video support as well , i guess , then .",15,0.5,0.3501187264919281
0,0,"yes , absolutely . so , that would include remote counselling as in a fashion that we 're doing now , but also , as and when some of the restrictions are perhaps removed , looking at an enhanced family therapy , or a therapy approach . so , when we talk about counselling , i think it 's important to recognise that there will be some flexibility around this money and it does not necessarily mean that local authorities have to use it on a one-to-one basis . that might not be appropriate for some children , especially our younger children and their families , and they can use that money to provide counselling or therapy—in the widest possible terms—that is the best method to support individual children and their families . but , clearly , we 're having to do that in the confines of lockdown and social distancing at the moment . some of that money can also be used to support the professional learning and the professional development of counsellors , because , of course , they may be being asked to work in a different way and we need to make sure that they have the appropriate skills and abilities to do that .",15,0.5,0.22652915120124817

0,0,"oh , thank you . my question goes back to the comment you made earlier , minister , about the number of children doubling—sorry , vulnerable children doubling—after the easter break , if we can call it that . so , what i 'm after is a sense of churn in these establishments . so , was that figure a recovery of a number of children that had been there before the easter break , and are the people who are there still the same people as were there right at the beginning of the crisis and the lockdown ?",15,0.5,0.48021116852760315
0,0,"suzy , what i believe that we 're seeing in our schools is new pupils coming into school . so , there has been , i know , a real effort on behalf of educationalists and social services staff to really reach out to families and to make sure that they 're aware of the support that is available out there for them and their children , and to be able to give them the confidence that there are—that the hubs are available for them . so , we have seen an increase in children . those numbers are still small and , i believe , potentially , there is an opportunity to build on that and to have further conversations with families about the support that is available for vulnerable children , whether that— . that vulnerability , of course , can cover a whole range of issues . as i said when we last met , this is a constantly evolving situation . the initial response—local authorities and schools worked incredibly fast and incredibly quickly to set up these hubs . we 've seen an evolution in the weeks since that time and i am sure that we will continue to see some evolution in approaches .",15,0.5,0.29293954372406006

0,0,"yes , my last question is really about the potential for the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers . is that a concern for you ? i 'm thinking particularly in relation to those less affluent families in having access to technology and so on . what kind of concerns do you have about that and what are we looking to do to try to ensure that that does n't actually play out ?",15,0.5,0.36239948868751526
0,0,"thank you , dawn . all of the statistics would tell us that learning loss and the gap , potentially , will affect those more vulnerable children the most . clearly , we will want to consider that as we think about what the new normal for education may look like , or as we develop into future phases . depending on where that child is in their educational journey , of course , the needs and the potential for loss are slightly different . so , for instance , when we 're thinking about very young children , we could be thinking about a lack of social interaction and the development of oracy skills . of course , that , potentially , then will have a knock-on to their ability to learn to read and then to write , for instance . for other children who are , perhaps , older and heading towards formal examinations , the challenge when they return to school will be a slightly different one . i 'm not sure , chair , whether you want me to give some further details about our continuity-of-learning plan and how we are looking to address digital disadvantage now , or whether there are questions later .",15,0.5,0.2691315710544586
0,0,"well , i 've got a question on that coming up , so , if it 's okay , dawn , we 'll go on to that now . before we do that , i was just going to ask how the welsh government is paying due regard to the united nations convention on the rights of the child and , obviously , the right children and young people have to an education . i was going to ask you about the risk of inequality due to varying access to digital resources , which are so important in ensuring continuity of learning .",15,0.5,0.4262853264808655
1,0,"you 're absolutely correct , chair . officials are very aware of our responsibilities towards children 's rights in this regard and we are doing whatever we can to ensure that children have an equal opportunity and have equal access to learning at this time . we are fortunate in the regard that , because of previous decisions and investments , we have a strong base on which to build because we have our hwb digital learning platform and because we have invested heavily in the national purchasing of microsoft office and google for education tools , which are available to all families . we have become the first , i think—we 're certainly the first in the uk , and i 'm not sure whether we 're the first across the world , but i think we probably are—to deploy , for instance , adobe spark nationally . but , obviously , access to hardware and connectivity is crucial at this time . officials are working with local authorities to ensure that all children have access to both the hardware and the connectivity they need to be able to participate in digital learning at this particular time .",15,0.5,0.5697582364082336
0,0,"okay , thank you . just a final question from me : how exactly are we communicating to parents what the expectations are of them in terms of delivering this education at home now ? are there , for example , guidelines on recommended hours of home learning per day of the week or volume of work to be completed ? how are we ensuring that parents know how best to lead their children through this at the moment ?",15,0.5,0.24789130687713623

0,0,"your comment , minister , on working with local authorities to make sure that individuals have hardware : can you just give us a bit of detail on what working with local authorities actually means ? in the process of that , is there any data gathering going on for those pupils who are being educated at home and the levels at which they 're engaging ? you know , are they sticking with it , or how many are dropping out ? because i think the two of those perhaps go together .",15,0.5,0.3448987901210785
0,0,"yes , absolutely . so , i 'm hoping to make an announcement tomorrow , if not later on this week , about some specific details around support for hardware and connectivity . we 're working closely with local authorities to understand just that : to understand from the schools the number of schools that—and a number of them have already done this—have been lending chromebooks , ipads and laptops to children , and also identifying children who are not perhaps engaging in the activities that have been made available . and we 'll be doing two things to support local authorities . the first is to use the stock of equipment that they already have to be able to provide hardware to students . so , we have purchased on a national basis software that , when applied to an old piece of kit , essentially turns it into an out-of-the-box chromebook . because , as you can imagine , just like other things during a pandemic , there has been a rush to buy new stuff on the market and then there is a scramble and nobody can get what they need . so , we 're utilisng kit that is already available in schools and local authorities , and we will look to backfill that to schools at a later point out of our edtech investment programme . the other issue is , once a child has a chromebook or a laptop or a device , issues around connectivity . so , we 're also looking to purchase on a national level and distribute mi-fi connectivity , so students will be able to have access to wi-fi where they do n't have that already . that 's why we need to work closely with local authorities and schools to identify the level of that need and to make sure the stuff gets to the right children . one of the ways in which we are able to do that is to look at engagement in education . so , if a child has n't been engaging , is that because they just do n't want to and they 're voting with their feet—but clearly teachers need to have a conversation about that—or is that because the child simply does not have the ability to do that , and therefore we need to get that stuff out to those children ? so , rather than just simply leaving it to local authorities to scramble around in a very crowded market to get the stuff that they will need , we 're trying to do that on a national basis and deploy that to local authorities . so , our officials have been having conversations with each of our local authorities to ascertain what 's already happened , and there is very good practice out there—schools have been proactive—but where there are gaps , what can we do as a national government to be able to assist them to do that ? we are repurposing some of the resources that we had previously identified for our edtech investment , using those resources to fill this particular gap .",15,0.5,0.31085890531539917

1,0,"good morning . thank you , chair . good morning , deputy minister . of those individuals who responded to our written consultation in a personal capacity , nearly 70 per cent do not support this bill . we also heard a clear message from the parents we met last week who oppose this bill that , as parents , they understand clearly the difference between child abuse and a light smack from a loving parent . how would you like to respond to that ?",15,0.5,0.5083978772163391
0,0,"thank you very much , janet , for that question . i think i 'd like to start by saying that child abuse is not the issue that the bill is trying to address . what the bill is trying to do is prohibit all forms of physical punishment , and that is in order to protect children 's rights and to ensure that children have the same protection from physical punishment as adults . but i do understand that people have different views , and that 's why this process has been so important—for us to hear what your views are and what parents ' views are . i know that , often , people use different euphemisms really to make light of physical punishment . i 've heard expressions used such as a 'light smack ' or a 'loving smack ' or a 'tap ' , and really there can be different interpretations of what is a 'light smack ' , what is a 'loving smack ' , and that does n't really cover the issue of the frequency of such actions being taken . but i would say that , however mild it seems to be , the united nations committee on the rights of the child recognises that any physical punishment of children , however minor , is incompatible with their human rights , and why should a big person hit a little person ? that 's been the sort of mantra , really , that has taken me through supporting this legislation—that it just seems wrong to me that there is something in the law that could mean that there could be an excuse for that happening . i believe we should n't have anything in the law that defends the physical punishment of children , and i do n't think we should be defining acceptable ways of hitting or punishing children , because i think it does send a confused message to children . it says , 'it 's okay for me to hit you , but do n't you hit anybody else . ' i think it causes confusion . so , i 'm confident that updating the law will make it much clearer for parents and people working with children—and , of course , i 'm sure , as you 'll have heard from the evidence you 've taken , that people who work with children are overwhelmingly in support of this legislation , and the representative surveys that we 've carried out show support for the bill 's principles .",15,0.5,0.3963288366794586

0,0,"okay . oh , yes . several consultation responses refer to statistics from sweden , which they say show that child-on-child violence actually increased by 1,791 per cent between 1984 and 2010 , following the ban on physical punishment in 1979. what is your view on these figures and how can we be certain that this bill wo n't lead to other long-term negative outcomes in wales ?",15,0.5,0.4109841585159302
0,0,"well , i 'm aware of the debate surrounding the interpretation of the different statistics from sweden . what 's happened , really , in the academic research is that different academics are focused on different figures to support their views , and the methodological ways of doing it makes it quite difficult to have causation . i was very encouraged that a recent study of 88 countries concluded that if a country prohibits corporal punishment , the result is association with less youth violence , and this is one of the largest cross-national analyses of youth violence , with more than 400,000 participants . so , there is other evidence , very widespread evidence , which looks at a whole range of people , that is in contrast to the swedish evidence . but , evidence in this field is mixed and we have considered a wide range of research and reviews , but ultimately the decision is one that is based on our commitment to children 's rights .",15,0.5,0.3183254301548004

0,0,"thank you , chair . i 've just got a couple of questions on this balance between the steps that will be needed to implement this bill and the impact that it 'll actually have . you 've probably heard in evidence that we 've received that there are still some concerns out there about how agencies might address malicious reporting ; some detail about how the public interest test might be applied further along the line ; what 's going to happen with out-of-hours provision from social services , and so on . there are still , from our perspective , quite a few things that are unknown about the effect on our public services in particular of the implementation of this bill . would you agree that perhaps we should know a little bit more about that before we proceed with supporting the bill ?",15,0.5,0.4137069284915924
0,0,"well , it 's very difficult , bringing in this legislation that has n't been done before . it 's very difficult to gauge the impact , and we 've covered that , i know , in previous discussions . but i think it 's very important to say that we are not creating a new offence . the bill is removing a defence to an offence of common assault . and i think it 's an interesting point to make that , in ireland , they introduced similar legislation through an amendment to a bill , and had no detailed preparation for bringing in the bill , and in fact there 's no evidence that this has caused any difficulties , and no significant negative impacts or increase in workload . but in any case , we have our implementation group , which is going to address many of these issues . this met on 14 may . that was the first meeting . you see , i think we do have to take a balance between assuming this bill is going to go through and what we can actually do . we ca n't presume that the assembly will accept this bill , so we have to be staged in what we do . but we had the first strategic implementation group on 14 may , and we had representatives from the police , the police and crime commissioners , the crown prosecution service , the association of directors of social services cymru , the association of directors of education in wales , the welsh local government association , the legal profession and the third sector . they 're all there , and they 're all very keen to make this legislation work and to look at the implications of it . i 'd just like to say how grateful i am for all those organisations giving their time and commitment . they 've set up four work streams , looking at parenting advice and support ; data collection , evaluation and monitoring ; operations , procedures and processes ; and out-of-court disposals and diversions . these groups will be taking forward this work and will be looking at many of those issues that you 've mentioned , and will also be updated on the progress of the awareness strategy that we will be bringing in . i 'm really confident that the legislation will be implemented in a very practical and workable way , because we do have the commitment of all these agencies , and there 's been a huge amount of preparation done in the welsh government to prepare for this in a way that , i have to say , has n't been done in some of the other countries—as i mentioned , in ireland . so , as much preparation as could be done is being done and has been done , but we really now see that the implementation group is taking forward all these issues , and obviously those agencies that are taking part in the implementation group are , on the whole , in support of the principles of this bill .",15,0.5,0.3107122480869293
0,0,"well , thank you for that , minister , but the way i look at this is that you 've already said that , if this bill passes—and it will pass ; it 's in enough manifestos to pass , so the question is what type of bill is going to pass—and if there is a gap of , let 's say , two years before anything is implemented , and the implementation group is doing the work that you 've described—and we 're very relieved to hear that—why is this bill being introduced now when that implementation group has n't really come up with a strategy that could help persuade people about what implementing this bill would look like in real life ? you 're asking the welsh public to take a bit of a chance on this .",15,0.5,0.41617169976234436

1,0,"okay , thank you , minister . can i ask about the powers under the school standards and organisation ( wales ) act 2013 , to ask you to tell us about the use of those powers either by welsh government or by local authorities , and how effective you feel that legislation has been ?",15,0.5,0.5004609227180481
0,0,"okay . well , as you 'll be aware , local authorities have quite extensive powers of intervention in schools if they feel that is necessary . if i 'm honest , i think there 's a mixed picture , with some local authorities using those powers not on a regular basis , but obviously demonstrating a willingness to use those powers . there are other local authorities who do n't seem to have used them . since that legislation came into being , there have been a number of reasons , because of course a local authority has to give a reason for using those powers of intervention . they usually focus on standards , but sometimes they focus on a breakdown in governance arrangements , perhaps , or a failure or a breakdown in financial management . so , sometimes the budgetary issues trigger an intervention power . and the types of interventions that have been used have included , in some cases , appointing additional governors to governing bodies , or suspending a school 's delegated budget so the local authority takes on , then , financial control of that particular school , or sometimes applying to the welsh government to entirely replace a governing body and establish an intervention board . so , if i can give you an example of where that 's been used and has been successful , in flintshire . they applied to welsh government for two interim executive boards , in sir richard gwyn catholic high school and in ysgol trefonnen . they applied to us . those governing bodies were dissolved . the iebs were put in place and both of those schools , which had been in special measures , moved quite rapidly , actually , out of special measures . perhaps the most recent example of this is one that the chair will know very well in her own constituency of torfaen , in cwmbran high school , where torfaen has intervened in that case . the welsh government has not used those powers to date . my expectation always is that local authorities should be the first port of call , and i would encourage—and we always encourage—local authorities to take a proactive approach to intervention and to use those powers . but it 's my belief that it is they who are best placed initially to do that .",15,0.5,0.36595404148101807

0,0,"so , this brings us back to the principle of self-evaluation and something , if we 're honest , we 've not been very good at . if you look at a number of chief inspectors ' reports into the welsh education system , self-evaluation has always been identified as something that is missing or underdeveloped in our system to date , hence , then , the work to establish not a new approach , but a more robust approach to self-evaluation . we 've done that in conjunction , again , with the oecd , middle tier and practitioners . it 's really important , throughout the entirety of our reform journey that that 's done in co-construction , because we want this resource to be usable in schools . so , it 's all very well having a conceptual idea and people outside the classroom working on it , but if it 's of no practical use to a school leadership team , then we wo n't see the impact . so , it's— . we 're in phase 2 at the moment , where we 're doing— . so , the initial resource has been developed by the oecd , middle tier and practitioners . we 're in the testing phase at the moment and having it evaluated itself , with a view to introducing that resource across the system at the start of the new academic year , in september 2020. i truly believe that , if we 're to make progress in welsh education , we have to develop the skills within our system to have robust self-evaluation . this resource gives us continuity of approach right the way across wales . so , it 's not left to an individual school to come up with a system ; it 's right the way across the system . my hope would be that those principles could then be applied to local education authorities , to regional school improvement services and welsh government as part of a whole-system approach to self-evaluation . i do n't know if there 's anything more you want to add , steve .",15,0.5,0.3524129390716553

0,0,"well , i think , first of all , it 's important that , whilst this additional resource is specifically targeted at school standards , that is only a part of a much wider education budget , a budget that—you know—is incredibly complex . and so it is really challenging to be able to draw straight lines—you know , 'we did this and it 's resulted in that'—given that we 're looking at the entirety of school funding here . what 's been really important is that , if you drill down into what that money has been spent on , 50 per cent of it has been directed towards professional learning in one form or another to support our teaching professionals . and that 's been really important to me . i 've said it time and time again : an education system can not exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in , day out to work with them and teach them . therefore , that investment in staff and investment in the professional learning of our staff and support for them i think is making a difference already but , importantly , will continue to make a difference . but i think it is really challenging to be able to say , 'well , we spent this bit of money and it definitely led to that ' , because it 's such a complex picture . but that money , the way it 's been spent , has been driven by evidence . and , again , what we do know from international best practice , what do we know that works in driving up standards , and then how can we align the money that we 've got to supporting that ? and , as i said , 50 per cent of that money has gone directly to simply supporting the professional learning of those who work with our children .",15,0.5,0.3521813750267029

0,0,"well , you 're right : what we have is a variety of ways in which we can identify schools that need support , or need to be challenged on their practice . but it 's important not to confuse them either . so , our primary route to doing this is our school categorisation system . sometimes , and perhaps this is inevitable— . that system is primarily there as a triage system around identifying where our resource should be spent . so , our school improvement service—it 's a risk-based approach , so they can evaluate where they need to put their time , effort and resource . sometimes , it 's used by other people for other things , but that is not its primary purpose ; its primary purpose there is not one of accountability , it is one of identifying risk and aligning that then to the support that is available . estyn—now that is part of that accountability system . that is our method of holding schools and their governing bodies to account for their practice and for the work that they do . both systems , of course , are evolving . so , how we do categorisation has changed over a period of time . the elements that go into making that judgment around the levels of support have changed , and , of course , the estyn inspection regime is also changing . at the moment , schools are only inspected once every seven years . we 're moving to a system where estyn will be more regularly in schools . so , they are two systems , but they are different and they look at different things . but our categorisation system is how we look for those ways of identifying support for schools .",15,0.5,0.36842820048332214
0,0,"and you 've made , with feedback over the last few years , adjustments to the way that the categorisation system works . are you content with where it is now , or do you see more adjustments being made ? have you got things in front of you that you 're getting feedback on saying 'well , we need to tweak this again a little bit ' ?",15,0.5,0.27115389704704285
0,0,"so , that system has evolved over time . so , when it started , it was just a tool around secondary schools . now , it covers the breadth of schools . initially , on coming into office , when i first came in , it was purely driven by data , and it was also done in quartiles . so , there was a certain number of schools that had to be in the bottom , which drove practitioners mad . they were like 'ah , every year , there 's going to be some of us that have to be in the bottom quartile ' , because of the way in which it was arranged , which seemed very unfair to them . so , we 've changed that . it 's not just purely driven on data now ; there are other judgments—the professional judgments of our challenge advisers are taken into account . and i would expect that situation to continue to evolve to align itself to our curriculum reform , and our changes in self-evaluation . so , it 's not a fixed point . i expect that that system will continue to evolve and change , so that it complements and assists in the reform journey as other parts of the system change .",15,0.5,0.2569611370563507
0,0,"thanks for that . i think , for any impartial reader of the way that the trends have been going on this , there is some good news within that , in that , certainly , those schools that might have been identified as have been okay but coasting along , seem to be moving up the categories , although we still do have that— . well , it 's what the system is there to do , it 's to identify those schools that do need that additional support . and i like your analogy of a triage system—'you 're fit ; keep on doing what you 're doing and do it well ; you need more support , we 'll put the support in . ' but , can i turn to those schools that are causing significant concern , and how we identify them ? the estyn chief inspector 's conclusions at the end of the 2017-18 report that these schools are not being identified early enough—there 's a need to do something urgently about these concerns , particularly in secondary schools . have we addressed that ? are you content that we 've addressed that concern ? was he right ?",15,0.5,0.39704763889312744
0,0,"no , the chief inspector is absolutely right—absolutely right . i 've got no beef with that statement at all . in some ways , when a school goes into special measures , in a way , that 's a failure of the system , because that should have been identified sooner . so i 've got no beef , as i said , with the chief inspector saying that .",15,0.5,0.2867220640182495
0,0,"so just to ask , bearing in mind the earlier discussion we were having , how is it that we do n't identify those schools ?",15,0.5,0.3235208988189697
0,0,"that 's it—you 're quite right . undoubtedly , what categorisation has done is led to a greater understanding , i think , on behalf of local education authorities ' and school improvement services ' knowledge about their schools . i think knowledge around schools is greatly enhanced by that process . but we are not there yet in terms of necessarily , then , moving those schools more quickly , once they 've been identified as needing the highest level of support to see improvement . and secondary schools is a particular , particular challenge . so you will have seen from the last publication of categorisation data that our primary sector continues to improve—more and more and more of our primary schools are in a green rating , which is very satisfying to me . but we have got more of an issue with secondary schools , and we have a particular issue with the same schools being identified in that level of categorisation . so even though we 've identified them as needing that extra help , they are not moving at pace away from that system . so there are two things that we are doing at the moment . the first is , we are , again , looking at different sets of data that can give us even earlier warning systems that things are going wrong in a school—and perhaps steve will explain later . for instance , staff sickness , and carefully monitoring staff sickness , because there is a direct correlation between high levels of staff sickness in a school and what is going on in the school . and steve can explain some of this work later . but we 're piloting a new approach to those schools that are causing concern . each local authority has been asked to identify two of their high schools that they are particularly worried about . and we have a new multi-agency approach , working with those schools to try and move them more forward . so it 's two from each region , a multi-agency panel , working with the school . and that multi-agency panel includes the school itself , the local authority , the regional consortia school improvement staff , estyn and welsh government—as a multi-agency panel to support improvement in that school . so , for instance , what would normally happen , estyn would come in , estyn would make a judgment on the school—requiring special measures or urgent improvement—and estyn would go away . they 'd go away for six months , and then they 'd come back in six months , and they 'd make another judgment , 'no , still not good enough ' , and disappear for six months . we 're saying—estyn and the welsh government have agreed that 's not the best approach ; estyn need to be part of the solution , rather than just coming and making a judgment . the initial feedback from this trial is very , very positive . actually , we 've had local authorities coming to us and saying , 'can we put more schools in ? rather than just having two of our high schools , can we engage more in this project and this pilot ? ' it 's being evaluated by cardiff metropolitan university and swansea university , so we 're having some academic overview to see , actually , does this approach work , can we evidence it—that it actually makes a difference ? and it 's actually—i 'd like to claim all the credit for it , but it 's actually not dissimilar to something that 's happening in scotland as well . but we knew that carrying on doing the same old thing clearly was n't moving these schools , we needed a new approach , and this is what we 're doing at the moment . so it 's relatively new , but the initial feedback is positive . steve , i do n't know—",15,0.5,0.4963533580303192
0,0,"i think your important point is about , 'what about the schools that are sliding in that direction ? ' and it 's bringing together what we know from estyn , but also , critically , local authorities have knowledge of their schools , and so do consortia . we 've got to be better at bringing those together . so , the minister gave the example of staff sickness—not always a trigger , but it 's one of those . if you look at movement of pupils out of a school , you can look at complaints , you can look at , actually , emerging increased use of hr resources that a school pulls on a local authority . none of these have been pushed up into the public domain , but they 're important antennae . the point the minister made about estyn as well is , historically , when they go into special measures , estyn , at the end of that week , call in , historically , either the region or the local authority , they will feed back to one of them , and then they go away . so , they are staying with it . so , we are brining together the knowledge . but , as the minister said , we want to keep a very clear distinction between the accountability and the transparency to the public , to parents , with the very detailed collective work of that multi-agency group to actually make that difference over time .",15,0.5,0.3156778812408447
0,0,"okay . so , does that— . i 'd love to go further , but time is against us . does that deal with the issue of the schools that have been identified in those categories of requiring significant improvement and requiring special measures ? are those the ones that will be identified now , or is that above and beyond that again ?",15,0.5,0.3241107165813446
0,0,"well , those are the ones that are primarily at the forefront of our minds , but this way of sharing data better , to step in earlier , is part of our attempt to address what the chief inspector says about stepping in early—not waiting until a school gets into special measures and a formal judgment from estyn of that , but actually using that intelligence to get support in there earlier . the three elements that that multi-agency approach look at are : what are the fundamentals that need addressing in this school ? what is the capacity of the school itself to be able to address those fundamentals ? and , what extra support needs to go into that senior management team and the governing body to get those fundamentals addressed ? and actually , what does sustainable improvement look like ? because , again , one of the issues , sometimes , that happens is , a school goes into a category with estyn , there 's a big push and a big , 'we must do something ' and the school comes out , but actually , that improvement is not sustainable . it 's the low-hanging fruit ; it 's the easy wins that have been achieved , but actually , perhaps some of the fundamental challenges underlying in that school have n't been addressed in that process . so , this is about what will sustainable improvement look like in six months , what 's it going to look like in 12 months and what 's it going to look like in 18 months . so , actually , a more strategic , longer term approach to real change in a school rather than , perhaps , some of the easy-to-fix items that make a school as if it 's doing better , but we really have n't tackled some of the underlying problems that make that school vulnerable to slipping back . does that make sense ?",15,0.5,0.27310407161712646

0,0,"i think you 're right . the variation across the country , across local authorities— . there are some local authorities that we 've worked with and we identify have taken the appropriate action . there are others that we 're working with , and yes , at its best , it 's done as a joint exercise where they use their regional school improvement service to help in the identification that there is a need for this . they take advice as to what the action is , whether it is , as the minister said , in the more significant areas , a board , or whether a warning notice comes in terms of standards or finance . so , we 're working with them and we 're working with the welsh local government association to share that practice . an example of that work is : we have done a development training session for cabinet members for education , and scrutiny leads for education across wales , and all 22 local authorities came to that and engaged with that . that was partly about self-improvement , but it was also about where significant issues arise , you have to constructively confront them . and that comes with what the region knows , and increasingly , we 're looking to have it consistently across 22 local authorities , so they are collecting all the additional data that we referred to earlier , so they can legitimately hold a mirror up and say , 'this is a real concern that we have . we 're not punishing you , but we 're registering the seriousness , and we want you to address it . ' and we 're making progress . i believe it 's genuinely more consistent now , but i 'd be lying if i said that there was consistency across all 22 local authorities .",15,0.5,0.3510280251502991

0,0,"because you are moving to a more sophisticated approach in terms of identifying problems sooner , and so can offer the support earlier , is it time to think about moving away from the system of categorisation entirely ? that is , has the categorisation system reached the end of its usefulness , and is the multi-agency approach , this more sophisticated approach , a better way , ultimately , of being able to assist schools in moving forward ?",15,0.5,0.3403262197971344
0,0,"i think , siân , as i said earlier , the categorisation system has evolved over time , and my expectation is that it will continue to evolve , because it has to be consistent with our overall approach to school improvement and raising standards . i expect oecd will have feedback for us on this important part of our system , and we 'll wait to see exactly what they say about it , but as i said in answer to huw irranca-davies earlier , i have n't got a closed mind ; we 've demonstrated over the last four years our willingness to change the system to make it a smarter system , and we will continue to keep that under review , as we move forward . if i could just go back briefly , it does n't sound like a very exciting thing , does it , when we say we 've been doing work with the wlga , with cabinet members , but also scrutiny , because that 's a really important part of the jigsaw as well , is actually local government scrutiny of the performance of your education portfolio holder and the leadership of your council . so this is about trying to up the ante on all sides , so that those issues around 'what are you doing in your local authority to use the powers that you have ?

0,0,"yes , briefly . i only have one final question . we 've talked a lot about early identification ; getting in there and then managing the improvement , this triage approach there , and then getting some grip of it , as well , in doing all of that . but my question now is on what we currently have . i wo n't touch on the primary schools , but let 's just look at secondary schools—11 per cent of secondary schools inspected in the last two academic years judged as unsatisfactory , needing urgent improvement . there will always be secondary schools and primary schools that hit moments of crisis for one reason or another , but 11 per cent to me , and to any layperson , would seem unreasonably high . are you— ? it would be daft to ask you if you 're content . what is a level that you would be content with of having schools in red category in wales ?",15,0.5,0.3570304811000824
0,0,"you 're right . schools will need different levels of support at different points , and sometimes , it 's not because of a crisis . so , for instance , in my region , we do have an increase in the number of schools in the amber category . that 's because we 've seen in that particular region a number of headteachers retire because they 've reached retirement age , and there are new headteachers . well , that is a moment of risk in the school—when senior leadership changes . nothing else has changed in that school , but the simple fact that you have a new leader , sometimes in those cases it might be their first headship . that means that that school is going to need a little bit of extra support , so it is n't always just a crisis that needs extra support , there are just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it . but you 're absolutely right—we have a particular challenge in the secondary sector where we have not been able to move individual schools forward at pace . and 11 per cent is not acceptable to me , huw , which is why we have introduced this new pilot to address those schools where , persistently , we have concerns about their ability to move forward . if we 'd have carried on doing the same thing , i suspect we would have just carried on getting the same result—hence the need for a new approach to those schools that are causing concern .",15,0.5,0.30464792251586914
0,0,"very briefly , the things we talked about earlier was how we measure the performance of schools , particularly at gcses , with a narrow focus . as was said earlier , some of these are the same groups—they trip in and then they do n't come out . our belief is , from research , that they concentrate on squeezing the pips to get the grades up in some small areas for a period of time , and you can do that by targeting and immersing them . estyn can tick the box to say your grades have got better , but we have n't handled the serious underpinning issues—leadership , teaching and learning , and bringing those together . as the minister said , what does sustainable improvement look like in six , 12 , 18 months ? it is n't just , as important as they are , getting those exam grades up a bit . they 're the fundamental— . and if they 're all agreed as the indicators at the outset , we 're more likely— . so it 's multi-agency ; it 's not a little activity , it 's a major strategy .",15,0.5,0.27832531929016113

0,1,"i call the meeting to order . welcome to the third meeting of the house of commons special committee on the covid-19 pandemic . pursuant to the order of reference of monday , april20 , the committee is meeting for the purposes of considering ministerial announcements , allowing members to present petitions , and questioning ministers of the crown , including the prime minister , in respect of the covid-19 pandemic . i understand there 's an agreement to observe a moment of silence in memory of the six members of the canadian armed forces who lost their lives last wednesday in a helicopter crash off the coast of greece . we 'll return to order . colleagues , we meet today to continue our discussion about how our country is dealing with the covid-19 pandemic . as we do , canadians , like everyone around the world , are doing their best to live their lives until things improve . meanwhile , as we look towards the future , i believe that it is also important to remember our past and to continue to mark the important moments in our shared history . at this very moment , the dominion carillonneur , dr. andrea mccrady , is performing a special recital to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the netherlands by the canadian forces . in may 1945 , canadian forces played a major role in liberating the dutch people from nazi occupation . may 5 is now a national holiday in the netherlands that commemorates the event and the great friendship that now exists between our two countries . today 's meeting is taking place by video conference . the proceedings will be made available via the house of commons website . please be aware that the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee . let me remind you that , as in the house or in committee , members may not take photographs of their colleagues or film the proceedings . in order to facilitate the work of our interpreters and ensure orderly meetings , i will outline a few rules . interpretation of this video conference will be done as it is at normal committee meetings and in the house . at the bottom of your screen , you can choose floor , english or french . as you have seen , i change as i am speaking . i have now switched over to english in order to speak english . if you look at the bottom , you have a little flag that indicates whether it 's english or french , and that 's how we will be speaking . it makes it easier . that was where we had a little bit of a glitch in the last session . i understand that there are no statements by ministers . we can now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes . i would like to remind members that petitions presented during a meeting of the special committee must already have been certified by the clerk of petitions . in addition , to ensure that the petition is considered to have been properly presented , the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for petitions certified in a previous parliament should be emailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. on the day before the committee . i thank all the members for their usual co-operation . thank you all . now we 'll proceed to presenting petitions . our first petition comes from the honourable member for sherwood parkfort saskatchewan , mr. genuis .",15,0.5,0.3611224293708801

0,0,"mr. chair , i 'm presenting a petition today that contains the concerns of canadians in my riding with the government 's approach to firearms legislation and regulation . the petition highlights that the liberal government 's december 5 , 2019 , speech from the throne contains numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation ; that the term military-style assault rifles is a political phrase undefined in canadian law ; that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions ; that the experts , including chiefs of police , agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety ; that the majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into canada from the united states ; and that the liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs , drug traffickers and illegal gun traffickers responsible for violence in our communities . the petitioners in missionmatsquifraser canyon are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners ; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed , rcmp-vetted canadians ; and to focus our limited resources on anti-gang enforcement , on reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs , on mental health and on providing the canada border services agency with the tools they need to do their job effectively .",15,0.5,0.38092803955078125

0,0,"thank you very much , chair , and bore da . i was going to ask some general questions about the value of the baccalaureate . could you give us your views on how the welsh bac is valued by learners and teachers ?",15,0.5,0.43629997968673706
0,0,"bore da , julie , and thank you very much for your question . firstly , i 'd like to begin by saying that i as the cabinet secretary value the qualification very much indeed . i believe that it helps ensure that we are able to give our young people in wales a broad and balanced curriculum , recognising the need to develop knowledge and skills in core subjects but recognising also that the purpose of education is to help prepare our children for further study and the world of work , and i believe that the skills challenge element of the baccalaureate does just that . i meet with young people and teachers all the time who tell me about the positive experiences they have had studying for the welsh bac , and much of that was evidenced in qualifications wales 's review into the welsh baccalaureate . they did focus group work with a representative sample , and many of the learners expressed the fact that they have enjoyed studying for the qualification and have gained a great deal from it . i meet regularly with individuals who have been able to use their bac to successfully gain a place at university , so i believe there 's a huge value for welsh young people being able to study this particular qualification alongside the more traditional qualifications that perhaps we 're all used to . i think the challenge is that , given that many people are very familiar with what a gcse is and , as parents , we will know what that is and many of us will have done—some of us are so old we 'll have done o-levels . we know what those traditional qualifications look like , and therefore a new qualification—there 's always a job of work to do to communicate that , if people are n't used to it , but i value it hugely . i think that , whilst there is always room for improvement—and , of course , you 'll be aware of the review that qualifications wales undertook and that has suggested ways in which we can further improve and refine the qualification , but i think it is a valuable piece of work for welsh young people to undertake .",15,0.5,0.36393144726753235
0,0,it 's great that you 've been around listening to learners and what they have said about it . have you had any negative feedback ?,15,0.5,0.4311734139919281
0,0,"well , occasionally , of course , we do have concerns raised with us , and those concerns are similar to the ones that have been raised in the qualifications wales review . so , for instance , we sometimes have concerns about how some students balance the welsh bac with other qualifications they may be taking . some teachers feed back around the workload issues associated with the welsh baccalaureate . for some students , there may be concerns about the nature of the welsh bac and whether that can impact negatively on their well-being . and , obviously , that 's why qualifications wales have undertaken this piece of work so that we can refine , if necessary , that qualification and how we continue to look at how we ensure my belief that taking the welsh bac should be the norm for students but also recognising that , in some cases , there needs to be flexibility to ensure that the well-being of the student is not compromised .",15,0.5,0.4570489227771759
0,0,and so would you say that it 's valued by learners more or less at key stage 4 or post 16 ?,15,0.5,0.3191526234149933
0,0,"well , i think that , as i said , the vast majority of students i meet report very positively about the opportunities that are afforded for studying at that level . occasionally , we hear from students who i believe think that in studying the subject they may be compromising their chances because they want to do additional a-levels , and i 'm sure we 'll come on to , later on , whether universities , and whether the russell group universities in particular , value the qualification . but i feel that there are particular strengths . and i think what 's really important , and , in talking to universities , since the qualification became graded , rather than just a pass/fail qualification—i think that added rigour since 2015 has been particularly important in ensuring that there 's real value in students undertaking that work .",15,0.5,0.3249187469482422

0,0,"as always , julie , leadership is crucial , and students ' experiences can be very coloured by the attitude towards the teacher delivering that particular course . and , therefore , we need to continue , alongside the wjec and qualifications wales , to ensure that the welsh bac is communicated to children in a positive way , the benefits are explained to children and their parents , and , also , we need to ensure that those who are tasked with teaching welsh bac in their schools or colleges feel confident in their ability to do so and to ensure that students have a really positive experience of that qualification , because if you 're being taught by someone who is telling you , 'oh , i do n't know why we 're having to do this ' , then , obviously that 's going to colour how you feel about it . and , if i 'm honest , i recently attended a youth forum , where young people from the county were discussing all sorts of issues—everything from the environment to their experience in school—and i was struck by the group of year 12 and year 13 students . i specifically asked them about the bac—i always take the opportunity to ask them about their experience of the baccalaureate . one school , the group of students said , 'it 's fantastic . we really enjoy it . it 's really valuable . i 'm learning a lot . ' students from a school seven miles away—just seven miles away—said , 'oh , i do n't know why we 're having to do this . ' and i suspect that that has got more to do with how that is being delivered in their institutions than it has about the quality of the qualification . so , we need to keep ensuring that those who are tasked with this see it as important , communicate that to students , and have the confidence and the ability to deliver a really positive experience .",15,0.5,0.34365296363830566

0,0,"well , first of all , we have the design group of qualifications wales looking to address some of the issues that arose out of the report around ensuring that , especially from a teacher workload perspective , it 's not too onerous in terms of assessment . so , there 's that to do to make sure that we 're not asking children to duplicate and do things over and over and over again , which , of course , for any of us , would be wearing and we would question to the value of . so , there 's the design group looking at the qualification itself . we are ensuring , as part of our professional learning for teachers that— . there are existing opportunities via the regional consortia for support for teaching of the qualification . the wjec has resources and support available , but we will look , as we roll out our national approach to professional learning , at that the professional learning needs of those already in the system are addressed . of course , our accreditation for our new initial teacher education is predominantly addressed at being able to deliver the new curriculum , but , if you think about the elements of 'successful futures ' and the skills and the knowledge and the pedagogy associated with that , it 's very much in line with the welsh baccalaureate challenge certificate . so , actually , there are opportunities via initial teacher education as well , and we continue to need to look to work with our partners to be able to reinforce why this is a worthwhile qualification . and i have to say i think the best people to do that— . it 's not me . i 'd like to see past students of the welsh baccalaureate being able to talk about their own experiences and why it 's made a difference to them . i come across individuals for whom their place at university has been secured by that welsh baccalaureate , and , all of a sudden , if that 's what 's got you your place , it becomes a lot more valuable than perhaps it was six months before . we need to make sure that students are aware , and teachers and school leaders are aware , of the importance that this qualification has .",15,0.5,0.39289548993110657

0,0,"yes . i 've got one on it , but i 'll leave that one . i just want to go back to julie 's question about whether there was a different perspective or a different sense of value for students who are post 16 and those who are pre 16. when one of the college leaders here was asked whether he had people coming to him in his fe college who 've been through the pre-16 bac and had heard evidence or had stories of , basically , those children cobbling together their bac in the last four weeks of term before they got there , he said that yes , that is his experience . does that worry you at all , because , of course , the whole purpose of bac is to teach skills over a period of time , and its purpose can not be fulfilled by getting it all done in the last term of—which year am i in ? —year 11 , in order to satisfy the curriculum ?",15,0.5,0.3938688039779663
0,0,"yes . obviously , that 's not the experience that we would want young people to have , and , as someone who has had a daughter just finish year 11 , that 's certainly not the experience that my daughter had in her particular school , and i have another daughter who has just gone into year 10 , where the welsh bac has started in year 10 and it is a a two-year course in which elements are undertaken . obviously , we will need to address , as part of the design group and the work that qualifications wales is doing , how that is playing out in individual schools . but that would not be a positive experience ; we want this to be taken in exactly the same way as we would expect a gcse to be taught over a period of two years . but , andrew , i do n't know if there 's anything you 'd like to add from the college perspective .",15,0.5,0.2773258686065674

0,0,"i think the variability can be perhaps explained by the fact that it 's a new type of qualification , the fact that different schools have adopted it at different rates—",15,0.5,0.4168386161327362
0,0,ten years ?,15,0.5,0.4529849886894226
0,0,"well , as i said , over that time , there were some early adopters who have done it in a certain way , there are some people who 've come later to it , who may be doing it in a different way . and , as i said , it 's quite a different departure from traditional o-levels , from gcse-type subjects , where there is a programme of work and a syllabus . so , it is a different nature of qualification , and , therefore , as andrew has just alluded to , schools have approached it in a different way . we are alert to that and qualifications wales , crucially , is alert to that , and we are looking to ensure greater consistency in how it is delivered in individual schools . we 're also aware , in the school setting , in pre 16 , there are some concerns about the onerousness of the workload associated with the evaluation of the students ' work . now , clearly , there is a difference between onerous and rigorous . we wrote the qualification to be a rigorous qualification for the students , but we do n't want it to be jeopardised by the evaluation of it being too onerous . so , there 's that balance to be struck . again , that 's one of the issues that the design group and qualifications wales are looking at . that process is a really important process , so there is the design group , but working alongside the design group , who they are testing the messages and testing their thoughts with , is a stakeholder group , and there is also a practitioners group . so , that work by the design group is being tested with those people who have an interest : business , for instance , the world of work—is this qualification really giving students the skills that are valued by potential employers ? —but it 's also testing its thinking with the practitioners , those people who will be charged with the delivery of the qualification , and i think that 's really important to be able to get an understanding of the challenges of making sure there 's a consistency , and what are the barriers to that , and what steps need to be taken to ensure a greater level of consistency in delivery .",15,0.5,0.290751188993454
0,0,"is there a correlation between consistency in general ? because we know that there 's polarisation in the secondary school sector between the good schools and the not-so-good schools . and is there a correlation between—if the schools are good according to estyn , or excellent , are they also good , excellent at delivering the bac ? is it a fundamental inconsistency across the sector that 's causing this inconsistency ?",15,0.5,0.3770270347595215
0,0,"i do n't know . i do n't have that data to hand , but , of course , from next year , the bac will be a dedicated performance measure for schools . so , actually , we will be looking specifically at completion of the bac as part of the wider set of school performance measures . so perhaps we will be in a better position once that 's formally established to be able to track progress .",15,0.5,0.3435550034046173
0,0,"because some of the evidence we 've heard is that if the leadership is good around the bac in the school , well , everything else follows from that . so , it makes sense to me that it could be .",15,0.5,0.32796719670295715
0,0,"absolutely . as i said , i do n't have the figures to hand , but , as i said , from next year , the bac actually becomes a formal part of the performance measures for schools .",15,0.5,0.41426944732666016
0,0,"fine . i 'll turn , therefore , to the understanding of employers of the welsh bac and the skills challenge certificate . from the evidence that we 've had , it appears that there is a problem in this area , that is , employers generally do n't value the qualification . is that your experience , and how can we improve that ? how can we elicit more engagement from employers of all sizes with the value of the baccalaureate ?",15,0.5,0.34166911244392395
0,0,"well , the first thing to say is my understanding of the development of the bac is that employers ' voices were reflected and they were part of the process that drew up the qualification in the first place . you 'll be aware of the review by qualifications wales that found that many employers say that the skills that are developed through the baccalaureate are exactly the kinds of skills that they want young people to be acquiring whilst at school , that put them in a good place for looking for employment later . i would agree with you , siân , and not just in terms of the bac , there are lots of reasons why we need greater working between education and employers . i sit down with employer organisations to try and explore better ways in which we can work together—everything from ensuring that children have work experience opportunities through to , for instance , what more some of our companies could do to take up governors ' roles , for instance , in our local schools , so that employer voice and that business voice are heard at a school management level . i think these things are really important . it 's something that 's sometimes difficult . there are some excellent examples of really good practice where local employers work really closely with schools . i think of sony in bridgend doing a really , really , really good job working with their local schools . in other areas , where you have n't got such a big employer , it can be difficult , ca n't it , for a small business that is trying to do their small business to think about , 'oh my goodness , i 've got to do something to help improve the education system as well . ' so , i 'm always looking at new ways in which we can get that working together . as i said , the qualifications wales design group has a stakeholder group that is helping them with their review into the qualification at the moment , but there are really good examples where employers and other organisations are working together . we also need to continue , i think , to communicate more clearly with employers the nature of the qualification . again , because it 's relatively new , and the brands of the gcse and a-level are so strong , people know what they are , unless you 've either done the welsh bac yourself or you have a son or a daughter , or a grandson or granddaughter who has gone through the process , you 're probably going to be less familiar , and we need to continue to work together with the wjec and qualifications wales as a government to better communicate the value of the qualification .",15,0.5,0.38732510805130005
0,0,"so , you agree that there is a specific piece of work that needs to be done around employers and that the government should be leading that .",15,0.5,0.2958920896053314
0,0,"yes , and we are working closely with , as i said , qualifications wales to develop a joint communication plan , and we continue , as i said , as part of qualifications wales 's review into the nature of the qualification—employers ' voices are being heard as part of that particular piece of work . but more generally , yes , i think there 's more that we can do to better engage employers with the education system in lots and lots of different ways .",15,0.5,0.3794529139995575

0,0,"just before we move off this section , the variability that the committee has seen has been quite pronounced , really . we 've been to a school where they 've got a passionate and dedicated welsh bac school leader , but then we 've spoken to other schools where it 's tagged on to a variety of teachers ' roles , and that clearly has an impact on the way it 's being taught . you said in your answer to siân that you 're trying to ensure more consistency in the delivery of it , and you referred to the performance measures ; are the performance measures the main vehicle by which you 're going to ensure consistency , or are you planning to issue any more guidance to schools on how it should be delivered on the ground ?",15,0.5,0.3852366507053375
0,0,"we will need to reflect the work that qualifications wales is undertaking . professional learning , i think , has a role to play as well as performance measures . so it 's not just one thing that we can do that will change this , it is a number of things—everything from the communications plan to making sure that teachers who find themselves responsible for delivering this feel confident and have had the professional learning opportunities to give them the skills so that they do a great job in delivering a positive experience to students . the performance measures , of course , as we know—sometimes in schools , it is those that make schools focus on something . so there 's a wide variety of ways in which i think we can look to ensure more consistency . but , in the end , i think it is professional learning and teacher training , ite , that will make the biggest difference .",15,0.5,0.4864577651023865

0,0,"well , it 's an absolute— . it 's one of the things that i have been very clear to the regional consortia that i expect their challenge and support advisers to be asking schools about . so , one of the conversations that they need to have when they are in schools is exploring , with that school , how they are using their pdg , and how they 're demonstrating an impact for those resources . so , it 's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work . it 's crucial .",15,0.5,0.36659032106399536
0,0,"that sort of brings to mind some of the research that 's been done on the role of the challenge advisers , cabinet secretary , which suggested that they 're not actually challenging schools in that way , and that there 's very little evidence of schools changing their decisions on the use of pdg as a result of any challenge from those challenge advisers . so , how would you respond to those findings ?",15,0.5,0.3435736298561096
0,0,"well , as i said , in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia , i specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of pdg within their particular region . i think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource , and i think that is being fed back into us . estyn tell us that it 's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base . but , clearly , there is more to do , and that 's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for pdg going forward , because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level .",15,0.5,0.3905605375766754
0,0,"okay . so , you would recognise the findings from that research .",15,0.5,0.48583728075027466
0,0,"yes . there 's always more that we can do , and we are strengthening that role by the appointment of the new regional pdg advisers , so that individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for , know what they should be doing , and there is a regional approach to good practice .",15,0.5,0.33474794030189514

0,0,"i think it 's fair to say that , on occasion , i have received feedback that there was a conflict between what was going on at an individual school under the school improvement programme and whether , then , they welcomed support from the regional consortia as part of that . so , in some cases , if we 're being absolutely honest , there could sometimes be tensions between the two , but in most cases , the relationship was very , very positive and there was continuous feedback between the work going on in the schools under the programme and the regional consortia challenge advisers . but i 'm going to be blunt and honest with people—in some cases , it has been reported to me—it 's only anecdotal evidence ; i have n't got hard and fast evidence—that there sometimes was a conflict : 'we 're a school challenge school so we do n't need to participate or listen to any advice that 's coming from the regional consortia . ' or , a local education authority said to me , 'we felt that we could n't get involved in that school anymore because it was part of a different programme .

0,0,"mr. chair , i have four petitions to present today . the first petition reflects the outrage of my constituents at the ever-expanding order in council from the government banning more and more firearms . in particular , the petitioners highlight the failure of the government to act on the issue of illegal guns . the petitioners note that virtually all violent crimes committed in canada , including the recent shooting in nova scotia , involve illegal firearms in the hands of those who are already not permitted to possess them . the petition has two asks . first of all , it asks that we reverse the order in council banning certain firearms , but also that we propose measures that will effectively address the illegal use of firearms by criminals while respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens . it also asks that we ensure that substantial changes to firearms laws in future actually be made by parliament , not by the government acting in an unaccountable manner . the second petition deals with bill c-8 , which is the government 's bill around conversion therapy . the petitioners support efforts to ban conversion therapy . they express concern about problems in the wording of the definition used in the legislation . they 're asking the government to support amendments to fix the definition to address the issue of conversion therapy and ensure that the definition is correct and does n't criminalize certain forms of counselling that individuals may voluntarily enter into . the third petition is regarding bill s-204 , a bill in the senate that seeks to make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad to receive an organ without consent , dealing especially with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking in china . the petitioners are supportive of bill s-204 and want to see it move forward . the final petition is with respect to bill c-7 . there 's been much discussion in this house about the need to do better in terms of long-term care . rather than working to do better in long-term care , unfortunately we 've seen the government removing vital safeguards in the area of euthanasia . i think our focus should be on assisting life rather than removing safeguards that are required in association with the euthanasia regime . the petitioners are particularly concerned about the government 's plan to remove a 10-day reflection period that normally takes place . that period can already be waived under certain circumstances , but bill c-7 proposes to remove it entirely as well as reduce the number of witnesses involved . the petitioners are quite concerned about what 's going on in bill c-7 and call for it to be stopped or amended .",15,0.5,0.2672710716724396

0,0,"in your report , the 'alignment of the childcare offer for wales to the foundation phase ' , one of the recommendations was that 'the welsh government , local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge ' . so , looking behind the scenes , those disparate parts of policy , delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge . is that the case ? has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth ?",15,0.5,0.3275138735771179
1,0,"well , probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you 're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points , which we have taken on board . for example , we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase , which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we 're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme . i think it 's about £81 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities , because that was one of the things that came out from this report you 're referring to . and , i mean , obviously , early years is one of the key priorities within 'prosperity for all ' and , obviously , education sits within one portfolio with the minister for education , and childcare is with me . but we 're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together , and that was one of the proposals in that report . but it 's still very early to think about , at this stage , a structural change .",15,0.5,0.5452682375907898
0,0,"and i remember when you were on the committee here with me , sitting next to me , we had those discussions about co-location . i know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day . are you suggesting now that the actions you 're taking will resolve that issue universally , or will it lead to a piecemeal resolution ? and , if so , to what extent , what percentage of children will see that resolved as an issue ?",15,0.5,0.3128103017807007
0,0,"certainly , the co-location is not going to solve it universally because although we 've been able to develop a lot of new facilities , or build on old facilities , there will be a lot of areas that we wo n't have covered . so , i ca n't say that there 's going to be a situation where everything is going to be co-located because i do n't think that would be feasible , and , for some of the providers , they would n't be in a position to move to a school . but ideally it 's a good situation , but , certainly , i think the discussions that there were on the committee , it 's not ideal to take children for long distances between different providers , let alone the effect it has on the climate change issue . it 's whether it 's good for children as well . so , i ca n't say that they will ever be co-located , but as i said in response to your earlier question , we are encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings , which , obviously , is quite significant .",15,0.5,0.2699331045150757

1,0,"right . well , thank you very much for that question . i mean , obviously , it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency , but i think it 's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation . now , early education , of course , is the responsibility of the minister for education , and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education . for example , local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across wales , but there 's quite a variance in how much is actually provided , with some local authorities providing a lot more historically . so , it does mean that there is a different pattern across wales , according to what local authorities do . but what i could say is , of course , the quality is very good , as the estyn reports have shown ; that the quality provided , the delivery of the foundation phase , is very good . but it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout wales , and that is the decision of the local authorities , and it is a historical thing . i refer to this pilot in flint , which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare . we 're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon , in november this year , so that will help us . obviously , i think local authorities ' role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local , nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas . and then , of course , we 've got flying start , which is geographically targeted , which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered . and that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households . so , again , that determines the pattern throughout wales . with flying start being geographically targeted , with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is , we know that there is a variance throughout wales . we 'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas .",15,0.5,0.5083194971084595

1,0,"i have n't seen any evidence . obviously , i must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the minister for education , but i have n't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered , and the reports from estyn are very good . in fact , i think the foundation phase is one of our great joys , that we absolutely celebrate it , and so i 'd be very concerned if i thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase , and i certainly have n't had any evidence of that . i would want to guard against that .",15,0.5,0.5042774081230164

0,0,"going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of wales , the welsh and uk governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market , with subsidies mainly given to working parents . is that a mistake ? should it be more universally available ?",15,0.5,0.2661682665348053
0,0,"well , some of our provision is universally available in certain areas . for example , the flying start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas , and i think that 's very important , because that does mean that there is n't stigma , and so , in those areas , everybody can take advantage of it , and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it 's reaching those areas . so , i think that there is a purpose behind that . in terms of when you say demand led , could you elaborate on that ?",15,0.5,0.4477013051509857

1,0,"no , i have not been given a date . what i have done today is publish the principles that will aid me in , as you said , me making a decision . so , clearly , we will be relying on the advice of our medical and scientific advisers , but the principles are very clear . firstly , we will need to consider any decision to have more children returning to school in the context of the safety and the physical and the emotional well-being of children and young people and the staff . obviously , i ca n't make a decision regarding education in isolation . it will have to be taken in the context of the wider welsh government response to dealing with this pandemic . thirdly , it is absolutely crucial in making any decisions that we have clearly communicated that to parents and to staff , on the information that we have used to reach any decisions , to build confidence for parents and professionals , but also to give them time to plan . it will be impossible to move quickly to new ways of working . and we also have to look at—and it 's been paraphrased quite a lot today—if we are looking at certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting , which groups they should be . and , finally , how do we operationalise that ? how do we make those settings as safe as they possibly can be , and how do we tackle some of the difficult challenges of everything from ensuring that we have adequate numbers of workforce available , to the very real questions about how you would do social distancing in the context of education , school transport issues , how you would avoid people gathering at the school gate , for instance ? so , there are very practical issues that would need to be considered and thought through very , very carefully before we could return , before what we could see is a move from where we are now to the next phase of education , and new approaches to what schooling may look like . but , again , i must be absolutely clear to you , members of the committee , and to people watching : it is not feasible , in this sense , that we would move from where we are now to what all of us would regard as normal education and what the operation of schools looked like before the start of this pandemic .",15,0.5,0.517964780330658
0,0,"so , what is clear from what you 've said is that it 's going to be phased return . i would assume that would be the most vulnerable—perhaps additional learning needs pupils would return first . just reading some of the things that you 've said today , can you answer that question ? and can i also ask : you said that guiding principle no . 3 will be having the confidence of parents , staff and students , based on evidence and information , so they can plan ahead . what will that evidence and information be , and how will you know that you 've got the confidence of parents to return ?",15,0.5,0.2825344502925873
0,0,"well , as i said , primarily , we will need to take a lead from our scientific and medical advisers . i want to also say that we are obviously working on a four-nation basis and keeping in very close contact with my counterparts in northern ireland , scotland and england . but we 're also looking beyond the united kingdom to approaches to education in the face of this pandemic . members are aware that we as a nation are a member of the atlantic rim collaboratory . so , recently i was able to talk to educationalists and ministers in iceland , other parts of europe , north america , south america and australia . so , we 're also looking at best international evidence in this regard . and , clearly , we will need to be very clear , as today is an attempt to be very clear with parents and our teaching professionals , and the unions that represent them , about the basis of that evidence .",15,0.5,0.2525998055934906

0,0,"okay . i 'll move on to my question to kirsty williams . now , it is clear that any decisions that need to be taken on reopening schools would have to be made in the context of all of the other issues that the welsh government has to take into account . and it is entirely clear that the approach of government towards testing has n't been sufficiently developed for us to even start to think about removing restrictions . so , would n't it be dangerous , if truth be told , to start to discuss reopening schools when we have n't had the necessary testing in place for the majority of the population ? and does n't it convey a mixed message that we 're starting to relax some of these restrictions when , in reality , the restrictions are still in place and still need to be in place robustly ?",15,0.5,0.4822257459163666
0,0,"first of all , thank you very much , siân , for that important question . can i be absolutely clear , and i thought i had been pretty clear in answering hefin david , that we are not relaxing any of the restrictions with regard to education ? as i said to hefin , it is not imminent that we would see a further phase in the next stage of education here in wales . what i have done today is to provide clarity on the nature of the principles that i would use when coming to any discussion . it is the responsibility of me , as the minister , and indeed of the wider government , to begin to think about planning for the future . but i have been absolutely clear : we are not moving to an imminent change in how education is operating at the moment . and i 'm also very , very clear that should we be given the opportunity to see more children in our schools , i will only do that when it is safe for me to do so , when i 've been advised by the cmo that i am able to do that , and we have given sufficient time and planning to the sector to respond . it is not going to be easy , and we will need to give them , as a sector , time to be able to address . but if i have not been clear enough , let me say it again : we are not relaxing any issues around schools at present , nor is that imminent .",15,0.5,0.40612170100212097

1,0,"thank you , suzy . as i said in my statement earlier today , returning to school will not be a return to normal , and in recognition of this , i 've already made it clear that i will seek , in all opportunities , to reduce the burdens on school . that includes various data collection , the suspension of performance measures and removing the requirement to undertake literacy and numeracy testing , and , clearly , school attendance will want to be an important factor of that .",15,0.5,0.5131370425224304

0,0,"thank you once again for that . the smooth operation of the hubs , with regard to health and safety , is , of course , of paramount importance . what we have seen since schools closed for traditional statutory purposes and moving to their repurposed function—we have seen a change of pattern over time . so , following my announcement on , i believe , 18 march , the week after , we saw a large number of settings open and operating . as local authorities have been able to understand the demand for those places—from critical workers and vulnerable children—we have seen more local authorities move to a hub model , and we have been able to publish guidance to local authorities on how issues around safe working in those hubs should be followed , and we 've been able to give guidance in that regard . local authorities are asked by us to report any incidents where they are concerned about operation issues on the ground .",15,0.5,0.3925895392894745

0,0,"thank you , chair . just following on from your answer to siân gwenllian earlier about the number of vulnerable children in school , what 's being done specifically to facilitate more of those children coming into a school setting or hub at the moment ? i 'm thinking about the 600 you 've talked about , and i know , in one of my local authority areas of merthyr , which is a very small authority , we 're talking about the number of children identified as vulnerable running into thousands , not hundreds , and that 's just in one authority . so , this is a particularly difficult issue to address , i appreciate , but how are we going to get more of these children into the hubs ?",15,0.5,0.4593358635902405
0,0,"okay , dawn . the first thing to say is that the issue of vulnerable children attending settings is one that is a challenge to not just wales , but also to my colleagues in northern ireland , scotland and england . i 'm pleased to say that we are working across government departments—myself , obviously , and colleagues in education—with colleagues in social services to have a cross-government approach to these issues . i think the first thing to say is that these are complex messages , because the overriding public health message from our government has been to stay at home and children should be kept at home as much as possible , and to make sure that our hubs run smoothly , safely and effectively , we do need to limit the number of children who are attending those hubs . so , firstly , the fact that numbers are small is in some ways a success of our public health messages , because parents have been heeding those messages , but , of course , all of us will have concerns for some children who remain at home . so , i 'm pleased to say that we have seen a doubling in the last week of the number of children . so , although numbers are small , they have doubled over the course of the last week . we 're working with local authorities and they have assured us that children and young people with a social worker have been risk assessed on a multi-agency basis and are receiving support in a number of ways , and that includes having conversations about some of those children attending the hubs . they 're also looking to support in other ways . of course , some of our children who would be classed as vulnerable—and our definition of 'vulnerable ' is one that is shared between the systems in england and wales—could be children with a statement of special educational needs . for some of those children who , perhaps , have very intense health needs , actually , staying at home is the appropriate thing for that child and that family to do , and we 're looking to support families , and local authorities and local education systems are looking to support families , in a number of ways . we also know that just because you do n't have a social worker or a statement of special educational needs does not mean that a child may not be vulnerable , and schools are very aware of the needs of those children and have been carrying out regular telephone check-ins where they can—if the age of the child is appropriate—just to keep in touch with those families and those individual children . but we will continue to work across government to encourage , where it is appropriate , children to attend settings , and , if it is not appropriate for children to be in a setting , that there is contact with those children and young people to ensure that they remain , and their families remain , supported .",15,0.5,0.25444576144218445
0,0,"thank you , minister . it 's encouraging to hear you talk about the ongoing safeguarding of children that are at home and i assume , within that , appropriate referral mechanisms are still in place if teachers or anybody has any particular concern about a child . similarly , with special educational needs , whereas some of those children benefit clearly from a one-to-one provision in a school , and they may not respond as well to remote working , or remote contact , with an sen advisor , are you considering in any way any relaxation of the lockdown rule in particular for those children in terms of them being able to access the support that they need for their particular educational needs ?",15,0.5,0.3606683015823364
0,0,"well , first of all , dawn , you 're absolutely right : my expectation is that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children , and schools should continue to refer children to children 's services if they have any concerns , and that would also , of course , be the case for youth workers who may be keeping in contact with children . so , there is a professional expectation on all those that are working with our children and young people that , despite the circumstances they find themselves in , they should continue to report and refer cases if they see anything or hear or are told anything that makes them concerned about a child 's welfare and safety . with regard to children with additional learning needs , i am aware that that can present a number of challenges to families and children , and perhaps steve davies could give some further details . we have been keen to work with local authorities to ensure specialist provision , where that is appropriate—so , if i could give you an example of my own local authority in powys , they have two specialist centres available for children with more profound additional learning needs , and those centres are available—recognising , however , that , even with the provision of specialist hubs , it can be a challenge for some children with additional learning needs to find themselves outside of a routine . hubs are often staffed on a rota basis and therefore children could be faced with staff that they are unfamiliar with . so , even when local authorities—and the vast , vast majority of them do—have specialist services in place , sometimes that might not be the best thing for a child 's health and well-being . but perhaps steve can give us further details of the conversations that have been taking place with directors of education to ensure that children with additional learning needs have access to the hubs and specialist support . steve .",15,0.5,0.32659032940864563

0,0,"you 're right , dawn : we have to consider how we can support children not only in their learning during this time , but also to recognise the very real impact that the pandemic will have on all of our mental health and well-being—recognising , of course , it is absolutely natural for all of us , including children and young people , to have fears and anxieties at this time . that 's a natural reaction to the situation that we find ourselves in . but , of course , there are issues around those children that would have currently been receiving school counselling , and also being able to be in a position to respond to a potential growth in the number of children that are receiving support . so , the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families . in the immediacy , of course , that will have to be done in different ways than perhaps we 've traditionally delivered services in the past , because of social distancing and lockdown rules , but we want to get some of these systems in place now , rather than waiting for everything to go back to normal . we need to be able to plan to offer services in the here and now , but also be able to plan for what potentially could be an increase in the demand of those services . so , we 've been in close touch with local authorities , asking them what they believe that they will need and how they can use additional financial resources , and we 've been very pleased to be able to secure that for them .",15,0.5,0.2731221914291382

0,0,"yes , absolutely . so , that would include remote counselling as in a fashion that we 're doing now , but also , as and when some of the restrictions are perhaps removed , looking at an enhanced family therapy , or a therapy approach . so , when we talk about counselling , i think it 's important to recognise that there will be some flexibility around this money and it does not necessarily mean that local authorities have to use it on a one-to-one basis . that might not be appropriate for some children , especially our younger children and their families , and they can use that money to provide counselling or therapy—in the widest possible terms—that is the best method to support individual children and their families . but , clearly , we 're having to do that in the confines of lockdown and social distancing at the moment . some of that money can also be used to support the professional learning and the professional development of counsellors , because , of course , they may be being asked to work in a different way and we need to make sure that they have the appropriate skills and abilities to do that .",15,0.5,0.22652430832386017

0,0,"so , we have a close working relationship with the national union of students . i meet with them regularly , and officials are in constant touch with the student voice . they have been very clear , and i think there is a huge amount of consensus between the welsh government , what the universities are asking for and what the students are asking for . you 'll have seen , only earlier this week , the very powerful campaign by nus wales about the importance of erasmus+ arrangements . there is a huge amount to be gained for welsh students and young people participating in the erasmus programme . many of us , i know , have had the opportunity to study abroad as part of our own studies , and there 's a lot to be gained from it . we 've been very clear from the outset , as have the sector and the student voice , about the importance of participation in that scheme . nus are also very concerned that there should be no negative impact on the quality of faculty . our he institutions , to a greater extent than fe , have faculty staff from the eu—it runs at about 11 per cent . that adds great diversity and strength to the quality of teaching within our institutions . clearly , that is a concern for students . they want to have the best teachers , they want access to the best learning opportunities , and we 've been very clear about the importance of providing security and stability for those staff , making sure we send very clear messages that they 're very welcome and we value their contribution . nus , again , also value the diversity in the student population . again , as far as we 've been able to , we 've been able to give messages about the security of funding for european students for the next academic year . i wish i could go further , but that 's out of my hands . we 're working to the limits of what i feel comfortable in being able to guarantee without further guarantees from westminster . so , we 've been working closely with the student voice , and i think , llyr , what 's very clear is there is a consensus about what is important across the government , the institutions and student voice . so , that is making sure we send very clear messages about wales 's institutions being open for business and that we welcome both eu and international students , that we value the contribution of faculty , and that we want to be able to continue in horizon 2020. that 's especially important if we 're looking at attracting postgraduate work and postgraduate students into our system , as well as erasmus+ . the issue of post-study work visas , again , is very important . as i said , there 's a consensus , i think , between the government , the institutions and the students about what we need the uk government to achieve for us .",15,0.5,0.4270061254501343

0,0,"well , i think it 's really difficult for us to prepare for a 'no deal ' brexit , but obviously we need to think through very carefully what that might look like , and i think that scenario planning is starting to happen . i think it 's very different , again , for fe compared to he . so , in relation to fe , what we do have is funding—esf funding—which the uk government has said that they will underwrite until 2020. so , in march next year , if there is no deal , the immediate impact on fe is unlikely to hit in the way that we may have feared . the problem then becomes : what exactly is the deal with the eu in future , because we will have some kind of relationship , and what that impact will be on the broader economy and our ability to work with companies locally , and industries , to provide that link between training needs ? so , the colleges , basically , are providing the training for lots of the apprenticeships , and so if the number of companies reduces , then that is likely to have an impact . so , there are specific sectors that we are more concerned about than others . farming is obviously one that we are concerned about , because that could have a difference in terms of day one of no deal . if your markets are not there , that could be quite an immediate impact . health and social care—obviously , we are concerned that there are a number of people who work in that sector who are eu citizens . what is the impact ? are they going to feel unwelcome ? are they likely , then , to return home ? where will that skills gap , therefore , be ? so , that 's a problem for us . construction is already an issue for us in terms of skills shortages . so , one of the things we 're doing is we 've developed these regional skills partnerships where we ask local employers , 'what is it that you need in terms of skills development ? ' and we are now asking further education colleges to respond to that need . so , rather than them just getting people through the college system , who are easy to get in because they 're doing courses that they 're excited about , let 's try and encourage them to do courses where we know there are skills shortages . so , that is a new structure that we 've developed that is already having an impact ; there 's a £10 million project there . so , we 're already putting things in place for those situations . in manufacturing , obviously , if there 's no deal , the rules of origin , that could have an immediate impact . just-in-time—we could have real problems in terms of dislocation there ; and hospitality and tourism . so , those are the sectors we have most concerns about , and all of them have very strong links to the fe sector .",15,0.5,0.4738677740097046

0,0,"yes , they 're absolutely central to that planning . we know , again , that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families . therefore , the same situation that we 've just described for maintained schools also applies to special schools . we 'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings . in some cases , that may not be possible . so , again , already local authorities are making different provision . can i give a shout out to the work of rhondda cynon taf in this regard , who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools . but , again , steve can give more detail .",15,0.5,0.29702848196029663

0,0,"okay . and my final question is in relation to the position of early years and childcare settings . i know that kind of crosses over into somebody else 's portfolio as well , but i think we know that . certainly what i 've seen , and i 'm sure this is true elsewhere as well , we 've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries . i 've got one in particular , there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there , and the parents are taking them out . they 've got 30 staff there , catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation , at this stage , is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages . is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage ?",15,0.5,0.3903355598449707

0,0,"yes , it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken , but i have done so on the very , very clear and unambiguous advice from qualifications wales . i met with qualifications wales and the wjec yesterday . what was most important to them was that i made an early decision and i did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams . i was able to make an informal decision at that meeting , and then , of course , there is a formal process that we have to go through . that , now , allows qualifications wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision , and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work . we are trying , as far as we can , as i understand it , to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day , for instance . it might not be possible , because , of course , we 're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it , and those human beings could find themselves unwell . so , our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in august , but that has to be caveated by the fact that we 're dealing with difficult circumstances . but , the wjec and qualifications wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next .",15,0.5,0.37155741453170776

0,0,"okay , so , all exams are cancelled , but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade—i think that 's a distinction that people need to be aware of . that is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications , and they are points of movement in the education system . so , it 's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next , whether that be university , whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form , into a college , into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities . that 's why we have to focus on those children , because for them , it is absolutely critical that we do . we are at an advantage in wales , can i say ? because of the nature of our examination system , those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on . because we 've kept our as-levels , we have got that data . because we have a gcse system— . our year 11s , if they 're doing triple science , they 've already done 40 per cent of their paper , so we 're very fortunate . because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system , there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use , alongside , potentially , teacher evaluation of students as well . and i think that 's really important . we ’ re starting from a better base than simply having none of that externally-verified data . what will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications , and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within wales , and i know that qualifications wales are discussing with their counterparts across the uk a modulated system across the uk . so , actually , we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the uk . so , we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade . so , they can have real confidence .",15,0.5,0.43211647868156433

0,0,"yes , that is correct . so , our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure—which i think , if we 're honest , we have to acknowledge is what we 're looking at—we would expect school staff—well-being staff , for instance in school—to be doing check-ins—phone check-ins , potentially , or facetime check-ins , with students , just to keep in touch with them as we go forward . we 'll be looking to promote amongst young people a range of online facilities that are available—so , for instance , meic website—so , looking to use a variety of platforms . we do , of course , have the formal nhs counselling services . i 'm concerned , of course , that for some children their access to their counsellor is via their school . we know that , and we 're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists—online counselling tools that children already use because they do n't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor . they 're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue , as far as possible , those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered , and their worries . i think we have to remember that this is a really worrying time for children and young people . one of the reasons , again , that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible—and teachers have been working so hard to do that—is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we 've needed and wanted to maintain . children will have worries about their own health ; they 'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents ; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves . so , we need to understand , and i think we will also have to recognise , that this support will have to be ongoing once we 're back to normal , and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience . they are incredibly resilient , and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages . they are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands ' and things like that than even adults have been . so , they are incredibly resilient , but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them .",15,0.5,0.2840496897697449

0,0,"thank you very much for that question , chair . i 've got to say 'yes ' , in many regards . so , the key focus of the programme in the early stages was about improving access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services . we developed the windscreen model—or we lifted the windscreen model . other models that are very similar have been talked about as well , and our big focus was on ensuring that we could make immediate progress around access to specialist camhs . it 's some years ago now since this committee did the original report , and obviously healthcare inspectorate wales and the wales audit office had done reports in the past , and i think there was a need for a programme that could focus on action . you 'll see in the written update that we covered quite a large number of areas , and so therefore had to make a prioritisation . the prioritisation was at the specialist camhs end . we have provided the committee with a red , amber or green rating of where we feel that we were , and that was just before submission of the evidence . overall i would say we have made progress . i recognise you recognise that in your 'mind over matter ' report , and that is pleasing . what i would say , though , is that there 's a still a lot to be done . certainly over the last nine months or so , we 've seen a real momentum around the whole-school approach work , which we 're not actually leading now as a programme , although we facilitated the workshop held in september . but that 's got a real momentum , and the absolute priority now is the early help and enhanced support part of the work moving forward , and i 'm sure we will come on to that in more detail . but we know there is more community workforce in specialist camhs , we know we 're seeing children in a shorter time frame , and we know we 're accepting more referrals , so our indicators are telling us we are making progress .",15,0.5,0.454091340303421

0,0,"this is maybe about what the programme 's done , but really around the broader sense as well . i 'm going to be very straight and say we should have made more progress on psychological therapies . i 'm disappointed that we have n't . i 'm assured that we 've got capacity in place now and the drive in place to get the matrics cymru framework developed for children and young people . i 've had discussions with the national psychological therapies committee , who have owned this , and we 're working together more on this area . that 's not to say for one minute that health boards and local areas have n't been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models , but that is an area we should have made , i think , earlier progress on . there 's been a general reflection from myself and the together for children and young people programme board over the phase of the programme . i think we started very strongly ; i think we probably had a bit of a lull in the middle , if i 'm truthful about that—we had a change of personnel , and we really gathered a momentum over the last year or 18 months , and that has helped to push us from a focus on specialist camhs into that whole-school approach . but , if i could just agree with your comments about the whole system , it has to be the whole system and that 's why the real focus now on early help and enhanced support is critical . if i can just say , in case i do n't get a chance to say this later , i was delighted to see the focus on youth work yesterday , because what is clear is for that part , the early help and enhanced support , this is n't just about the nhs and it 's not just about education , it 's about every part of the system , really , which does make it more complex . but i just wanted to say that i think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it 's needed and yesterday was a positive step .",15,0.5,0.4450322091579437

0,0,"thank you . good morning . in terms of local primary mental health support services , what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the mental health ( wales ) measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people , and how much of this is due to an increase in demand ?",15,0.5,0.31148096919059753
0,0,"yes , thanks very much . so , it 's important to say , i think , at the outset , just by way of reminder , that the target , quite rightly , changed for children and young people . the target changed some years ago for adults , so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children . so , the services were working , a couple of years ago , with significant demand and then a change in the standard . i think you 're absolutely right ; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children , particularly within the 28 days . i would say— . and we 've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce , the staff , who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health , into a bit more of the secondary element , which is why the review being undertaken by the nhs delivery unit into primary care camhs is so critical , because , actually , if we do n't have—and i believe we do n't have—enough capacity in that part of the system , then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this . so , i think we will have seen , by the evidence submission , that demand has increased , not just in wales but in the uk , and it has increased significantly . we are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand—so , we have more contacts , more staff , shorter access times , so that is a good news story . we 've not got it completely sustained at this stage , and therefore the focus of the delivery unit 's primary care camhs report is what more can we do in that part of the system to help to see children and young people or provide consultation and liaison to others and support people at that level of intervention .",15,0.5,0.3347983658313751
0,0,"thank you . i know , from my own experience as a constituency am , i have families who tell me that they ca n't get into the early interventions and eventually things just become so—they end up in the more specialist ones and believe that that's— . and i do n't like to put it in resource terms , but it 's false economy in terms of the impact on the child and the family , but , obviously , in terms of cost as well . do you find that that 's a common theme across wales ?",15,0.5,0.37492457032203674
0,0,"yes . i think that the thrust of that is absolutely right . so , we absolutely need to see children and families at the earliest intervention and that 's why this is a whole system , not compartmentalised . i think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help—hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist camhs , but can be supported , often by telephone , at that earlier stage . my sense of where we go next , in terms of , you know , you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle ' , as you referred to it in your report , is to make sure we 've got a fully joined-up , multi-agency team approach to that . and i think that will need some resourcing to support that , yet to be fully determined . but yesterday 's announcement about youth work , the government 's commitment to primary care , camhs , et cetera—that 's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist camhs . and just a final note on that , if i may—at the beginning of the programme , we had a report from hafal called 'making sense ' and there were 10 key asks , if you like , of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service . they said , 'please do n't medicalise it'—i 'm paraphrasing now , of course—'please do n't medicalise it ; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then , when we really need help , please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level .

' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme . i 'm pretty secure on the specialist camhs element . that will move , most likely , to the camhs network , which is part of the nhs mental health network . i actually chair the mental health network and that 's one part of that . the whole-school approach element is already settled in government and we 've got a connection in to that . the question that 's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go . i am currently in discussions with welsh government officials around that . i can be very clear of my own view that there needs to be a confident and clear legacy arrangement for this work . we can not afford that we 've come so far for this not now to proceed . i think there 's a huge momentum behind this . i do n't see there would be any obstacles—i hope—in getting that commitment translated into a strong approach , as we move forward . so , i 'm not in a position to say , 'and the legacy arrangements will be— ' , but i am in a position to say that i 'm having those discussions with welsh government officials . they know my view that we 've got to put something in place that is strong and secure as we move forward , and i believe that they are supportive of that .",15,0.5,0.36850661039352417

0,0,"thanks very much for that . without wanting to go back too far in history , i remember coming into this area back in 2014 as i was asked to establish a camhs network . my observation was there was n't really a strong and well-connected clinical community in this area . when we spin forward five years , i can confidently say that there is a strong and well-connected clinical community around specialist camhs . the programme has helped ; the emphasis and the focus of the programme has helped to bring people together with that more common endeavour to understand , actually , there is a good case for consistency in the main , with local variation . there has been a case for much greater learning between organisations . if i just give you an example—you 'll know that the community intensive service teams were put in place in 2015-ish . some areas have them , but a lot of areas did n't . we do have inconsistency in that , but the consistent part is there is a service now right the way across wales for more intensive support to children and young people and their families in their own homes , which helps to prevent admissions and then , where there are admissions , helps to support people to be at home . they 're all called slightly different things . so , i might have referred in my papers to citt , catt , cot and cite . so , they 've all got slightly different names and they 've got slightly different opening hours . the key thrust of this is that there is a backbone , if you like , of a consistent approach with that local variation . we have to check . so , things like frameworks for improvement—there is a coming together of the clinicians and the professionals to agree what that framework for improvement is . that then gets implemented , with some local variation . so , i think the process of moving in that way has been extremely helpful . there will be some variation . we want some variation , to some extent , as places try new things and evaluate new things . so , if i just refer to the previous question that i had , and i talked about hot clinics and different ways of reaching out ; that 's been tried in one area , been evaluated—let 's see the spread of that . so , you 'll know my view on internet counselling , for example ; i feel that is quite a strong offer for children—not necessarily in the specialist end . if that works in one area , why are n't we rolling that out to other areas ? so , i think the framework for improvement has provided a vehicle for those clinicians and professionals to come together . it 's in a stronger place—a much stronger place—than it was five years ago .",15,0.5,0.3933523893356323

0,0,"obviously , what you 'll all be aware of is that , as part of the consultation for this bill , the public policy institute did a further piece of research to look at the impact of physical punishment on children . a number of things that we know—we know from across the world that the evidence is that introducing legislation or changing legislation in this way improves children 's positions within their families . what we know is that children themselves , as alastair has already referred to , really find physical punishment demeaning and harmful , and for children it is an emotionally damaging experience . now , there may be disagreement about that , there will be different views on that , but that 's the voice of the child in this debate . the voice of the child is very clear that physical punishment is for them harmful . i think what we would also say is that , in the world that we work in , it 's part of a continuum , and , whilst this is an element of how children are cared for , what we see is a continuum where an acceptance of how we treat children in a particular way perpetuates throughout our work . by changing this , it helps that shift to that absolute recognition that our children must be cared for in a way that is physically safe in all dimensions for them .",15,0.5,0.39535990357398987
0,0,"okay , thank you . we 've had evidence from the equal protection network that the reasonable punishment defence undermines child protection and fails to protect children because it permits an arbitrary level of violence , which invades children 's physical integrity , making it a potential pathway to more serious physical or sexual abuse , and you did refer to that just now . is there anything you want to add on that ?",15,0.5,0.3433433175086975
0,0,"i would echo that . i think there is something in this that is about our culture , about how we see our children . it is about how we see our smallest and most vulnerable people , and if it is acceptable it opens the door to those other , more extreme versions of violence , which then complicates the issue for us . this is about clarity , and , whilst there is an argument that this is a small episode for a child , it 's not a small episode for a child , it is a major episode for a child , and i think absolutely , as you said , the potential for it then to lead on , and over gradation and time to increase the risk for children , is clearly there .",15,0.5,0.319870263338089

0,0,"on the reasons for the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in wales , which are higher than those in england , and also the numbers of contacts that we have across the local authorities , the work of the care crisis review , which was completed last year ; the work of isabelle trowler , who 's the chief social worker in england ; countless research and reports that have taken place in the last 18 months ; and currently the public law working group , under the auspices of the president of the family court , would all indicate that it 's multifactorial . so , what you have is a range of reasons that have led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across england and wales . what you ca n't do is identify a single reason . there have been headlines that have said , 'is it increased austerity ? ' that is clearly a part of this . is it in wales an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of , for example , domestic abuse ? is it because of our understanding of what happens to children in those households ? all of that research would say it 's all of those things . and then , when you also add in changes in our practice with our colleagues in the judiciary , changes in our police service , but also changes in our preventative services , you 've got that whole range of elements . and there is going on across the local authorities and welsh government a huge amount of work to try to address and understand that , and then to ameliorate that . children who need to be in care for safety need to be in care , but what we have to do is get to a point where fewer children come into care and we 're able to protect them , firstly , and secondly where those children who are in care are cared for in a way that delivers the best possible outcomes for them . so , there is no simple answer unfortunately . i think , in terms of this bill and unintended consequences , i agree absolutely with everything that huw has said . my job is around children at that far end , but what this bill does is it brings clarity . it brings a clarity even for those children at that very far end . it takes away even that point of discussion that this could possibly be okay , and i think that 's important to hang on to .",15,0.5,0.23673945665359497

0,0,"well , i think you 'll be aware from the range of programmes that we 've got that we do feel it ’ s important to support both children and parents . there 's obviously lots of evidence to show how important the early years are for children , how important they are for their development , and so , that is one of our primary objectives . but we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs , reasonably paid , so that can also help with the development of the children . so , we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children , and we believe that a high-quality , early-childhood education and care system can provide that . and , of course , in terms of when we talk about jobs as well , i think it ’ s really important to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer . so that , actually , itself provides jobs .",15,0.5,0.28185421228408813

1,0,"well , probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you 're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points , which we have taken on board . for example , we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase , which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we 're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme . i think it 's about £81 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities , because that was one of the things that came out from this report you 're referring to . and , i mean , obviously , early years is one of the key priorities within 'prosperity for all ' and , obviously , education sits within one portfolio with the minister for education , and childcare is with me . but we 're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together , and that was one of the proposals in that report . but it 's still very early to think about , at this stage , a structural change .",15,0.5,0.5453007817268372

0,0,"thank you , chair , and good morning . i just want to start by asking about your perception of how schools are using the pupil development grant funding , and to what extent they are genuinely targeting that funding exclusively towards children eligible for free school meals .",15,0.5,0.4792727828025818
0,0,"thank you for the question . this grant has been targeted far better by now than it was originally . estyn has made several reports regarding the effectiveness of the grant , and , really , going back to before this specific grant , to a similar grant , called raise . at the start of this grant , the funding was often spent on tackling underachievement , rather than dealing with the underachievement of children who are eligible for free school meals specifically . but , over a period of time , we have seen that it is targeted much better by now . that 's not to say that the targeting is working perfectly still , and i think that we are seeing examples where the targeting is n't going just to children who receive free school meals . schools sometimes interpret poverty in a slightly wider way than that . in terms of what schools are doing with the grant , we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things that they are doing . they are tracking progress of pupils , they are trying to improve attendance , they are trying to work with families and the community in general , they 're doing work specifically to improve how children are doing in exams , in key stage 4 , specifically—a lot of funding is being spent on that—improving the confidence of students , taking students on extra-curricular activities , improving literacy and numeracy . those are the kinds of activities they 're being used for .",15,0.5,0.35898488759994507
0,0,"because the research by ipsos mori and the wales institute of social and economic research , data and methods has shown that there is some kind of blurring—i think that 's the term that they use—in terms of who is eligible . but you are relatively comfortable with the fact that there is sufficient targeting happening . you referred to the fact that it is used , perhaps , to reach a slightly wider cohort than just those who are eligible for free school meals , but you do feel that that balance , from your experience , is acceptable .",15,0.5,0.29217812418937683
1,0,"yes , certainly , it has improved a great deal . when i was looking at this initially , the targeting wasn ’ t happening at all . it was being spent on children who were underachieving , and one of the things that we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was being spent on boys than girls . and , of course , that raised the question immediately that it was n't being spent then on children who are eligible for free school meals , because those numbers are equal . so , it wasn ’ t , but it has improved . there is a discussion about who exactly should have it and whether free school meals is the best definition . so , i think that schools are perhaps not following that exactly , but within the spirit of the grant , i think i ’ m fairly comfortable . there is a specific question—i don ’ t know if you are going to ask this—regarding more able and talented pupils .",15,0.5,0.5209853649139404
0,0,that 's where i was going next .,15,0.5,0.3506110906600952
0,0,"so , if there is a cohort of pupils who are missing out on this , they are the more able and talented pupils who receive free school meals . there are a number of reasons for this , i think . one of them is that there ’ s still some feeling that less able children should be receiving this grant , children who are underachieving . schools don ’ t always identify underachievement of those more able children . it seems that they are doing okay , but if they were given more support , they would do even better .",15,0.5,0.3552107512950897
0,0,"so , is it a lack of awareness of the nature of the grant , and that the individual has to be targeted rather than just those who are underachieving ? is that the problem ? or is it the regime that focuses on exam results and the need to draw those pupils who are underachieving up , rather than incentivising those who are achieving to achieve better ?",15,0.5,0.30131995677948
0,0,"a bit of both , i 'd say . and the third factor is identifying children who are more able . i think that we have a bit of work to do in that regard . i was in a conference for headteachers last week , where there was new data being discussed , and that data showed the progress of children from a certain point , year 6 tests . i think that kind of data will be very useful , because what that data can do is help secondary schools to identify more able children and that they are underachieving . even though they 're doing quite well , that kind of value-added data is very useful . so , i think that that will help as well .",15,0.5,0.3148791491985321

0,0,"well , i think estyn has always been very strongly focused on improving the performance of more able pupils . for example , in last year 's annual report i raised it , and a lot of the debate around this now , i think , was generated by some of the things i 've said in previous annual reports . we gave a lot of evidence to the— . paul flynn , i think , did the—no , who did the report ? paul murphy did the report . so , we gave evidence to that . and on seren , i 'm particularly proud that my alma mater , jesus college , is a very strong supporter of the seren work . so , i 'm personally quite interested in the work of seren . and we look at the performance of more able pupils in all our inspections . it 's a particular part of our inspection framework—looking at the relative performance of different groups . so , we look at the different performance of boys and girls , free school meals and non-free school meals , ethnic minorities , but we also look at the performance of more able pupils in particular , and we question schools about how they provide for the more able pupils , and we 've referred to seren in several of our inspection reports .",15,0.5,0.3710503876209259

0,0,"it certainly is a good way of doing it . there is a strong correlation between children who underachieve and that measure , so it is a strong measure . but , there is scope to discuss how exactly it does work . for example , some people say that if you have received free school meals for a period of time and now you 're not receiving them , then perhaps you should still be receiving the funding for a period of time , for example . so , there are ways of fine-tuning that measure , i think . it 's worth considering those approaches .",15,0.5,0.29907169938087463

0,0,"i think that sort of proportion broadly corresponds to the schools that do n't have particularly good leadership . i think , ultimately , all of these sorts of initiatives come down to strong leadership and effective leadership—that they know how to organise and use those grants effectively . one of the shortcomings that we often identify is evaluation—that money has been spent on a particular way of using the grant , but it has not been evaluated well . so , i think quite a lot of it is to do with generic leadership skills . but those are some of the specific shortcomings to do with evaluation .",15,0.5,0.3879460394382477

0,0,"yes . i think this is sort of generally accepted now . the latest guidance on the grant now says that 60 per cent of it should be spent on key stage 3. i think that acknowledges this general point . but what a lot of schools did with this money was precisely that , to target key stage 4—to have catch-up homework clubs , revision clubs , specifically to get children better gcse results , and getting c grades , in particular . of course , that is an important part of your armoury of tools to use , but i think there was too much use of that . part of the problem with that is that it does n't either develop the long-term transferable skills that those pupils have , or should have , nor does it produce the kinds of skills that the teachers need as well . so , it 's kind of a quick win , a quick-fix solution , while what we feel would be more effective in the long term , and more sustainable in the long term—because if this money goes , then those quick fixes wo n't be possible—what would be more effective in the long term is to improve the curriculum and the pedagogy , the quality of the teaching , the quality of the curriculum , so that children are naturally enthused by what is on offer , that they attend better because they want to be in school , that they want to learn . so , we feel that getting the curriculum right , tailoring the curriculum to the needs of the pupils in that area , and improving teaching , is a more sustainable long-term solution .",15,0.5,0.38905811309814453

0,0,"i think that , of all the areas of school policy , this is the one that 's most evidence-based . i think that , generally , schools can do much more about using evidence and research findings , but this particular area is probably the one that schools are strongest at using research in . that 's partly because the guidance strongly suggests that you should do that , but also because there is a lot of easily accessible research evidence available . so , there 's a lot of research on this . as i mentioned earlier , the sutton trust toolkit is a good example where researchers have really tried very hard to simplify all the evidence that exists in a way that schools can use . so , there are little pound signs to show how costly an intervention is and little stars or something to show how many months of gain pupils get out of this particular intervention . so , it makes it much easier for schools to make a decision . but i think what 's missing is that you ca n't just take that evidence as it is , because you have to implement it in your own school , and that then will affect how effective that particular intervention is . just because it is evaluated by researchers as being generally very effective does n't mean that you will necessarily implement it effectively . so , it is therefore important that each school does evaluate . so , there are kind of two sides to using research . there 's looking at research , but there 's also doing your own research and evaluating how effectively you have implemented something . i think that 's been a weakness .",15,0.5,0.4499977231025696

0,0,"well , i 'm in danger of repeating myself now . it 's quite difficult to identify the cause and the effect in terms of the pdg . so , where there have been improvements , it 's quite difficult to say , 'well , that 's definitely down to the pdg ' , and similarly vice versa : if it 's not working , it 's difficult to say that it 's because of pdg not being used properly . to come back to something else i said previously , there have been small improvements . whether you say that that is due to pdg or not is quite difficult , but there have been some improvements . but there has n't been a major step change in closing that gap , that is true , and i think the conclusion that i draw is that these are major societal challenges and barriers that these young people face . schools can do a certain amount , and of course they must do a certain amount , but to have a step change you do need to engage with the learners , with the parents and with the community and that 's why the more successful schools do actually succeed—it 's because they do that . so , i think more of a push on that area at a national level would be welcome .",15,0.5,0.323331356048584

0,0,"yes , they definitely had a direct impact on it , and probably there might well be an indirect , longer-term impact as well . but , clearly , changing the performance indicators had a direct , immediate effect , because some of those examinations , qualifications , courses that were typically followed by this cohort of students were n't any longer part of the headline performance indicators . so , you 've all heard about btec science and the key skills qualifications . those sorts of things that many of these pupils used to succeed at , and therefore get the performance indicator for the school , no longer count . so , it 's had a direct impact , and it 's one of the reasons why it 's quite difficult to compare the results of one year and another , because of these changes in performance indicators .",15,0.5,0.3201349973678589

0,0,"i think there 's a growing realisation that secondary schools , key stage 4 , is driven overly by performance indicators , and , whatever performance indicator you come up with , there will be unintended consequences . so , it 's not , i think , useful to keep changing the performance indicators and think that you will get to a point where you solve the problem . that 's not likely to happen . what needs to be done is to have a different approach to accountability that does n't put so much attention on these performance indicators , because what you 're doing is you 're just moving the problem around by changing the performance indicators . some of these vocational courses that i mentioned are a good example of this . so , i think the previous performance indicators encouraged schools to enter , for example , whole cohorts to do btec science , and that 's not a good idea because the gcse sciences are better preparation to go on to a-level science , for example . so , you 're cutting out the possibility of progression for those pupils . on the other hand , by discouraging—the new performance indicators discourage btec and now people are saying , 'we 're not offering btec at all ' , and it is suitable for a certain cohort of pupils . so , it 's very difficult to get the performance indicators absolutely right if you put so much pressure on schools to actually achieve those performance indicators .",15,0.5,0.3627358078956604

0,0,"bore da . i just want to start by asking some questions around the targeting of the pupil development grant because , clearly , we 've had a lot of evidence around this apparent blurring of eligibility to an extent . i 'm just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because , clearly , it 's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals , from some of the evidence we 've had , but also that it seems to be predominantly focused on low-attaining frees—pupils who are eligible for free school meals .",15,0.5,0.48905149102211
0,0,"thank you , llyr . i think it 's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions , those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals . but in some cases , schools may use their pdg funding to provide a universal intervention , but we would want to—in challenge advisers ' discussions in schools—we 'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals . so , for instance , if i give you an example in your own region , llyr : at brynteg county primary school in wrexham , if you look at that primary school in wrexham , their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts . so , there is no differentiation in those results . one of the things that they 've used their pdg for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school . so , that 's a universal thing that they 've trained all the teachers in , but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals . so , if you 're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset , it 's about really challenging learners to think that , ' i can do things . if sometimes i fail , i pick myself up , i 'm more resilient . ' now , that has been , as i said , trained to all the teachers in the school—it 's an ethos for the whole school—but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater , and now they 're at the same level . so , that 's the important distinction . individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals , but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff , for instance , and that , then , has to demonstrate it has a disproportionate effect on free school meals . so , growth mindset ; it may be attachment disorder training for staff , for instance , where we know it 's of benefit to everybody , but will have particular benefits for that cohort of students . with regard to more able and talented , you know , llyr , that this is an area of concern for me , generally , within the welsh education system ; that we 've not been particularly good at identifying , supporting and driving attainment for those children . i 'm absolutely clear that pdg needs to be used for those children who are eligible to drive potential , whatever the potential of that child is , including more able and talented . and again , i 'll give you an example that has been seen as good practice in pembrokeshire : a window on the world bus , again paid for by schools . i do n't know if you 're aware of it .",15,0.5,0.45705270767211914

0,0,"well , to flip it on its head , the vast majority of schools , as identified by estyn , are using this money to good effect . so , that 's the way i like to see it—that the vast majority of schools are doing well . what estyn has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools , and as you 'll be aware , leadership , improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission . of course , that 's being developed in a different work stream . i think what 's fair to say is that the use of pdg is evolving over time . i think we are seeing , increasingly , more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students . so , if we 're honest , when pdg first started , i think , in some schools it was spent on investing in tracking of children , because they 'd never thought about tracking these children , they did n't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children , and to have a system in place . so we 've moved now from spending money on the infrastructure around support for fsm children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning . we 're also seeing from estyn that , actually , in terms of money following the evidence of what we know works , estyn says that pdg is probably the best example of schools following tried and tested and evidence-based interventions to deploy the money . but clearly we want all of this money to be deployed as well as it can be , and again we come back to the decision i 've made to appoint regional pdg advisers so that we can get that better consistency of approach . we are , in the discussions that i have with the regional consortia about how they challenge individual schools on usage , looking for very clear evidence of schools using the sutton trust toolkit , and we could have a discussion about whether that 's the right thing , because that 's on my mind too . but we want to see schools demonstrating their evidence base , and if they 're not , if a school is n't doing that , okay , so demonstrate to us why you 've made those decisions and , crucially , what are you doing as the school to judge whether that decision is actually making a difference for your individual pupils . so , if you 're moving away from tried and tested interventions , what we know works , if you 're doing something different with your money , okay , you need to justify that and you need to explain how you 're going to demonstrate impact . but i think what we 're seeing is increasing good practice in this area as the pdg develops and as our understanding of our school-to-school working in our self-improving school system also develops . i think we 're seeing better usage of the money year on year .",15,0.5,0.378720760345459

0,0,"no , i do n't think it 's being driven by cuts to core funding . i think there has been— . one of the biggest impacts of pdg has not been—well , i suppose it is the money in itself , because the money has concentrated the minds , has n't it ? so , one of the most important things that pdg has done is highlight the importance of this agenda within schools , and really raise this up in the thinking of leadership and senior management teams in our schools , and has driven a focus on scrutiny and accountability in the systems that are working with our schools . i think the changing use of pdg reflects the journeys that schools have been on , some of them from a very low base where this was not a priority for them , to better understanding , and as research and as intelligence grows over time in this area , both in wales and outside of wales , schools are increasingly learning to use that evidence to tailor approaches in their schools .",15,0.5,0.35496842861175537

0,0,"i think what 's important to note is that , as estyn have themselves said , over the period of the last inspection report , we have seen improvements in attendance , but i do think we need to , again , look at how pdg can support this particular agenda . and as always in the welsh education system , there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this . ysgol y preseli in pembrokeshire is a very good example of how they 've deployed their money . forgive me ; i ca n't off the top of my head remember the name of the primary school i visited , again in north wales , where the school has proactively used this money , and they actually send teaching assistants out of school in the morning before the start of the school day , and they actually have a walking bus . they call at homes for children , and they walk the children to the breakfast club . so , they 're proactively going out into the community and making sure that those children are in the classrooms , because the teacher said , 'we recognised we had a problem with attendance . we tried a variety of means of improving that , but in the end we have taken this quite bold step—we actually send the staff out and they create that walking bus , and they walk the children into school ' . they say that they know that , for some of those children , because of the difficult circumstances they and their families are living in , they probably would n't be in school if it was n't for that proactive approach . so , we 're looking again at what more we can do to support this particular agenda in terms of improving attendance , because although , again , there are examples of good practice , there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils . and , of course , we can have the best curriculum in the world with really high-quality teaching , but unless the children are in the classes then we 're not going to make the difference for them . whilst that differential exists , then it 's going to be hard to close the attainment gap for those children .",15,0.5,0.39961355924606323

0,0,"i think my questions are first , but , michelle , please do correct me if you were planning to come in before . the pdg for looked-after children does n't quite seem to have the degree of visibility as the pdg for the free-school-meals . i think we had the mori/wiserd survey—only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary schools were aware that pdg was targeted at looked-after children . i just wonder—can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with pdg for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia in this field ?",15,0.5,0.3525069057941437
0,0,"okay . i think it is absolutely fair to say that most awareness around pdg is around free school meals . there is less awareness around the availability of pdg to support looked-after children . i think that 's probably in the nature of the cohort , so , there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after . so , i think that 's part of the explanation . a decision was taken in 2015 to regionalise pdg for looked-after children . my understanding was that the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it was being used previously . so , looked-after pdg is held at a regional level . we have looked-after children pdg co-ordinators—they 're in their second year this year—to look at a regional deployment of that resource . and that resource can be done in a variety of ways , through individual allocation to a school to support an individual child , through to capacity building for the whole system . so , for instance , if i give you an example , in carmarthenshire , there 's been a big emphasis on attachment disorder and training teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder . carmarthenshire happens to be one of those local authorities that does quite well in terms of attainment for looked-after children . but , clearly , i have—not concerns . 'concerns ' is n't the right word . but i have asked officials to give greater scrutiny to how that resource has been used in the last year . steve , on my behalf , wrote out to the system , setting out our expectations , but also advising them of the fact we will be asking very detailed questions of accountability for that money . so , what has that money been used on and how can you account for the effect ? but , steve , maybe you can give some greater detail .",15,0.5,0.3247784674167633
0,0,"i think the challenge that— . one of the rationales for shifting—not that all the money stays in the region , but having a regional strategic support—was that , historically , the money was going directly with that child to the school . given the quite often rapid turnover of children in schools—the very nature of looked-after children is they do sometimes move through foster parents—historically , what happened , the money lands in the school , because , at that time in the year , when it 's measured , the school gets the money and can spend it on some additional support for staff , but quite often that child moves on to another school and the money does n't transfer . some schools will go through quite a number of years without having a looked-after child and will not think strategically , 'how do i need to support them ? ' so , that was the rationale of the shift . in terms of the implementation of the regional allocation , as of this financial year finishing , we are going into local authorities and regions to evaluate where they 've located the resource , what the impact of that resource has been , so that is reinforced and shared more widely .",15,0.5,0.3653849959373474

' , but then there 's also a tension about how can you create some flexibility around the school 's usage of the grant . so , we will look at that . i think there is the issue of where a school would know of a child that was looked after . issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive , because we could n't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child . so , a family may be very open and very keen to explain that to a school , but we ca n't necessarily track as closely children who have been adopted , especially if that adoption happens before the child goes to school . we ca n't be in a position of forcing families to disclose this information if they do n't want to , but we certainly can , as i say , look to strengthen our monitoring arrangements around pdg support for looked-after children and the impact that that 's having . i just think we need to be a bit mindful of people 's privacy in some instances . if they do n't want to divulge that , it would n't be my job to tell a family , 'you have to let us know if your child is adopted .

0,0,"yes . can i follow up on tracking adopted children ? i entirely understand that you ca n't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted . however , my understanding was that , in england , there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that i 'm not clear is happening in wales and how , if at all , that links to the pupil level annual school census data . perhaps sort of linked to that , is n't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools , potentially , with adopted children more aware that adopted children who were previously looked after have this potential grant , and would they not be more willing to disclose this , at least confidentially to the school and government , if they knew there was this upside of doing so ?",15,0.5,0.4065926969051361
0,0,"we 're actively looking at whether we should try and find a way of collecting this data , with the caveats that i just gave earlier . we ca n't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them , nor would i want to . but there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether we could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through . you 're absolutely right . one of the ways in which we can often encourage take-up , for instance , of free school meals , especially in those communities where there is a sense of reluctance to apply for support—even though people are entitled to it , there 's a reluctance to do it ; sometimes we see this in rural areas— . actually , appealing to the parents by saying , 'actually , this will mean more money for your child 's school budget' is a much more compelling reason why people will apply for it then saying , 'actually , it 's going to help you ' , because they do n't want to be seen being dependent , they do n't want to be seen being helped . but , if you say to them , 'actually , do you know that this means more money for your child 's school ? ' , they go , 'oh , all right then , i 'll fill in the forms now . ' so , you 're right , i think there is something that we could do to make parents understand , in the round , that this has an impact . but we are actively looking at and discussing whether we could create a dataset around adopted children and how we can do that in line with data protection and data sharing . one of the things i am concerned about in the performance of looked-after children generally is how we can , across government , work more closely together . we ca n't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education . it 's got to be a job of social services and the health service as well . there 's got to be a joined-up approach to doing that . now , officials were at the ministerial advisory group that 's chaired by david melding on prospects for looked-after children . they were there at the group last week . david tells me that the paper was very positively received by the group . i will be sitting down with david melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side . i think there 's really an appetite between me and the minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this . we ca n't expect schools to do it on their own and alone . and there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes . it 's not just about the pdg ; it is about , when social services are thinking about a placement , where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school—when does that take place ? do we talk about the placement , move a child and then think , 'oh my goodness me , what are we going to do about the schooling ? ' if you can imagine , the school could have been working really , really hard with a pupil to get them in a good place , to get them being able to access the curriculum , and then social services decide that the placement is being changed . so , we potentially lose all of that . so , a greater involvement in education and better linked-up working in local authorities will help us with this . it ca n't be just the job of the pdg . if we think we can crack this with just pdg , then we 're being delusional . it has to be a cross-government approach at a national level , and at a local government level as well , to get this right . sometimes , data protection—how can we break down some of these barriers between , you know , the school does n't need to , schools should n't see , the entire social services report ? well , maybe the school does need to see some of that background information if they 're going to have an impact for that child . so , there 's more work to do , but it can not be just the job of education on its own if we 're going to make a difference , nor can it just be the job of the pdg to make a difference for those children .",15,0.5,0.3023029565811157

0,0,"well , there 's no getting away from it : the way in which we currently measure outcomes for looked-after children , the results are not good enough . it 's a source of huge concern to me that we need to do better for those children . that 's why officials are engaging with the group that david melding is chairing , to make sure that education is integral to that group and it 's not lost sight of . there 's a discussion to be had about the cohort , whether it 's right and correct to compare looked-after children to the main cohort , or whether these statistics are useful in any way . sometimes as well—this is not to make an excuse because , as i 've said in my paper , it 's extremely disappointing , but sometimes it can be really difficult . because the cohort sometimes can be very , very small , it can swing the statistics to look perhaps more dramatic .",15,0.5,0.43326520919799805

0,0,"we can look at exclusions . we also have to read across about how the whole system works , not just the pdg element of the system . so , we know , for example , that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need , so we ca n't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding ; we have to look at it at a wider level of support . so , given that the majority of those children will have an aln , how can we make sure that our new aln legislation and our new aln regime meets the needs of these children ? so , i think what we 're looking at , again , is to say that it ca n't be just the job of the pdg . that 's there as an additional level of support , but actually , we 've got to get our aln right . unless we get our aln right , lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in , day out via that system . we do know that sometimes , if we 're not addressing aln , then we 're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance . so , we 've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting , that are not just as a result of the fact that they 're looked after ; they have other needs as well .",15,0.5,0.2846669554710388

0,0,"this is maybe about what the programme 's done , but really around the broader sense as well . i 'm going to be very straight and say we should have made more progress on psychological therapies . i 'm disappointed that we have n't . i 'm assured that we 've got capacity in place now and the drive in place to get the matrics cymru framework developed for children and young people . i 've had discussions with the national psychological therapies committee , who have owned this , and we 're working together more on this area . that 's not to say for one minute that health boards and local areas have n't been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models , but that is an area we should have made , i think , earlier progress on . there 's been a general reflection from myself and the together for children and young people programme board over the phase of the programme . i think we started very strongly ; i think we probably had a bit of a lull in the middle , if i 'm truthful about that—we had a change of personnel , and we really gathered a momentum over the last year or 18 months , and that has helped to push us from a focus on specialist camhs into that whole-school approach . but , if i could just agree with your comments about the whole system , it has to be the whole system and that 's why the real focus now on early help and enhanced support is critical . if i can just say , in case i do n't get a chance to say this later , i was delighted to see the focus on youth work yesterday , because what is clear is for that part , the early help and enhanced support , this is n't just about the nhs and it 's not just about education , it 's about every part of the system , really , which does make it more complex . but i just wanted to say that i think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it 's needed and yesterday was a positive step .",15,0.5,0.44502267241477966

0,0,"thank you . good morning . in terms of local primary mental health support services , what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the mental health ( wales ) measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people , and how much of this is due to an increase in demand ?",15,0.5,0.31147319078445435
0,0,"yes , thanks very much . so , it 's important to say , i think , at the outset , just by way of reminder , that the target , quite rightly , changed for children and young people . the target changed some years ago for adults , so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children . so , the services were working , a couple of years ago , with significant demand and then a change in the standard . i think you 're absolutely right ; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children , particularly within the 28 days . i would say— . and we 've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce , the staff , who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health , into a bit more of the secondary element , which is why the review being undertaken by the nhs delivery unit into primary care camhs is so critical , because , actually , if we do n't have—and i believe we do n't have—enough capacity in that part of the system , then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this . so , i think we will have seen , by the evidence submission , that demand has increased , not just in wales but in the uk , and it has increased significantly . we are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand—so , we have more contacts , more staff , shorter access times , so that is a good news story . we 've not got it completely sustained at this stage , and therefore the focus of the delivery unit 's primary care camhs report is what more can we do in that part of the system to help to see children and young people or provide consultation and liaison to others and support people at that level of intervention .",15,0.5,0.33480310440063477

0,0,"yes . i think that the thrust of that is absolutely right . so , we absolutely need to see children and families at the earliest intervention and that 's why this is a whole system , not compartmentalised . i think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help—hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist camhs , but can be supported , often by telephone , at that earlier stage . my sense of where we go next , in terms of , you know , you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle ' , as you referred to it in your report , is to make sure we 've got a fully joined-up , multi-agency team approach to that . and i think that will need some resourcing to support that , yet to be fully determined . but yesterday 's announcement about youth work , the government 's commitment to primary care , camhs , et cetera—that 's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist camhs . and just a final note on that , if i may—at the beginning of the programme , we had a report from hafal called 'making sense ' and there were 10 key asks , if you like , of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service . they said , 'please do n't medicalise it'—i 'm paraphrasing now , of course—'please do n't medicalise it ; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then , when we really need help , please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level .

0,0,"yes , i think that 's helpfully laid out in three stages . so , you 're absolutely right , there was a highly successful workshop last week really focusing on early help and enhanced support . it brought all of the agencies together , which was—and actually had a bit of a waiting list , apparently , for places . so , there was a lot of demand and a lot of interest in this . in relation to the next steps , there is a planning group reflection in early july , in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop , and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage . one is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose . the second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area , and then , thirdly , to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps . so , that 's the next stage of that . i 'm pretty sure we 'll come on shortly—or hopefully—to the potential of the regional partnership boards . there is some work that we are doing as a programme with the children 's commissioner in terms of working more with the regional partnership boards in taking forward this work . so , that will run alongside . but during the summer , then , we will be developing that framework approach , and we will be participating in the association of directors of social services conference in september , and then a follow-up workshop in october on this matter . on your question of 'well , what happens after the programme ? ' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme . i 'm pretty secure on the specialist camhs element . that will move , most likely , to the camhs network , which is part of the nhs mental health network . i actually chair the mental health network and that 's one part of that . the whole-school approach element is already settled in government and we 've got a connection in to that . the question that 's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go . i am currently in discussions with welsh government officials around that . i can be very clear of my own view that there needs to be a confident and clear legacy arrangement for this work . we can not afford that we 've come so far for this not now to proceed . i think there 's a huge momentum behind this . i do n't see there would be any obstacles—i hope—in getting that commitment translated into a strong approach , as we move forward . so , i 'm not in a position to say , 'and the legacy arrangements will be— ' , but i am in a position to say that i 'm having those discussions with welsh government officials . they know my view that we 've got to put something in place that is strong and secure as we move forward , and i believe that they are supportive of that .",15,0.5,0.36850738525390625

0,0,"thanks very much for that . without wanting to go back too far in history , i remember coming into this area back in 2014 as i was asked to establish a camhs network . my observation was there was n't really a strong and well-connected clinical community in this area . when we spin forward five years , i can confidently say that there is a strong and well-connected clinical community around specialist camhs . the programme has helped ; the emphasis and the focus of the programme has helped to bring people together with that more common endeavour to understand , actually , there is a good case for consistency in the main , with local variation . there has been a case for much greater learning between organisations . if i just give you an example—you 'll know that the community intensive service teams were put in place in 2015-ish . some areas have them , but a lot of areas did n't . we do have inconsistency in that , but the consistent part is there is a service now right the way across wales for more intensive support to children and young people and their families in their own homes , which helps to prevent admissions and then , where there are admissions , helps to support people to be at home . they 're all called slightly different things . so , i might have referred in my papers to citt , catt , cot and cite . so , they 've all got slightly different names and they 've got slightly different opening hours . the key thrust of this is that there is a backbone , if you like , of a consistent approach with that local variation . we have to check . so , things like frameworks for improvement—there is a coming together of the clinicians and the professionals to agree what that framework for improvement is . that then gets implemented , with some local variation . so , i think the process of moving in that way has been extremely helpful . there will be some variation . we want some variation , to some extent , as places try new things and evaluate new things . so , if i just refer to the previous question that i had , and i talked about hot clinics and different ways of reaching out ; that 's been tried in one area , been evaluated—let 's see the spread of that . so , you 'll know my view on internet counselling , for example ; i feel that is quite a strong offer for children—not necessarily in the specialist end . if that works in one area , why are n't we rolling that out to other areas ? so , i think the framework for improvement has provided a vehicle for those clinicians and professionals to come together . it 's in a stronger place—a much stronger place—than it was five years ago .",15,0.5,0.38387128710746765

0,0,"well , in your work to produce the 'mind over matter ' report , i clearly listened to the views from the police and the recommendations in relation to the police . we 've taken that as a further piece of work under the specialist camhs umbrella , to truly understand what the experiences of the police are and what some of the root issues may be in relation to that . for example , is it that because the cit , cat , cot , cite—the community intensive service—closes at 10 o'clock in a certain area , that actually it 's after that that the network of support is n't as strong , and , if that is the case , what are we going to do about that ? there 's certainly potential in working more regionally or even working between adults ' and children 's in terms of the crisis resolution services that work beyond those hours . so , we are taking an extra look at this , because i could not be 100 per cent confident that , throughout the 24-hour period , we 've got this fully settled . i continue to hear some stories from the police that they are picking up young people and feeling that they 've not got that solid place to go , and we 're following those through .",15,0.5,0.3249377906322479

0,0,"thank you . they 're very big questions in terms of 'why ' . i 'm not sure that anyone really knows why , if i 'm honest , although there is a lot of academic research going on . what we do know is that we are starting to see the scale of those referrals coming through . so , in the information provided , i refer to the nhs digital prevalence report in england , which indicates that about 5.5 per cent of two to four-year-olds have a mental disorder . now , that sounds a bit shocking when we say that , but that 's in the international classification scaling , and , of that , certainly , 2.5 per cent is around autism . i can just testify , in real life , that demand is absolutely growing . so , if i just take my own health board for a moment , we usually have about 75 referrals per year . last year we had 300. so , that has felt very difficult to manage . if i can just give you a sense of what we 've done so far and then what i think is next , i want to recognise the work of dr cath norton and the steering group that 's been established on neurodevelopmental issues under the programme . they had a standing start . they 've done a lot of very , very good work . we now have seven teams in place across wales . we now have a national pathway . we now have a community-of-practice-type environment , and we 're really getting into this . good progress has been made . more people have been seen . more people have been assessed . so , we have made progress . but i 've got a long list of considerations that i think respond to your question . one is that most referrals that come through , the clinicians tell me , are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support . so , that is often the reason why people come . now , that is obviously going to be linked to the whole-school approach and how we can support that . demand is outstripping supply . so , our clinical teams are concerned about how do they keep up . so , if i just take my own example of 300 in the last year , we 're looking to try and put some additional capacity in to support seeing those families , but also then to understand what the long-term trajectory is going to be . because we 've put these teams in , because we 've got the new pathway , has that opened a gate and we 've got a lot of backlog or is that the pattern ?",15,0.5,0.36507338285446167

1,0,"yes , thank you very much for that question . again , quite a lot of progress has been made in the early part of the programme around in-patients , and you are very well aware of the challenges over the last year or 18 months in relation to both units . i think , certainly , there is some recovery in the position in north wales , and the programme did a peer review visit to north wales , which i think was very helpful . in terms of where the programme has been on this issue , there is some work under way , at quite an advanced stage , around the art of the possible around enhancing the scope of the services . this was quite a tricky thing to start off when you 're in a position where , actually , there 've been some restrictions , to then ask the service to think about going even further , but we really wanted to see what the art of the possible would be if we could attract the right workforce , get the right environment , et cetera , et cetera—so , that piece of work , the review of the specification about what could be possible . clearly , we work very closely with welsh health specialised services committee as the commissioner , so we do n't commission that . we neither performance manage those environments . but , if i can just say , probably the most important part of moving forward now is the longer term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined up approach for children . we believe there would probably be about 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings . we have n't got that mature approach in terms of these being joined-up teams ; we 've got social care and we 've got healthcare . there is a growing appetite to do something different . there is a meeting with the children 's commissioner on 9 july to explore that . i 've previously had conversations with the chief inspector of care inspectorate wales , for example , and we have now got , i think , a consensus growing that we need to do something very different for children and young people who are in this sort of need for the future . we also know that there 've been some high-profile legal cases as well . so , we 've got to move to that step now . it has been largely successful , the work that has taken place over recent years , but not without its key challenges .",15,0.5,0.5158308744430542

0,0,"thank you very much , chair . my amendments 1 and 4 will place a duty on welsh ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the act commences . i tabled these amendments in response to this committee 's recommendation—this was a recommendation from this committee in the stage 1 report , so i have responded to that . i 've already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from royal assent , should the bill be passed . i 've considered amendments 1a to 1e , which have been tabled by janet finch-saunders , and which relate to the duty to raise awareness . amendment 1a introduces a reference to public understanding . we do n't think , actually , that this adds anything to the government amendment , which already mentions awareness . it makes the awareness-raising duty open-ended with no time limit , which is not necessary . by commencement , messaging around the change in the law will be embedded . the awareness-raising campaign will continue for a number of years . therefore , an ongoing duty referring specifically to the law change would not be required . i understand , of course , that the awareness-raising campaign needs to be comprehensive , well planned and to reach out to all those people and all those communities who need to be aware of the law change , and understand how to respond to it . but i do n't think it 's helpful or necessary to highlight specific groups , such as visitors to wales , on the face of the bill—that 's the approach taken in amendment 1e—as it risks placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others . in relation to children , the committee will know that i 'm fully committed to children ’ s rights , and that welsh ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions . an additional due regard requirement , such as the one set out in amendment 1d , relating specifically to the need to promote awareness among children is not needed . this would be part and parcel of the welsh government approach to putting children ’ s rights at the heart of our policy making . similarly , i do n't think it 's necessary for the bill to set out specifically the topics that need to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign , as is suggested in amendments 1b and 1c . that level of detail , i do n't think , is for the face of the bill . information required about parenting support will be considered by the parenting expert group , under the auspices of the bill ’ s strategic implementation group , working with my officials and the expert stakeholder group on the awareness-raising campaign . and , really , their thinking should not be constrained in any way by specifications on the face of the bill . i think we always need to bear in mind that what the bill does is remove a defence to an existing criminal offence ; it does not create a new offence . and in this context , it does n't make sense for this bill to contain a provision requiring the provision of information about how a person may raise concerns if it appears to them that a child is being physically punished . as i set out in my letter to this committee responding to recommendation 15 on this point , safeguarding is everyone ’ s business , and , as now , the public have a role in highlighting to relevant services if they are concerned about a child . i 'm asking for the support of members for amendments 1 and 4 , and i ask members to reject amendments 1a to 1e because this would place unnecessary provisions on the face of the bill .",15,0.5,0.45790454745292664

1,0,"thank you , chair . i wish to speak to amendments 1a to 1e , which relate to the deputy minister 's amendment on the duty to promote public awareness . while we believe it is absolutely imperative that the public are made aware of this controversial change in the law , the deputy minister 's amendment lacks a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at stage 1. an important thread runs throughout each and every amendment that i 've tabled within this group—that of a sustained awareness campaign , which not only stretches beyond the implementation of the bill , but serves as a duty for future administrations . amendment 1a : primarily , amendment 1a changes amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law . i do n't think it 's enough for the welsh government to say that the public should be made aware of the coming into force of section 1 and that a public awareness campaign needs to be sustained until the welsh government 's objectives have been achieved . despite the fact that it is intended to change behaviour , the consequences of this law are far greater than that of organ donation or prohibiting smoking indoors . instead of an opt-out system or a civil offence , this law will remove a defence for parents , information on which could be there on their records for the rest of their lives , potentially separate parents , and could affect employment chances . as such , whilst we agree with the necessity of the awareness campaign , it is important too that the welsh government take stock and ensures that parents are not penalised due to a weak awareness campaign . the witnesses we heard before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands—",15,0.5,0.5008865594863892

' if you are intent on removing the defence of reasonable punishment , it is therefore not unreasonable to ensure that law-abiding parents fully understand the ramifications of this bill . additionally , the committee found that while the current welsh government 's intention to deliver a public awareness campaign was beyond doubt , future governments may have less of a commitment . this places further weight on the fact that the welsh government should be under a duty to promote awareness and understanding of the bill beyond its commencement . furthermore , the children ( equal protection from assault ) ( scotland ) bill quite clearly notes that , under section 2 , the scottish ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of section 1 on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment . therefore , i would be grateful if the deputy minister can respond as to the reasons why the welsh government has deviated from this course of action in their amendment .

0,0,"thank you , chair . the amendments in this group are to do with the post-implementation review of the bill , and i believe there was also a committee recommendation to this end from your committee , so you strongly influenced this amendment . it 's clear from members ' contributions to this group and recommendations by the committee at stage 1 that they share my commitment to the importance of post-implementation review of the effect of the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment . i 've already provided assurance that i agree with the importance placed on such a review , both in the explanatory memorandum and during stage 1 scrutiny . i also made a commitment to bring forward a government amendment to put a duty to undertake a post-implementation review on the face of the bill . i have done this with amendment 2. amendment 5 sets out that this provision will come into force the day after royal assent . as i said in my responses to the stage 1 committee report , and as set out in the explanatory memorandum , the post-implementation review of this bill will not be a single piece of work , but a continuous programme of work during the years following the commencement of section 1. firstly , we will continue to conduct attitudinal surveys , which will be used to track changes in attitude towards the physical punishment of children and prevalence of parents reporting that they use physical punishment . the surveys will also be used to monitor the effectiveness of our awareness-raising campaign . secondly , through a dedicated task and finish group , we are working with organisations to put in place arrangements to establish robust methods for capturing meaningful data relating to the bill and to consider the possible impact on services . turning to amendment 2c , this amendment would require welsh ministers to prepare and lay before the assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 is commenced . this amendment is unnecessary and is in conflict with what i think is a priority for the implementation of this bill : that is , given certainty on the commencement date and in enabling us to work towards this with our partners and stakeholders . i also think this amendment is not required because , as i 've already stated , we are preparing to assess the effectiveness of our awareness raising . in june , i shared the findings of a representative survey , which establishes a baseline on public awareness and opinion towards physical punishment of children and the proposed legislation . i shared this with the committee .",15,0.5,0.4186258018016815

0,0,"thank you , chair . i speak to amendments 2c , excluding 2d , to 2k , which relate to the deputy minister 's amendment 2 on preparing a published report on the effect of abolishing the defence of reasonable punishment . again , i must stress the importance of getting this right due to the controversial and long-lasting effects of removing the defence of reasonable punishment . amendments 2e to 2k outline what we would expect to be within this report , and we would wish to see a commitment from the deputy minister to ensure the national assembly for wales is fully apprised and able to scrutinise the result of this report . amendment 2c requests that the welsh government prepare a report on the awareness-raising campaign and lays it before the assembly before section 1 commences . as i have outlined under my amendments in group 1 , the understanding of the public about the implications of the bill can not be sidelined . although the deputy minister has repeated her commitment to a public awareness campaign , we , as the national assembly for wales , must be able to scrutinise its effectiveness before section 1 begins . as i noted under amendments 1b to 1e , there are specific groups of people who need to be evaluated on their understanding of the bill 's effect . i 'm sure that the deputy minister will agree that the harder-to-reach groups are undoubtedly the most vulnerable to any negative impacts that the bill will have because of the greater potential of a lack of awareness . it is , therefore , important for the assembly to be able to determine whether the awareness-raising campaign has had a positive effect on these groups of people . as will also be elaborated under amendment 2d , it is extremely important that we , as the parliament of wales , are fully apprised of the awareness-raising campaign 's impact . before we implement what will be a criminal offence , it is vital that we ensure that those affected are not adversely impacted because of a poorly targeted awareness campaign . therefore , i would be grateful if the deputy minister would commit to an independent evaluation of the awareness campaign 's effects before section 1 commences .",15,0.5,0.4846952557563782

0,0,"thank you , chair . deputy minister , first of all , can i just say thank you for your opening remarks about the possibility of perhaps doing some work around amendment 2b ? i 'll come to that a little bit later , if i may . i just want to begin by commenting briefly on what you said about why you 'll be rejecting amendment 2c here . i actually do n't think that this amendment should affect or jeopardise the commencement date in any way at all . it 's an operational requirement to get this work done before the commencement date that 's in the draft bill at the moment . so , failing to meet that would be as a result of operations not going well , rather than anything intrinsic in the bill , so i 'm not sure i can accept your argument on that . and , on 2d—very pleased to hear that you 'd be willing to introduce something about 'laying ' rather than 'publishing ' at stage 3 , but , in the spirit of recognising that this is the legislature , perhaps i could encourage you just to accept the amendment at this stage , because it does n't make any difference . your amendment is going to pass , and this amendment to it would be—i think the gesture there would be very much appreciated . i 'll be speaking mainly to amendments 2a and 2b , but i want to begin , again , by thanking you for moving some way on this and considering amendments to the bill on the issue of reporting , because i know you were keen to avoid amendments in the name of simplicity ; you mentioned it earlier . but this is not a newid bychan , i 'm afraid , siân ; the terms and the effect of this bill are quite extensive , and it does need the reassurances , if you like , necessary to mitigate potentially disproportionate effects of this bill on families where parents ' actions had been lawful up until this point in statute . it does need statutory underpinning . so , i am grateful to you for accepting this duty . i know that you 're sincere that you want this duty to report to show that the bill is effective in stopping smacking as a punishment , and also that it is not as harmful to parents as perhaps some of us fear . but , if this were me bringing forward this bill , i think i 'd want to show the world that i was doing the right thing a lot sooner than you appear to wish to do . amendment 2 means that the efficacy of the bill will not formally be assessed until seven years after it has passed . there are acts on the statute book that have lasted a lot less time than that . if you 're relying on the two-year period before section 1 comes into operation to do much of the heavy lifting on the culture change , and i think that is what you 're expecting—you know , showing a reduction in the incidence of physical punishment , reducing the number of , and indeed the likelihood of , parents putting themselves in the path of criminal liability once those two years are up—i really would have thought you 'd want people to know sooner , or as soon as the first possible opportunity on that . waiting five years , i think , will diminish the ability of you to prove the efficacy of those initial two years , and this is why i 'm grateful to you for your offer , because there may be a way where we can overcome that . if the trend of culture change is continuing after year 3—so , basically , in the first year after section 1 comes into effect—that 's great , but there 's a possibility it 's going to reverse . again , i do n't think i 'd want to wait five years to find that out . for myself , i think one year would probably be enough , but i think three years is a reasonable compromise , as opposed to five years , for a reporting period . i think seven years is just way too long for a formal evaluation of a bill 's effectiveness . i ca n't see the reason for quite that length of time—i know you 've talked about new zealand—but neither can the constitutional and legislative affairs committee . i think that 's worth pointing out . when they took the step of recommending this duty to evaluate and report , they also took the step of suggesting a three-year reporting period being more in keeping with other post-legislative scrutiny . that 's something i think we perhaps need to bear in mind now , as we enter this period of the consolidation of law . five/seven years is really something of an outlier , and while that might have been appropriate , perhaps , in new zealand , i do n't think that fits in with our timetables generally here in wales , and , of course , there are other countries that have introduced this over a period of years , and i note that you have n't drawn on them in order to support your argument . so , can i urge members and the minister to consider the arguments behind these amendments ? i do n't think it 's going to reassure anyone—you may want to intervene at this point , hefin—that we not only wo n't hear in this assembly , we wo n't hear in the next assembly , about the formal evaluation of this , unless i follow—",15,0.5,0.37996339797973633

0,0,"okay , well , as i say , i think , actually , the deputy minister 's offer of a three-year interim period might be part of a resolution to this . because i 'm not 100 per cent sure i accept your argument , either , because it closes it down for the interim period if we do n't move on with the deputy minister 's suggestion—which i 'll talk about now , actually . because i am tempted to accept your offer . it absolutely makes sense and it 's clearly made with the best good faith here . but i need some clarity on what you would allow this assembly to do in helping define the terms of that interim report . because you 've been very clear that you do n't want to accept the things that janet finch-saunders has been talking about in a final report , and yet i can tell you we want to hear about these things . so , if you 're in a position where you can give a commitment at stage 3 not only to introduce an interim report , but that you will consult with , perhaps , this committee—i 'll leave it to you—on the contents of that interim report , what we would want to see tested , then i 'll be minded not to move amendment 2b . if you ca n't give me that reassurance , then i 'm going to move it anyway and we 'll return to it at stage 3 , if you do n't mind . just a final point on this issue of reporting within three months rather than as soon as practicable , and i do take your point that there may be a misalignment with reporting periods from the organisations you hope to talk to . again , at stage 3 , i 'm happy if you want to make three months six months , or something like that , but 'as soon as practicable ' is open ended , and what you think is practicable may be very different from what i or my constituents think is practicable . so , i do n't want to stick with what is practicable ; i would like you to put a date on this . if it 's a case that you think six months is long enough for data gathering and reporting from third parties , i think that 's fairly reasonable as well , but i 'm not minded to allow you to just keep this open ended . thank you .",15,0.5,0.42834073305130005

0,0,"thank you very much , chair , and bore da . i was going to ask some general questions about the value of the baccalaureate . could you give us your views on how the welsh bac is valued by learners and teachers ?",15,0.5,0.4362868666648865
0,0,"bore da , julie , and thank you very much for your question . firstly , i 'd like to begin by saying that i as the cabinet secretary value the qualification very much indeed . i believe that it helps ensure that we are able to give our young people in wales a broad and balanced curriculum , recognising the need to develop knowledge and skills in core subjects but recognising also that the purpose of education is to help prepare our children for further study and the world of work , and i believe that the skills challenge element of the baccalaureate does just that . i meet with young people and teachers all the time who tell me about the positive experiences they have had studying for the welsh bac , and much of that was evidenced in qualifications wales 's review into the welsh baccalaureate . they did focus group work with a representative sample , and many of the learners expressed the fact that they have enjoyed studying for the qualification and have gained a great deal from it . i meet regularly with individuals who have been able to use their bac to successfully gain a place at university , so i believe there 's a huge value for welsh young people being able to study this particular qualification alongside the more traditional qualifications that perhaps we 're all used to . i think the challenge is that , given that many people are very familiar with what a gcse is and , as parents , we will know what that is and many of us will have done—some of us are so old we 'll have done o-levels . we know what those traditional qualifications look like , and therefore a new qualification—there 's always a job of work to do to communicate that , if people are n't used to it , but i value it hugely . i think that , whilst there is always room for improvement—and , of course , you 'll be aware of the review that qualifications wales undertook and that has suggested ways in which we can further improve and refine the qualification , but i think it is a valuable piece of work for welsh young people to undertake .",15,0.5,0.36393946409225464
0,0,it 's great that you 've been around listening to learners and what they have said about it . have you had any negative feedback ?,15,0.5,0.43117988109588623
0,0,"well , occasionally , of course , we do have concerns raised with us , and those concerns are similar to the ones that have been raised in the qualifications wales review . so , for instance , we sometimes have concerns about how some students balance the welsh bac with other qualifications they may be taking . some teachers feed back around the workload issues associated with the welsh baccalaureate . for some students , there may be concerns about the nature of the welsh bac and whether that can impact negatively on their well-being . and , obviously , that 's why qualifications wales have undertaken this piece of work so that we can refine , if necessary , that qualification and how we continue to look at how we ensure my belief that taking the welsh bac should be the norm for students but also recognising that , in some cases , there needs to be flexibility to ensure that the well-being of the student is not compromised .",15,0.5,0.457049697637558
0,0,and so would you say that it 's valued by learners more or less at key stage 4 or post 16 ?,15,0.5,0.31914928555488586
0,0,"well , i think that , as i said , the vast majority of students i meet report very positively about the opportunities that are afforded for studying at that level . occasionally , we hear from students who i believe think that in studying the subject they may be compromising their chances because they want to do additional a-levels , and i 'm sure we 'll come on to , later on , whether universities , and whether the russell group universities in particular , value the qualification . but i feel that there are particular strengths . and i think what 's really important , and , in talking to universities , since the qualification became graded , rather than just a pass/fail qualification—i think that added rigour since 2015 has been particularly important in ensuring that there 's real value in students undertaking that work .",15,0.5,0.3249770402908325
0,0,and what about the effect that the leadership in the school has on the way that the bac is received ? have you— ?,15,0.5,0.4087485074996948
0,0,"as always , julie , leadership is crucial , and students ' experiences can be very coloured by the attitude towards the teacher delivering that particular course . and , therefore , we need to continue , alongside the wjec and qualifications wales , to ensure that the welsh bac is communicated to children in a positive way , the benefits are explained to children and their parents , and , also , we need to ensure that those who are tasked with teaching welsh bac in their schools or colleges feel confident in their ability to do so and to ensure that students have a really positive experience of that qualification , because if you 're being taught by someone who is telling you , 'oh , i do n't know why we 're having to do this ' , then , obviously that 's going to colour how you feel about it . and , if i 'm honest , i recently attended a youth forum , where young people from the county were discussing all sorts of issues—everything from the environment to their experience in school—and i was struck by the group of year 12 and year 13 students . i specifically asked them about the bac—i always take the opportunity to ask them about their experience of the baccalaureate . one school , the group of students said , 'it 's fantastic . we really enjoy it . it 's really valuable . i 'm learning a lot . ' students from a school seven miles away—just seven miles away—said , 'oh , i do n't know why we 're having to do this . ' and i suspect that that has got more to do with how that is being delivered in their institutions than it has about the quality of the qualification . so , we need to keep ensuring that those who are tasked with this see it as important , communicate that to students , and have the confidence and the ability to deliver a really positive experience .",15,0.5,0.3436583876609802
0,0,"i think our experiences in the committee are very similar . within the same room , actually , we 've had two completely different sets of views . so , what do you intend to do to try to ensure that there 's consistent support and enthusiasm for the bac from the leaders ?",15,0.5,0.37947508692741394
0,0,"well , first of all , we have the design group of qualifications wales looking to address some of the issues that arose out of the report around ensuring that , especially from a teacher workload perspective , it 's not too onerous in terms of assessment . so , there 's that to do to make sure that we 're not asking children to duplicate and do things over and over and over again , which , of course , for any of us , would be wearing and we would question to the value of . so , there 's the design group looking at the qualification itself . we are ensuring , as part of our professional learning for teachers that— . there are existing opportunities via the regional consortia for support for teaching of the qualification . the wjec has resources and support available , but we will look , as we roll out our national approach to professional learning , at that the professional learning needs of those already in the system are addressed . of course , our accreditation for our new initial teacher education is predominantly addressed at being able to deliver the new curriculum , but , if you think about the elements of 'successful futures ' and the skills and the knowledge and the pedagogy associated with that , it 's very much in line with the welsh baccalaureate challenge certificate . so , actually , there are opportunities via initial teacher education as well , and we continue to need to look to work with our partners to be able to reinforce why this is a worthwhile qualification . and i have to say i think the best people to do that— . it 's not me . i 'd like to see past students of the welsh baccalaureate being able to talk about their own experiences and why it 's made a difference to them . i come across individuals for whom their place at university has been secured by that welsh baccalaureate , and , all of a sudden , if that 's what 's got you your place , it becomes a lot more valuable than perhaps it was six months before . we need to make sure that students are aware , and teachers and school leaders are aware , of the importance that this qualification has .",15,0.5,0.39289695024490356

0,0,"yes . i 've got one on it , but i 'll leave that one . i just want to go back to julie 's question about whether there was a different perspective or a different sense of value for students who are post 16 and those who are pre 16. when one of the college leaders here was asked whether he had people coming to him in his fe college who 've been through the pre-16 bac and had heard evidence or had stories of , basically , those children cobbling together their bac in the last four weeks of term before they got there , he said that yes , that is his experience . does that worry you at all , because , of course , the whole purpose of bac is to teach skills over a period of time , and its purpose can not be fulfilled by getting it all done in the last term of—which year am i in ? —year 11 , in order to satisfy the curriculum ?",15,0.5,0.39387577772140503
0,0,"yes . obviously , that 's not the experience that we would want young people to have , and , as someone who has had a daughter just finish year 11 , that 's certainly not the experience that my daughter had in her particular school , and i have another daughter who has just gone into year 10 , where the welsh bac has started in year 10 and it is a a two-year course in which elements are undertaken . obviously , we will need to address , as part of the design group and the work that qualifications wales is doing , how that is playing out in individual schools . but that would not be a positive experience ; we want this to be taken in exactly the same way as we would expect a gcse to be taught over a period of two years . but , andrew , i do n't know if there 's anything you 'd like to add from the college perspective .",15,0.5,0.27732840180397034
0,0,"i think it is variable . i think that it will depend on the feeder schools to the colleges and it 'll depend upon the delivery models that are in existence in those schools . it 's been around as a qualification now for about a decade , i think . there have been differences in the way that the subject has been—sorry , not the subject , the qualification has been delivered . and i think it 'll be helped by a recent review by qualifications wales , because they 're doing a survey at the moment as to different delivery models in different locations , and that , perhaps , will inform more even practice as we move forwards .",15,0.5,0.40833762288093567

0,0,"i think the variability can be perhaps explained by the fact that it 's a new type of qualification , the fact that different schools have adopted it at different rates—",15,0.5,0.41683974862098694
0,0,ten years ?,15,0.5,0.45296505093574524
0,0,"well , as i said , over that time , there were some early adopters who have done it in a certain way , there are some people who 've come later to it , who may be doing it in a different way . and , as i said , it 's quite a different departure from traditional o-levels , from gcse-type subjects , where there is a programme of work and a syllabus . so , it is a different nature of qualification , and , therefore , as andrew has just alluded to , schools have approached it in a different way . we are alert to that and qualifications wales , crucially , is alert to that , and we are looking to ensure greater consistency in how it is delivered in individual schools . we 're also aware , in the school setting , in pre 16 , there are some concerns about the onerousness of the workload associated with the evaluation of the students ' work . now , clearly , there is a difference between onerous and rigorous . we wrote the qualification to be a rigorous qualification for the students , but we do n't want it to be jeopardised by the evaluation of it being too onerous . so , there 's that balance to be struck . again , that 's one of the issues that the design group and qualifications wales are looking at . that process is a really important process , so there is the design group , but working alongside the design group , who they are testing the messages and testing their thoughts with , is a stakeholder group , and there is also a practitioners group . so , that work by the design group is being tested with those people who have an interest : business , for instance , the world of work—is this qualification really giving students the skills that are valued by potential employers ? —but it 's also testing its thinking with the practitioners , those people who will be charged with the delivery of the qualification , and i think that 's really important to be able to get an understanding of the challenges of making sure there 's a consistency , and what are the barriers to that , and what steps need to be taken to ensure a greater level of consistency in delivery .",15,0.5,0.29075130820274353
0,0,"is there a correlation between consistency in general ? because we know that there 's polarisation in the secondary school sector between the good schools and the not-so-good schools . and is there a correlation between—if the schools are good according to estyn , or excellent , are they also good , excellent at delivering the bac ? is it a fundamental inconsistency across the sector that 's causing this inconsistency ?",15,0.5,0.37703123688697815

0,0,"because some of the evidence we 've heard is that if the leadership is good around the bac in the school , well , everything else follows from that . so , it makes sense to me that it could be .",15,0.5,0.32795780897140503

0,0,"fine . i 'll turn , therefore , to the understanding of employers of the welsh bac and the skills challenge certificate . from the evidence that we 've had , it appears that there is a problem in this area , that is , employers generally do n't value the qualification . is that your experience , and how can we improve that ? how can we elicit more engagement from employers of all sizes with the value of the baccalaureate ?",15,0.5,0.3416294753551483
0,0,"well , the first thing to say is my understanding of the development of the bac is that employers ' voices were reflected and they were part of the process that drew up the qualification in the first place . you 'll be aware of the review by qualifications wales that found that many employers say that the skills that are developed through the baccalaureate are exactly the kinds of skills that they want young people to be acquiring whilst at school , that put them in a good place for looking for employment later . i would agree with you , siân , and not just in terms of the bac , there are lots of reasons why we need greater working between education and employers . i sit down with employer organisations to try and explore better ways in which we can work together—everything from ensuring that children have work experience opportunities through to , for instance , what more some of our companies could do to take up governors ' roles , for instance , in our local schools , so that employer voice and that business voice are heard at a school management level . i think these things are really important . it 's something that 's sometimes difficult . there are some excellent examples of really good practice where local employers work really closely with schools . i think of sony in bridgend doing a really , really , really good job working with their local schools . in other areas , where you have n't got such a big employer , it can be difficult , ca n't it , for a small business that is trying to do their small business to think about , 'oh my goodness , i 've got to do something to help improve the education system as well . ' so , i 'm always looking at new ways in which we can get that working together . as i said , the qualifications wales design group has a stakeholder group that is helping them with their review into the qualification at the moment , but there are really good examples where employers and other organisations are working together . we also need to continue , i think , to communicate more clearly with employers the nature of the qualification . again , because it 's relatively new , and the brands of the gcse and a-level are so strong , people know what they are , unless you 've either done the welsh bac yourself or you have a son or a daughter , or a grandson or granddaughter who has gone through the process , you 're probably going to be less familiar , and we need to continue to work together with the wjec and qualifications wales as a government to better communicate the value of the qualification .",15,0.5,0.387325644493103

0,0,"yes , and we are working closely with , as i said , qualifications wales to develop a joint communication plan , and we continue , as i said , as part of qualifications wales 's review into the nature of the qualification—employers ' voices are being heard as part of that particular piece of work . but more generally , yes , i think there 's more that we can do to better engage employers with the education system in lots and lots of different ways .",15,0.5,0.3794436752796173

0,0,"i think making it a graded qualification has been really important , and i make no apologies for this qualification being rigorous—no apologies for that at all . that 's how it should be , and that 's how you create value , by ensuring that a qualification is rigorous . what 's really important is that it 's not just me saying that it 's rigorous ; there is an independent process that benchmarks qualifications . the fact is that at advanced level—because i do n't know if you 're making these observations about the pre-16 welsh bac , or whether we 're talking about the advanced level qualification—that is the equivalent of an a-level . it 's been benchmarked against a-levels . it has a ucas tariff associated with it . it is used by universities as a means of qualification that gains entrance into a university in just the same way as an a-level is . so , therefore , i do n't have any concerns about the rigour of the qualification . in terms of spoon-feeding , one of the reasons why universities like the qualification is that it 's very difficult , for instance , in the individual project work to be spoon-fed . it is very demanding of individual students , and it 's very difficult in a way . that 's one of the reasons why it 's valuable , is n't it , because it teaches a different set of skills ? because if you 're doing a traditional , say , history a-level or a science a-level , there 's a very strict syllabus and a course , there 's a textbook and people are taught to that particular syllabus ; with the welsh bac , it is individual students that have to think , for instance , of their own individual project . you ca n't get those off a shelf , and you ca n't necessarily just find that information easily . there 's real skill involved in being able to do that well and get graded well for that . so , i do not have concerns about the rigour . i do have concerns about some of the feedback by qualifications wales about the onerousness of the evaluation and what that means for teacher workload , which is one of the things that qualifications wales is looking at . but in terms of rigour and people being spoon-fed , then i do n't share those concerns .",15,0.5,0.39341771602630615
0,0,"okay , because those were concerns , in the main , that were articulated by people delivering the welsh bac—by teachers . so , i suppose the question then comes back to some of the other points that were being raised about the consistency , because that may well be from those teachers in schools where they 're not taking the bac as seriously as some others are .",15,0.5,0.46998563408851624
0,0,"and , of course , there would be— . there is a professional responsibility for those teachers delivering that qualification to ensure that the ethos of that qualification and the skills— . it would potentially be a disservice to students if that qualification was being delivered in that way .",15,0.5,0.4312669634819031
0,0,"and i think what i was trying to do was to highlight the different opinions , because we also heard from teachers who were saying that those involved with teaching and studying understood absolutely its rigour , so it was the mixed message , i guess , i was just trying to test out with you . similarly , on the skills challenge certificate , again we 've heard from various stakeholders about whether , in fact , this is considered to be an equivalent qualification . we 've heard people say that it is different—it 's not the same as an a-level—so , therefore you ca n't absolutely hold it up and say it 's the same as an a-level . it requires different skills , and so on and so forth . so , just your thoughts and views on that , really , as an equivalent qualification .",15,0.5,0.36667492985725403
0,0,"it 's not a question of if this is an equivalent qualification ; this is an equivalent qualification . there is a rigorous process that is undertaken to evaluate these qualifications independent of the government , and it 's not a question . is it a different model and a different way of studying ? yes , of course it is , and that 's why we do it . that 's why i want children and young people to do both sets of qualifications , because it does engage and expand the acquisition of knowledge and skills . so , yes , it 's different . is it equivalent ? yes , it is , and that 's why , since the graded qualification came in , it is regarded by independent bodies as an equivalent to an a-level , and it has a tariff for ucas in the same way as a-levels would have tariffs . you only have to speak to the institutes of higher education who use this qualification as a way of setting grades—you know , offers—for students that they see that in the same way as well .",15,0.5,0.4325363039970398
1,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.5125256776809692
0,0,suzy 's got a supplementary before we go on to talk in detail about universities .,15,0.5,0.4368785321712494
0,0,"is that okay ? because i just want to go back to this element of spoon-feeding at post 16 , where you said it 's actually very difficult for that to occur , because , obviously , we 're talking about the personal project , and so forth . we heard evidence in one of the schools sessions we did that baccalaureate students were being offered a very short and narrow list of subjects on which they could do their personal project , which actually limited the scope of what they were able to do . and we 've also heard separately—it may have been with the colleges , i ca n't quite remember now—that some students were being told , 'on your personal project , just put in what you did for your gcse-level baccalaureate , and add a few paragraphs . ' i 'm wondering how easy it is to disguise spoon-feeding at post 16 when we 've got two instances there that , to me , suggest it 's more about the convenience of the teachers , who perhaps may not be very enthusiastic about the bac , rather than making sure those children get the best out of the qualification .",15,0.5,0.3066041171550751
0,0,"yes . and that would be really disappointing . and , again , if i can use my own personal family experience , my daughter has tried that on with her welsh bac teacher . she 's in a different school from where she did her earlier bac , and she said , 'oh , well , i 'll just rehash my `` votes at 16 '' that i did last year ' , and the welsh bac teacher has said , 'under no circumstances are you to do that—no , that 's not allowed . ' this is about using your individual project , linked to something that maybe you hope to study at university , to get the value out of this qualification , and for you to be able to use this in your personal statement , and potentially in an interview . so , again , i guess what this does is show that there 's a variation , but certainly , where it is being delivered well , then that practice would not be encouraged , because it would be seen to be—",15,0.5,0.35816633701324463

0,0,okay . we 've got some questions now on how universities view it . hefin david .,15,0.5,0.3998154103755951
0,0,"we 've had an online survey response , which was quite a stark comment , not from the vice-chancellor 's office , but from a member of staff within cardiff university . and it said : 'the welsh bacc is not a fair substitute for a full a-level , and should not be regarded as such . i consider it to be a disadvantage for welsh students , compared with their english counterparts . ' can you reflect on that ?",15,0.5,0.3909209370613098
0,0,i do n't agree .,15,0.5,0.45495370030403137
0,0,"do you think that that 's a view that 's held within universities , and are you concerned about that ? because it is a view that 's obviously held within cardiff university .",15,0.5,0.31642386317253113
1,0,no ; i would say that that is a view held by an individual in cardiff university—,15,0.5,0.5640541315078735
0,0,who has influence over students .,15,0.5,0.48781517148017883
0,0,"well , that is a view held by an individual in cardiff university . and , actually , cardiff university—indeed , all welsh universities—accept the welsh baccalaureate as an a-level equivalent . i think it is really important to reflect on the wide range of opportunities at higher education that the welsh bac affords individuals . that means that it is deemed as an equivalent to a-level for the vast majority of universities , to get in to some of the most competitive courses , such as dentistry , medicine , veterinary science . so , those courses where we know there 's a high demand and high competition for places , there are institutions that are using that , including cardiff to get into their medical degree .",15,0.5,0.3687087297439575
1,0,"nick brazil , the deputy principal of gower college , said about 50 per cent of the russell group do n't value the welsh bac .",15,0.5,0.5191410779953003
0,0,"well , i do n't know where he 's getting that from . i have made it a personal commitment to establish this with universities . i have visited both cambridge and oxford . i spoke again to cambridge , oxford , bath , southampton , st andrews , only last week , who were exhibiting at the seren conference . i specifically took the opportunity to meet with those universities and to talk to them about how they feel about the welsh bac . they have a high regard for the welsh baccalaureate in a variety of ways . first of all , for many of those universities , for many of their courses , they use the welsh bac as an equivalent to an a-level . if they do n't , there are some courses , for instance , where they will lower their offer to gain a place at that university if the welsh bac is passed at a certain level . so , for instance , rather than maybe offering a welsh student a , a , b , they would offer a welsh student a , b , b , plus a welsh bac , thus giving students two opportunities to gain a place at that university , either with or without their welsh bac qualification . even for those universities that do n't use the welsh baccalaureate as a formal part of their offer—and this is the conversation i had again last week with oxford and cambridge—they value it as part of a student 's personal statement ; they value it as part of the interview process in which a student may or may not then be offered a place at that university ; and they also recognise that the skills learnt by students whilst undertaking the welsh baccalaureate are exactly the skills that those students need to make a successful transition from a-level work to university-type work , which , if you can imagine , is very much based on individual research and being able to guide your own learning . so , i just do n't recognise that in some way welsh students are being disadvantaged . the message i get consistently from universities is that there are significant advantages to welsh learners taking this qualification .",15,0.5,0.36697614192962646
0,0,"okay . you can not recognise it , but that is contrary to the evidence that we 've received . i 'm not saying that the evidence is conclusive , but it actually demonstrates inconsistency . so , would you go so far as to accept instead then that there is an inconsistency in the way that universities use the welsh bac as a tool for application ?",15,0.5,0.3503047525882721
0,0,"you would know better than anybody , hefin , that universities are autonomous institutions and they set their own methods of entry into those institutions . what i 'm telling you is that the evidence that i have received from universities is that , whilst there is a variety of approaches to how they regard the qualification in terms of offers , consistently , absolutely across the board , all universities tell me that the welsh baccalaureate is a valuable qualification and does not disadvantage welsh students .",15,0.5,0.4803840219974518
1,0,"if the committee were to produce a report based on the evidence we 've received , that would be contrary to what you 've just said . so , i think we 'd end up in a debate in which we are setting out different points of view . so , would you therefore commit to exploring that perspective ?",15,0.5,0.5067296028137207
0,0,"hefin , i would argue that i have indeed explored that perspective because i have taken the trouble to find out first-hand—not via my officials , but first-hand—from those institutions , their views . so , this is not something that is hearsay ; i have undertaken to ascertain the views of those universities . we have written to all vice-chancellors—last year—with regard to the welsh baccalaureate qualification . qualifications wales has an individual whose specific job it is to ensure that universities across the united kingdom understand the value of welsh qualifications . that will become increasingly important as we see a divergence between english and welsh qualifications . but i have to say that the evidence that i have from universities is that the welsh baccalaureate , whilst it may be used in different ways in terms of an offer , the consistency from all universities is that it is a valuable qualification . if you 've heard differently from admissions tutors and from the universities officially , rather than from somebody who has e-mailed in , then i would be pleased to look at that evidence , because it would be in stark contrast to what i am being told by universities .",15,0.5,0.44661542773246765

0,0,"hefin , each individual institution and university the length and breadth of the uk have different ways in which they make offers to individuals . what is absolutely clear to me , and if the concern is around the type of institution— . so , for instance , it is accepted as a third-grade offer in bristol , edinburgh , exeter , lancaster , leeds , leicester , liverpool , the london school of economics—some of the highest performing universities and russell group universities . it is accepted as a fourth qualification or amends the offer in places like bath university , and it is accepted in tariff-point offers in places like hull and the university of the west of england . so there is a variety of ways in which universities use the qualification , and that is their prerogative—that 's their prerogative as institutions . they will have different ways in which they recruit and how they offer places , just like different universities will have different views on unconditional offers . you know , there 's a difference in universities there , is n't there ? some universities do n't have unconditional offers at all ; other universities—",15,0.5,0.40853142738342285
0,0,"so , what you 're saying is that the problem is n't connected to the welsh bac , it 's connected with just the way that universities make offers , and the welsh bac has got nothing to do with it .",15,0.5,0.44150903820991516
0,0,"i ’ m saying there is a variety . just like any other qualification , there is a variety in how universities use qualifications for offers . what i ’ m saying to you is that , in the conversations that i have had with russell group universities , what they say is that there is certainly no detriment to any welsh student undertaking this qualification . they value the qualification . they think it is useful . it develops a set of skills that help students to make that transition into higher education . and therefore , i think it is a myth—i would go as far as to say that it ’ s a myth—that welsh students are disadvantaged in any way by taking this qualification . sorry , andrew .",15,0.5,0.43472686409950256
0,0,okay .,15,0.5,0.44028568267822266
0,0,"could i just add to that response ? there are , obviously , differences in the way that universities treat the skills challenge certificate and the welsh baccalaureate , which is the prime focus of this . the attitude of the universities has changed significantly since that was a graded qualification .",15,0.5,0.49608999490737915
0,0,"yes , that has made a difference .",15,0.5,0.31146734952926636
0,0,"and even those who do not make it part of their offer consider it exceedingly valuable in the way that young people are prepared to go to university and , therefore , as part of their personal statement , as part of their interview , the activity that the young person has taken by means of the skills challenge certificate is definitely recognised , even by those who don ’ t actually make it part of their offer . so , we ’ re still on a journey—that graded qualification has only been taught for a couple of years , but the journey is taking us to the right place , towards the right destination .",15,0.5,0.3390396535396576
0,0,"okay . so , it isn ’ t just about variable admissions practices across universities ; it is to deal with the skills challenge certificate as well , which needed changing in order to improve that .",15,0.5,0.4892972409725189
0,0,"but that was changed in september 2015. when it was a 'yes'/'no ' qualification , i think they held it in less regard than they do now that it is a graded qualification .",15,0.5,0.37456923723220825

0,0,"we will need to continue to communicate to all audiences the importance of this and the value of this qualification . but i am confident that the university sector , in its wide variety of forms , regards the welsh baccalaureate qualification as a valuable endeavour for welsh students to undertake , and they certainly don ’ t regard it as a detriment to students .",15,0.5,0.46826061606407166

0,0,"yes , just that the committee , of course , has been trying to gain evidence on this sector from the universities themselves , but universities wales , which represents the interests of universities in wales , has rejected the committee 's invitation to submit any oral or written evidence . so , can you see the dilemma we 're in ? we are hearing a few things coming from some universities , we hear what you 're saying , but we ca n't get to the root of the matter because the universities themselves are n't willing to come to speak to us . are you also disappointed that they have rejected our invitation to come and speak to us ?",15,0.5,0.33905449509620667
0,0,"where 's the enthusiasm , chair ? where 's the enthusiasm ?",15,0.5,0.45355889201164246
0,0,and perhaps that 's a sign that they do n't want to be drawn into this argument between the government and us as a committee .,15,0.5,0.29548880457878113
1,0,"well , it ’ s a matter for individual universities to decide whether they want to participate in the work of this committee . i would urge them to do so . all welsh universities regard the welsh baccalaureate as an equivalent to a-level , and all universities use it as part of their offer—welsh universities .",15,0.5,0.555905282497406
0,0,"yes , but you see what our dilemma is , though , because if we can ’ t actually ask them directly , it 's a bit difficult for us to actually probe this and to help move things on ? anyway , i 'll leave it at that . thank you .",15,0.5,0.40305718779563904
0,0,"well , it 's a matter for them , and maybe the chair would like to take that up with universities wales .",15,0.5,0.3029380440711975
1,0,we have had quite an extensive dialogue with them about it . suzy on seren .,15,0.5,0.5308879613876343
0,0,"so , just briefly , you ’ ve said several times that having a welsh bac qualification is an advantage and certainly no detriment , and that it ’ s valued by universities . but advantage isn't the same as equivalence , and we have had evidence from—i think it was cardiff university , again , where they had students with two a-levels and a bac who were actually performing as weaker students . so , even though on the face of it you 've got three a-levels , those particular students are n't matching up to the expectations of a student with three a-levels . i do want to challenge what you said about the students who are involved in the seren network about the baccalaureate being accepted for things like veterinary medicine and medicine itself . we 've had evidence from fe colleges , which are now significant players in producing our seren-style students , if you like , that they are exempting their students from doing the bac because it 's a distraction , effectively . what 's your comment on that ? because if this is a question of communication , which i suspect you 're about to tell me , one of the axioms of good communication is you can have the best marketing in the world , but if the product you 're selling is n't highly valued then you 're actually just doubling the problem . so , can you explain to me why fe is exempting their highest flyers from doing the bac ?",15,0.5,0.35555604100227356
0,0,"i think sometimes colleges make the decision that four or five a-levels is of an advantage , and therefore , if you 're asking students to carry that workload , which is a considerable workload , that 's the preferred route for more able and talented students . again , what is quite clear in all the conversations that i have had with russell group universities , including oxford and cambridge , is that this is a myth . what universities tell me they want is not necessarily students with four or five a-levels ; they want students with three really exceptional grades at a-level and a welsh baccalaureate . i think that 's really , really an important message to get across—that it is not necessary to do four or five a-levels if you aspire to go to these russell group universities , or if you decide you want to apply to oxford and cambridge . as i said , in the conversations that we have had—and there is actually some research , and i will let the committee have links to the research . there is some research to suggest that those students who have been involved in project-based work—and , of course , that 's not just the welsh baccalaureate , that would be the epq , which is a qualification that is rapidly gaining traction in england . that is an extended project—research based—qualification , very similar to the individual project element of the welsh baccalaureate . the epq in england is seen as a qualification taken by more able and talented students , and what we see in some of the research that is coming forward is that those students who have engaged in that type of work , project-based work , individual-led , research-based work—those skills are the skills that are really attuned to the nature of university-type work . therefore , that is valued by universities and there is some indication to say that there is a correlation between the students who have undertaken that work and their potential success at undergraduate level . they also tell me that there is a link between , for instance , being able then to use those skills to gain work experience , placements and internships in the private sector and in the world of work , because , as i said , those types of skills are really , really valuable and therefore that 's why they value the qualification .",15,0.5,0.40795662999153137
0,0,"can i just add— ? it 's great that they 're telling you , why are n't they telling fe ?",15,0.5,0.4752667248249054
0,0,"well , as i said , i think it 's really important that fe colleges understand that there is a myth around the fact that these universities are looking for four or five a-levels , and if that 's the reason why then colleges are not allowing students or dissuading students from taking the welsh bac , i think we need to reflect on what 's important to those universities—which is the right a-levels . i think it 's really , really important that students are given the best advice about the a-levels they need to take , facilitating subjects to get into a university , and the value of the skills and knowledge they will acquire through the welsh bac as an assistance to them going forward .",15,0.5,0.29074615240097046

0,0,"actually , it 's your set of questions next on universal adoption .",15,0.5,0.4880695939064026
1,0,"i 'll try and keep this on the shorter side , if that 's okay , everybody . you say in your evidence that you expect universal adoption , basically , by 2020 , i think it is , or it might be 2019. what do you think universal adoption actually means ? what does it look like ? does it mean 100 per cent adoption ?",15,0.5,0.5890673995018005
0,0,"what is means is that i expect all institutions to be in a position to deliver the welsh baccalaureate . i believe it should be an entitlement to all welsh students to be able to study this qualification , and i believe we should work to the situation where it becomes the norm to take the welsh baccalaureate . i also recognise that in some individual cases , there may be very good reasons why perhaps this is not aligned to the well-being of that particular student . but when i talk about universal adoption , i expect all our institutions to be in a position to deliver the qualification , and i believe it should be an entitlement for welsh students to be able to undertake this qualification .",15,0.5,0.4299626350402832
0,0,but not an obligation—that 's the bit i 'm trying to get at .,15,0.5,0.4611711800098419
0,0,"i think it should become the norm , and if there are exceptions to that , and there could well be for very legitimate reasons , i think that that flexibility should be allowed . but i think , for those students who are not doing that welsh baccalaureate , there should be evidence as to why that decision has been taken .",15,0.5,0.35311856865882874
0,0,"okay , so there 's a presumption . i think the performance measures , probably , are likely to sharpen the minds of some school leaders , so i won't pursue that . but can you tell me what lesson you may have learnt from the universal obligation for students to study welsh language in schools when those schools were n't particularly ready to offer a quality course ?",15,0.5,0.37440094351768494
0,0,"as we 've rehearsed earlier , it is important that all of our schools and colleges are in a position to deliver this qualification well and deliver a really positive experience to learners . that 's why there is existing support available , and via our new professional learning programmes there will be more support available for teachers to ensure that they have the skills and the confidence to deliver the qualification in a high-quality manner .",15,0.5,0.3765680193901062
0,0,"okay . well , that 's going to take some time . would you consider pausing the presumption of universal roll-out until you 're absolutely sure that all institutions are able to offer the bac to the quality that you would like to see it delivered ?",15,0.5,0.34296903014183044
0,0,not at this stage . i have no intention of pausing . we have evidence that schools are already delivering the qualification really well—,15,0.5,0.3362478017807007

0,0,"okay . well , i agree with you on that , actually , which is why i was a bit confused when you had some in-year additional money in this year 's budget that was being given out to consortia rather than to schools to improve the ability of their teachers to deliver the welsh baccalaureate in certain schools . can you tell me whether the money—i think it was about £5 million that was going to the consortia in-year—will you will offer them suggestions that that is used for improving baccalaureate teaching ?",15,0.5,0.3061694800853729

1,0,"well , of course , there are some consequentials that are coming to the welsh government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks . that funding , of course , is less than we had anticipated , and that reflects , actually , a success story because industry is reformulating , and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease , which is a good thing . but to your question : should we use the funding ? well , of course we should use funding . i 'm not personally in favour of hypothecation , i think i 'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource . there are , of course , a number of initiatives that we currently fund through the general revenue . and when i think about obesity , i do n't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source , but i think about the totality of the £7 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general , and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular .",15,0.5,0.5135254859924316

0,0,"well , that cuts to what i was talking about . my preference—it 's a personal view—is that hypothecation does n't really help us too much . i mean , what we need to look at is whether the programmes , the sorts of programmes that are being funded in england , or indeed in scotland , are working effectively , and if they are , are they being delivered here in wales ? we have looked very carefully at the plans that england and scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight , and we 've made a comparison with what we 're doing in wales , and our ambition in wales is to go further than those nations , in many ways . but i come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system , indeed , about how much money , overall , are we putting into prevention .",15,0.5,0.4720551073551178

1,0,"no , i have not been given a date . what i have done today is publish the principles that will aid me in , as you said , me making a decision . so , clearly , we will be relying on the advice of our medical and scientific advisers , but the principles are very clear . firstly , we will need to consider any decision to have more children returning to school in the context of the safety and the physical and the emotional well-being of children and young people and the staff . obviously , i ca n't make a decision regarding education in isolation . it will have to be taken in the context of the wider welsh government response to dealing with this pandemic . thirdly , it is absolutely crucial in making any decisions that we have clearly communicated that to parents and to staff , on the information that we have used to reach any decisions , to build confidence for parents and professionals , but also to give them time to plan . it will be impossible to move quickly to new ways of working . and we also have to look at—and it 's been paraphrased quite a lot today—if we are looking at certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting , which groups they should be . and , finally , how do we operationalise that ? how do we make those settings as safe as they possibly can be , and how do we tackle some of the difficult challenges of everything from ensuring that we have adequate numbers of workforce available , to the very real questions about how you would do social distancing in the context of education , school transport issues , how you would avoid people gathering at the school gate , for instance ? so , there are very practical issues that would need to be considered and thought through very , very carefully before we could return , before what we could see is a move from where we are now to the next phase of education , and new approaches to what schooling may look like . but , again , i must be absolutely clear to you , members of the committee , and to people watching : it is not feasible , in this sense , that we would move from where we are now to what all of us would regard as normal education and what the operation of schools looked like before the start of this pandemic .",15,0.5,0.5179890394210815
0,0,"so , what is clear from what you 've said is that it 's going to be phased return . i would assume that would be the most vulnerable—perhaps additional learning needs pupils would return first . just reading some of the things that you 've said today , can you answer that question ? and can i also ask : you said that guiding principle no . 3 will be having the confidence of parents , staff and students , based on evidence and information , so they can plan ahead . what will that evidence and information be , and how will you know that you 've got the confidence of parents to return ?",15,0.5,0.28252479434013367

0,0,"thank you , chair . just following on from your answer to siân gwenllian earlier about the number of vulnerable children in school , what 's being done specifically to facilitate more of those children coming into a school setting or hub at the moment ? i 'm thinking about the 600 you 've talked about , and i know , in one of my local authority areas of merthyr , which is a very small authority , we 're talking about the number of children identified as vulnerable running into thousands , not hundreds , and that 's just in one authority . so , this is a particularly difficult issue to address , i appreciate , but how are we going to get more of these children into the hubs ?",15,0.5,0.4593460261821747
0,0,"okay , dawn . the first thing to say is that the issue of vulnerable children attending settings is one that is a challenge to not just wales , but also to my colleagues in northern ireland , scotland and england . i 'm pleased to say that we are working across government departments—myself , obviously , and colleagues in education—with colleagues in social services to have a cross-government approach to these issues . i think the first thing to say is that these are complex messages , because the overriding public health message from our government has been to stay at home and children should be kept at home as much as possible , and to make sure that our hubs run smoothly , safely and effectively , we do need to limit the number of children who are attending those hubs . so , firstly , the fact that numbers are small is in some ways a success of our public health messages , because parents have been heeding those messages , but , of course , all of us will have concerns for some children who remain at home . so , i 'm pleased to say that we have seen a doubling in the last week of the number of children . so , although numbers are small , they have doubled over the course of the last week . we 're working with local authorities and they have assured us that children and young people with a social worker have been risk assessed on a multi-agency basis and are receiving support in a number of ways , and that includes having conversations about some of those children attending the hubs . they 're also looking to support in other ways . of course , some of our children who would be classed as vulnerable—and our definition of 'vulnerable ' is one that is shared between the systems in england and wales—could be children with a statement of special educational needs . for some of those children who , perhaps , have very intense health needs , actually , staying at home is the appropriate thing for that child and that family to do , and we 're looking to support families , and local authorities and local education systems are looking to support families , in a number of ways . we also know that just because you do n't have a social worker or a statement of special educational needs does not mean that a child may not be vulnerable , and schools are very aware of the needs of those children and have been carrying out regular telephone check-ins where they can—if the age of the child is appropriate—just to keep in touch with those families and those individual children . but we will continue to work across government to encourage , where it is appropriate , children to attend settings , and , if it is not appropriate for children to be in a setting , that there is contact with those children and young people to ensure that they remain , and their families remain , supported .",15,0.5,0.254442423582077
0,0,"thank you , minister . it 's encouraging to hear you talk about the ongoing safeguarding of children that are at home and i assume , within that , appropriate referral mechanisms are still in place if teachers or anybody has any particular concern about a child . similarly , with special educational needs , whereas some of those children benefit clearly from a one-to-one provision in a school , and they may not respond as well to remote working , or remote contact , with an sen advisor , are you considering in any way any relaxation of the lockdown rule in particular for those children in terms of them being able to access the support that they need for their particular educational needs ?",15,0.5,0.3606708347797394
0,0,"well , first of all , dawn , you 're absolutely right : my expectation is that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children , and schools should continue to refer children to children 's services if they have any concerns , and that would also , of course , be the case for youth workers who may be keeping in contact with children . so , there is a professional expectation on all those that are working with our children and young people that , despite the circumstances they find themselves in , they should continue to report and refer cases if they see anything or hear or are told anything that makes them concerned about a child 's welfare and safety . with regard to children with additional learning needs , i am aware that that can present a number of challenges to families and children , and perhaps steve davies could give some further details . we have been keen to work with local authorities to ensure specialist provision , where that is appropriate—so , if i could give you an example of my own local authority in powys , they have two specialist centres available for children with more profound additional learning needs , and those centres are available—recognising , however , that , even with the provision of specialist hubs , it can be a challenge for some children with additional learning needs to find themselves outside of a routine . hubs are often staffed on a rota basis and therefore children could be faced with staff that they are unfamiliar with . so , even when local authorities—and the vast , vast majority of them do—have specialist services in place , sometimes that might not be the best thing for a child 's health and well-being . but perhaps steve can give us further details of the conversations that have been taking place with directors of education to ensure that children with additional learning needs have access to the hubs and specialist support . steve .",15,0.5,0.3265913128852844

0,0,"thank you . just two more questions . one is around emotional and mental health difficulties being experienced by children and young people at the moment . now , there was a very welcome announcement of £1.25 million pounds for school counselling . how is that , in practical terms , being applied if those children are not actually in school ?",15,0.5,0.44075217843055725
0,0,"you 're right , dawn : we have to consider how we can support children not only in their learning during this time , but also to recognise the very real impact that the pandemic will have on all of our mental health and well-being—recognising , of course , it is absolutely natural for all of us , including children and young people , to have fears and anxieties at this time . that 's a natural reaction to the situation that we find ourselves in . but , of course , there are issues around those children that would have currently been receiving school counselling , and also being able to be in a position to respond to a potential growth in the number of children that are receiving support . so , the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families . in the immediacy , of course , that will have to be done in different ways than perhaps we 've traditionally delivered services in the past , because of social distancing and lockdown rules , but we want to get some of these systems in place now , rather than waiting for everything to go back to normal . we need to be able to plan to offer services in the here and now , but also be able to plan for what potentially could be an increase in the demand of those services . so , we 've been in close touch with local authorities , asking them what they believe that they will need and how they can use additional financial resources , and we 've been very pleased to be able to secure that for them .",15,0.5,0.27315738797187805
0,0,"so , that would include things like telephone and video support as well , i guess , then .",15,0.5,0.35009774565696716
0,0,"yes , absolutely . so , that would include remote counselling as in a fashion that we 're doing now , but also , as and when some of the restrictions are perhaps removed , looking at an enhanced family therapy , or a therapy approach . so , when we talk about counselling , i think it 's important to recognise that there will be some flexibility around this money and it does not necessarily mean that local authorities have to use it on a one-to-one basis . that might not be appropriate for some children , especially our younger children and their families , and they can use that money to provide counselling or therapy—in the widest possible terms—that is the best method to support individual children and their families . but , clearly , we 're having to do that in the confines of lockdown and social distancing at the moment . some of that money can also be used to support the professional learning and the professional development of counsellors , because , of course , they may be being asked to work in a different way and we need to make sure that they have the appropriate skills and abilities to do that .",15,0.5,0.22651588916778564

0,0,"suzy , what i believe that we 're seeing in our schools is new pupils coming into school . so , there has been , i know , a real effort on behalf of educationalists and social services staff to really reach out to families and to make sure that they 're aware of the support that is available out there for them and their children , and to be able to give them the confidence that there are—that the hubs are available for them . so , we have seen an increase in children . those numbers are still small and , i believe , potentially , there is an opportunity to build on that and to have further conversations with families about the support that is available for vulnerable children , whether that— . that vulnerability , of course , can cover a whole range of issues . as i said when we last met , this is a constantly evolving situation . the initial response—local authorities and schools worked incredibly fast and incredibly quickly to set up these hubs . we 've seen an evolution in the weeks since that time and i am sure that we will continue to see some evolution in approaches .",15,0.5,0.29294538497924805

0,0,"okay , thank you . dawn , final question , please .",15,0.5,0.22904402017593384
0,0,"yes , my last question is really about the potential for the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers . is that a concern for you ? i 'm thinking particularly in relation to those less affluent families in having access to technology and so on . what kind of concerns do you have about that and what are we looking to do to try to ensure that that does n't actually play out ?",15,0.5,0.36241185665130615
0,0,"thank you , dawn . all of the statistics would tell us that learning loss and the gap , potentially , will affect those more vulnerable children the most . clearly , we will want to consider that as we think about what the new normal for education may look like , or as we develop into future phases . depending on where that child is in their educational journey , of course , the needs and the potential for loss are slightly different . so , for instance , when we 're thinking about very young children , we could be thinking about a lack of social interaction and the development of oracy skills . of course , that , potentially , then will have a knock-on to their ability to learn to read and then to write , for instance . for other children who are , perhaps , older and heading towards formal examinations , the challenge when they return to school will be a slightly different one . i 'm not sure , chair , whether you want me to give some further details about our continuity-of-learning plan and how we are looking to address digital disadvantage now , or whether there are questions later .",15,0.5,0.26918062567710876
0,0,"well , i 've got a question on that coming up , so , if it 's okay , dawn , we 'll go on to that now . before we do that , i was just going to ask how the welsh government is paying due regard to the united nations convention on the rights of the child and , obviously , the right children and young people have to an education . i was going to ask you about the risk of inequality due to varying access to digital resources , which are so important in ensuring continuity of learning .",15,0.5,0.42626696825027466
1,0,"you 're absolutely correct , chair . officials are very aware of our responsibilities towards children 's rights in this regard and we are doing whatever we can to ensure that children have an equal opportunity and have equal access to learning at this time . we are fortunate in the regard that , because of previous decisions and investments , we have a strong base on which to build because we have our hwb digital learning platform and because we have invested heavily in the national purchasing of microsoft office and google for education tools , which are available to all families . we have become the first , i think—we 're certainly the first in the uk , and i 'm not sure whether we 're the first across the world , but i think we probably are—to deploy , for instance , adobe spark nationally . but , obviously , access to hardware and connectivity is crucial at this time . officials are working with local authorities to ensure that all children have access to both the hardware and the connectivity they need to be able to participate in digital learning at this particular time .",15,0.5,0.5697469711303711

0,0,"yes , absolutely . so , i 'm hoping to make an announcement tomorrow , if not later on this week , about some specific details around support for hardware and connectivity . we 're working closely with local authorities to understand just that : to understand from the schools the number of schools that—and a number of them have already done this—have been lending chromebooks , ipads and laptops to children , and also identifying children who are not perhaps engaging in the activities that have been made available . and we 'll be doing two things to support local authorities . the first is to use the stock of equipment that they already have to be able to provide hardware to students . so , we have purchased on a national basis software that , when applied to an old piece of kit , essentially turns it into an out-of-the-box chromebook . because , as you can imagine , just like other things during a pandemic , there has been a rush to buy new stuff on the market and then there is a scramble and nobody can get what they need . so , we 're utilisng kit that is already available in schools and local authorities , and we will look to backfill that to schools at a later point out of our edtech investment programme . the other issue is , once a child has a chromebook or a laptop or a device , issues around connectivity . so , we 're also looking to purchase on a national level and distribute mi-fi connectivity , so students will be able to have access to wi-fi where they do n't have that already . that 's why we need to work closely with local authorities and schools to identify the level of that need and to make sure the stuff gets to the right children . one of the ways in which we are able to do that is to look at engagement in education . so , if a child has n't been engaging , is that because they just do n't want to and they 're voting with their feet—but clearly teachers need to have a conversation about that—or is that because the child simply does not have the ability to do that , and therefore we need to get that stuff out to those children ? so , rather than just simply leaving it to local authorities to scramble around in a very crowded market to get the stuff that they will need , we 're trying to do that on a national basis and deploy that to local authorities . so , our officials have been having conversations with each of our local authorities to ascertain what 's already happened , and there is very good practice out there—schools have been proactive—but where there are gaps , what can we do as a national government to be able to assist them to do that ? we are repurposing some of the resources that we had previously identified for our edtech investment , using those resources to fill this particular gap .",15,0.5,0.3108707070350647

0,0,"i think my questions are first , but , michelle , please do correct me if you were planning to come in before . the pdg for looked-after children does n't quite seem to have the degree of visibility as the pdg for the free-school-meals . i think we had the mori/wiserd survey—only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary schools were aware that pdg was targeted at looked-after children . i just wonder—can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with pdg for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia in this field ?",15,0.5,0.3524948060512543
0,0,"okay . i think it is absolutely fair to say that most awareness around pdg is around free school meals . there is less awareness around the availability of pdg to support looked-after children . i think that 's probably in the nature of the cohort , so , there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after . so , i think that 's part of the explanation . a decision was taken in 2015 to regionalise pdg for looked-after children . my understanding was that the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it was being used previously . so , looked-after pdg is held at a regional level . we have looked-after children pdg co-ordinators—they 're in their second year this year—to look at a regional deployment of that resource . and that resource can be done in a variety of ways , through individual allocation to a school to support an individual child , through to capacity building for the whole system . so , for instance , if i give you an example , in carmarthenshire , there 's been a big emphasis on attachment disorder and training teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder . carmarthenshire happens to be one of those local authorities that does quite well in terms of attainment for looked-after children . but , clearly , i have—not concerns . 'concerns ' is n't the right word . but i have asked officials to give greater scrutiny to how that resource has been used in the last year . steve , on my behalf , wrote out to the system , setting out our expectations , but also advising them of the fact we will be asking very detailed questions of accountability for that money . so , what has that money been used on and how can you account for the effect ? but , steve , maybe you can give some greater detail .",15,0.5,0.32475438714027405
0,0,"i think the challenge that— . one of the rationales for shifting—not that all the money stays in the region , but having a regional strategic support—was that , historically , the money was going directly with that child to the school . given the quite often rapid turnover of children in schools—the very nature of looked-after children is they do sometimes move through foster parents—historically , what happened , the money lands in the school , because , at that time in the year , when it 's measured , the school gets the money and can spend it on some additional support for staff , but quite often that child moves on to another school and the money does n't transfer . some schools will go through quite a number of years without having a looked-after child and will not think strategically , 'how do i need to support them ? ' so , that was the rationale of the shift . in terms of the implementation of the regional allocation , as of this financial year finishing , we are going into local authorities and regions to evaluate where they 've located the resource , what the impact of that resource has been , so that is reinforced and shared more widely .",15,0.5,0.36538606882095337

' , but then there 's also a tension about how can you create some flexibility around the school 's usage of the grant . so , we will look at that . i think there is the issue of where a school would know of a child that was looked after . issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive , because we could n't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child . so , a family may be very open and very keen to explain that to a school , but we ca n't necessarily track as closely children who have been adopted , especially if that adoption happens before the child goes to school . we ca n't be in a position of forcing families to disclose this information if they do n't want to , but we certainly can , as i say , look to strengthen our monitoring arrangements around pdg support for looked-after children and the impact that that 's having . i just think we need to be a bit mindful of people 's privacy in some instances . if they do n't want to divulge that , it would n't be my job to tell a family , 'you have to let us know if your child is adopted .

0,0,"i 'm a great believer in if we can get it right for our most vulnerable learners , we 'll be getting it right for all of our learners . i gave the example earlier , for instance , of attachment disorder , and , chair , you will know that i have had conversations . one of the emerging themes for me , as i go around visiting schools , is the impact and the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder , and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children . so , for instance , as i said about carmarthenshire , there 's been a huge effort to address that in the school sector in carmarthenshire . now , that has a disproportionate benefit for those children , because you 're more likely to see attachment disorder in children who are care experienced , because of the nature of the lives that those children have lived , but that does n't necessarily mean that attachment disorder is exclusively found in those children that are looked after . it can be found in other families as well . so , that vulnerable learner , regardless of their background , will benefit from having teachers who are better trained , understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need .",15,0.5,0.28272658586502075

1,0,"okay . mark , did you have anything you wanted to ask ?",15,0.5,0.5858977437019348
0,0,"yes . can i follow up on tracking adopted children ? i entirely understand that you ca n't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted . however , my understanding was that , in england , there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that i 'm not clear is happening in wales and how , if at all , that links to the pupil level annual school census data . perhaps sort of linked to that , is n't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools , potentially , with adopted children more aware that adopted children who were previously looked after have this potential grant , and would they not be more willing to disclose this , at least confidentially to the school and government , if they knew there was this upside of doing so ?",15,0.5,0.4065743684768677
0,0,"we 're actively looking at whether we should try and find a way of collecting this data , with the caveats that i just gave earlier . we ca n't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them , nor would i want to . but there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether we could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through . you 're absolutely right . one of the ways in which we can often encourage take-up , for instance , of free school meals , especially in those communities where there is a sense of reluctance to apply for support—even though people are entitled to it , there 's a reluctance to do it ; sometimes we see this in rural areas— . actually , appealing to the parents by saying , 'actually , this will mean more money for your child 's school budget' is a much more compelling reason why people will apply for it then saying , 'actually , it 's going to help you ' , because they do n't want to be seen being dependent , they do n't want to be seen being helped . but , if you say to them , 'actually , do you know that this means more money for your child 's school ? ' , they go , 'oh , all right then , i 'll fill in the forms now . ' so , you 're right , i think there is something that we could do to make parents understand , in the round , that this has an impact . but we are actively looking at and discussing whether we could create a dataset around adopted children and how we can do that in line with data protection and data sharing . one of the things i am concerned about in the performance of looked-after children generally is how we can , across government , work more closely together . we ca n't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education . it 's got to be a job of social services and the health service as well . there 's got to be a joined-up approach to doing that . now , officials were at the ministerial advisory group that 's chaired by david melding on prospects for looked-after children . they were there at the group last week . david tells me that the paper was very positively received by the group . i will be sitting down with david melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side . i think there 's really an appetite between me and the minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this . we ca n't expect schools to do it on their own and alone . and there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes . it 's not just about the pdg ; it is about , when social services are thinking about a placement , where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school—when does that take place ? do we talk about the placement , move a child and then think , 'oh my goodness me , what are we going to do about the schooling ? ' if you can imagine , the school could have been working really , really hard with a pupil to get them in a good place , to get them being able to access the curriculum , and then social services decide that the placement is being changed . so , we potentially lose all of that . so , a greater involvement in education and better linked-up working in local authorities will help us with this . it ca n't be just the job of the pdg . if we think we can crack this with just pdg , then we 're being delusional . it has to be a cross-government approach at a national level , and at a local government level as well , to get this right . sometimes , data protection—how can we break down some of these barriers between , you know , the school does n't need to , schools should n't see , the entire social services report ? well , maybe the school does need to see some of that background information if they 're going to have an impact for that child . so , there 's more work to do , but it can not be just the job of education on its own if we 're going to make a difference , nor can it just be the job of the pdg to make a difference for those children .",15,0.5,0.302249938249588

0,0,"yes , before i go on to those , i just wanted to support , really , what mark was saying about adopted children and how important it is , i think , that the adoptive parents feel able to speak to the school and to give information . because certainly any evidence we 've had from adoptive parents , and generally knowing about what adoptive parents do feel , is that they often feel that there 's a degree of a lack of sensitivity in the school about the issues of adoption . i would certainly support some move towards ensuring that the atmosphere was open in a way that would encourage them to realise that it would be a help for the children if there was an awareness in the school . so , i just wanted to really reinforce that .",15,0.5,0.39053744077682495

0,0,"yes , you 're right . we need to make sure that those parents feel that they can discuss this with school leaders and classroom teachers and explore how best those individual children can be supported , and how best we can support parents . because , again—and i 've said this a lot—after the quality of teaching , the second biggest impact on a child 's educational outcome will be parental engagement . so , being able to create an environment where adoptive parents feel very confident and able to talk about their children 's education is absolutely crucial if we 're going to get that parental engagement that we need for all of our children .",15,0.5,0.3027065694332123

0,0,"well , there 's no getting away from it : the way in which we currently measure outcomes for looked-after children , the results are not good enough . it 's a source of huge concern to me that we need to do better for those children . that 's why officials are engaging with the group that david melding is chairing , to make sure that education is integral to that group and it 's not lost sight of . there 's a discussion to be had about the cohort , whether it 's right and correct to compare looked-after children to the main cohort , or whether these statistics are useful in any way . sometimes as well—this is not to make an excuse because , as i 've said in my paper , it 's extremely disappointing , but sometimes it can be really difficult . because the cohort sometimes can be very , very small , it can swing the statistics to look perhaps more dramatic .",15,0.5,0.4332892596721649

0,0,"we can look at exclusions . we also have to read across about how the whole system works , not just the pdg element of the system . so , we know , for example , that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need , so we ca n't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding ; we have to look at it at a wider level of support . so , given that the majority of those children will have an aln , how can we make sure that our new aln legislation and our new aln regime meets the needs of these children ? so , i think what we 're looking at , again , is to say that it ca n't be just the job of the pdg . that 's there as an additional level of support , but actually , we 've got to get our aln right . unless we get our aln right , lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in , day out via that system . we do know that sometimes , if we 're not addressing aln , then we 're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance . so , we 've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting , that are not just as a result of the fact that they 're looked after ; they have other needs as well .",15,0.5,0.2845872938632965

0,1,"thank you , chair . you touched on this once or twice in answers to questions about how rigorous the qualification is . we 've had mixed evidence , i would suggest , from groups of stakeholders . we 've heard people say that the welsh bac has no rigour , that pupils are spoon-fed . we 've heard that the welsh bac is passively marked , the grades are inflated , that there 's little rigour in the sampling and moderation , there 's a confusion about how the scc is graded , and i know that 's something you talked about , actually , that introducing the grading system is improving the rigour . i suppose my question to you is : if the welsh bac is being seen in this way by stakeholders , how are going to address that ? to what extent is that a real problem ?",15,0.5,0.44133803248405457
0,0,"i think making it a graded qualification has been really important , and i make no apologies for this qualification being rigorous—no apologies for that at all . that 's how it should be , and that 's how you create value , by ensuring that a qualification is rigorous . what 's really important is that it 's not just me saying that it 's rigorous ; there is an independent process that benchmarks qualifications . the fact is that at advanced level—because i do n't know if you 're making these observations about the pre-16 welsh bac , or whether we 're talking about the advanced level qualification—that is the equivalent of an a-level . it 's been benchmarked against a-levels . it has a ucas tariff associated with it . it is used by universities as a means of qualification that gains entrance into a university in just the same way as an a-level is . so , therefore , i do n't have any concerns about the rigour of the qualification . in terms of spoon-feeding , one of the reasons why universities like the qualification is that it 's very difficult , for instance , in the individual project work to be spoon-fed . it is very demanding of individual students , and it 's very difficult in a way . that 's one of the reasons why it 's valuable , is n't it , because it teaches a different set of skills ? because if you 're doing a traditional , say , history a-level or a science a-level , there 's a very strict syllabus and a course , there 's a textbook and people are taught to that particular syllabus ; with the welsh bac , it is individual students that have to think , for instance , of their own individual project . you ca n't get those off a shelf , and you ca n't necessarily just find that information easily . there 's real skill involved in being able to do that well and get graded well for that . so , i do not have concerns about the rigour . i do have concerns about some of the feedback by qualifications wales about the onerousness of the evaluation and what that means for teacher workload , which is one of the things that qualifications wales is looking at . but in terms of rigour and people being spoon-fed , then i do n't share those concerns .",15,0.5,0.3934738337993622
0,0,"okay , because those were concerns , in the main , that were articulated by people delivering the welsh bac—by teachers . so , i suppose the question then comes back to some of the other points that were being raised about the consistency , because that may well be from those teachers in schools where they 're not taking the bac as seriously as some others are .",15,0.5,0.4698983430862427

0,1,okay . pupils ' confidence in their school 's ability to help them with their emotional and mental well-being is much less at secondary school and that 's been a consistent theme as well from your reports . why do you think that is ?,15,0.5,0.28319525718688965
0,0,"yes , you 're right . as we mentioned earlier , we do pupil surveys before all our inspections , and across a number of those indicators , like , 'how well does the school listen ? do adults in school care about me ? how well does the school deal with bullying ? '—quite a lot those ones around well-being do tail off . nine out of 10 pupils at key stage 2 have that confidence , down to half at key stage 4 , as you say . and i think there are a number of factors that we think contribute to that : i think one of the factors is that pupils face , sometimes , more challenges as they get older in those teenage years , but they also become more reflective and perhaps more discerning . and i think what we find in secondary schools is perhaps secondary school pupils notice sometimes the differences between their everyday life that they experience in school and perhaps the messages that they 're getting about well-being in terms of their lessons , in terms of assemblies and in terms of school policies and so on . so , they are probably more discerning in noticing those differences and maybe there are some of those differences also there in primary school , but the pupils do n't notice . i think we 've already touched upon things like the differences in the way that , at primary school , you would tend to have a go-to adult , which is your teacher . the best secondary schools find ways to make sure that pupils do feel that level of support and feel there are trusted people , but it 's more of a challenge to make sure that that happens , because of the way they 're operating . we still have some concerns about personal and social education and the health and well-being support , which we 've made a recommendation about in the past in some of our thematic reports , but also recently in some of our secondary school inspection reports . and i think i already touched upon the fact that sometimes , when the budget is tight , it can be some of those—they 're not peripheral in their importance , but they 're not the teacher in the classroom : well-being support assistants and so on and family liaison workers—staff in the school who perhaps really support that pastoral care that the school as a whole can provide—it may be that those are the roles that are less prevalent at times of less funding . so , i think there are some great members of staff doing a really good job , but perhaps they 're not those members of staff who can support teachers and support pupils in creating that kind of caring environment . maybe there a fewer of them around . so , i think there 's not an obvious answer and part of it is that they do become more discerning and perhaps more vocal in those responses generally , as they get older . so , you might have a truer reflection of opinions than perhaps— . and that might explain some of the difference with primary , where , generally , they 're quite positive about everything across most of the schools that we ask .",15,0.5,0.4402233958244324

0,0,"i think there 's an element that it 's more of a challenge for a secondary school to provide an effective set of support from that whole-staff awareness of some of the challenges . and one of the pieces of work we 've done recently is around adverse childhood experiences , and we have found that primary schools have taken that and embraced it . once you 've trained your staff , then they 've got that knowledge . they 're the ones who are working day to day with the schools . secondary schools have n't always taken a whole-school approach to that . they might have trained a set of staff . so , maybe not every member of staff has the same level of understanding , but also those staff are n't spending the same amount of time with pupils . so , in terms of getting to know pupils , picking up on signs that they may be struggling , or that there might be concerns—it 's much more of a challenge . you 've got to work a lot harder as a secondary school to make sure that staff have that knowledge and that you 've got the tracking systems that can put those different bits of information together to actually mean that you can target support where it 's needed .",15,0.5,0.29895681142807007

0,0,"yes , that is correct . so , our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure—which i think , if we 're honest , we have to acknowledge is what we 're looking at—we would expect school staff—well-being staff , for instance in school—to be doing check-ins—phone check-ins , potentially , or facetime check-ins , with students , just to keep in touch with them as we go forward . we 'll be looking to promote amongst young people a range of online facilities that are available—so , for instance , meic website—so , looking to use a variety of platforms . we do , of course , have the formal nhs counselling services . i 'm concerned , of course , that for some children their access to their counsellor is via their school . we know that , and we 're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists—online counselling tools that children already use because they do n't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor . they 're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue , as far as possible , those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered , and their worries . i think we have to remember that this is a really worrying time for children and young people . one of the reasons , again , that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible—and teachers have been working so hard to do that—is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we 've needed and wanted to maintain . children will have worries about their own health ; they 'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents ; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves . so , we need to understand , and i think we will also have to recognise , that this support will have to be ongoing once we 're back to normal , and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience . they are incredibly resilient , and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages . they are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands ' and things like that than even adults have been . so , they are incredibly resilient , but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them .",15,0.5,0.2840484380722046

0,0,"yes , it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken , but i have done so on the very , very clear and unambiguous advice from qualifications wales . i met with qualifications wales and the wjec yesterday . what was most important to them was that i made an early decision and i did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams . i was able to make an informal decision at that meeting , and then , of course , there is a formal process that we have to go through . that , now , allows qualifications wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision , and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work . we are trying , as far as we can , as i understand it , to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day , for instance . it might not be possible , because , of course , we 're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it , and those human beings could find themselves unwell . so , our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in august , but that has to be caveated by the fact that we 're dealing with difficult circumstances . but , the wjec and qualifications wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next .",15,0.5,0.3715566396713257

0,0,"okay , so , all exams are cancelled , but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade—i think that 's a distinction that people need to be aware of . that is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications , and they are points of movement in the education system . so , it 's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next , whether that be university , whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form , into a college , into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities . that 's why we have to focus on those children , because for them , it is absolutely critical that we do . we are at an advantage in wales , can i say ? because of the nature of our examination system , those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on . because we 've kept our as-levels , we have got that data . because we have a gcse system— . our year 11s , if they 're doing triple science , they 've already done 40 per cent of their paper , so we 're very fortunate . because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system , there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use , alongside , potentially , teacher evaluation of students as well . and i think that 's really important . we ’ re starting from a better base than simply having none of that externally-verified data . what will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications , and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within wales , and i know that qualifications wales are discussing with their counterparts across the uk a modulated system across the uk . so , actually , we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the uk . so , we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade . so , they can have real confidence .",15,0.5,0.43211060762405396

0,0,"yes . you raised two issues , i think . one , about the difference between primary and secondary : i think what i 'm saying there is i think the fact that the new curriculum is going to be brought in for all the years in primary , but it 's going to be phased in year by year for secondary is a recognition of that difference . in terms of funding , probably everyone in this room , and certainly me included , would like to see more money for the education system—any educationalist would like to see that . but , you know , that is a decision for local and central government to decide how much they can afford . i think there is an argument for saying that the funding has become more challenging for schools over time .",15,0.5,0.38364309072494507
0,0,"can i ask , just to keep it on track , are you finding that that 's having an impact on secondary schools particularly—their ability to make space to get their heads around the curriculum ?",15,0.5,0.37950050830841064
0,0,"i do n't think you can make that straightforward correlation . but if you do look at surpluses and reserves , they have been more or less constant for primary schools over a long period of time , but they have declined for secondary schools . so , i think there probably is an argument for saying that we need to look at the funding of secondary schools in particular because , overall , they 're in deficit now . so , i think there is an argument for looking at that . the other thing that 's worth saying about funding is that even a small decrease in real terms can be disproportionately time consuming to manage . so , you know , if you have a large school and you have to maybe make one member of staff redundant , it can have a real big effect on the morale in the school . but also the time it takes for the headteacher and the senior staff to make those decisions can take their eye off the educational ball because they 're looking at these financial and staffing issues .",15,0.5,0.27742278575897217

0,0,"obviously , the most important resource for the education system is the teachers . so , it is a concern that recruitment is getting more and more difficult and that targets for initial teacher training are not being hit . and we 're not seeing them hit , if i remember correctly , even in primary , let alone secondary . so , there is a challenge , and i think we 've got to look at this in the round . we 've got to make sure that we have both a long-term strategy and a shorter term strategy for this . so , long term , we 've got to make sure that education is an attractive option for young people and more mature people to want to go into . so , that is partly to do with workload and staff well-being . i think there 's a general acceptance now that that needs to be higher up on the agenda , that people need to take that seriously , and there 's work going on regarding the workload issue .",15,0.5,0.2384946644306183

0,0,"yes . i think it will have an effect , but i think it 'll have a positive effect . i think the new curriculum , one of the things about the new curriculum is that it re-professionalises the profession . it gives back agency and ownership to teachers . i think it 's really important . and one of the reasons why teaching maybe has n't been that attractive a profession is that teachers in the past have just been delivering a set curriculum , and now they 've got a much more creative part in deciding for themselves how to teach something and what to teach . so , i think that is a very important part of attracting intelligent people into the profession . there are short-term things we need to do , of course , as well . i think we need to have a much more varied set of routes into teaching , so i welcome some of the part-time open university courses , for example . so , there are lots of ways—we were talking about maybe converting people from primary into secondary , particularly in welsh-medium , where there 's a shortage . so , all those kinds of varied routes , i think , into teaching , are important as well .",15,0.5,0.32335561513900757

0,0,"well , it is of concern to us , of course . i hope that we will have an opportunity to talk about the positive aspects of the education system in wales , because there are a number of good things we can report also . the primary sector , the special sector , post-16—there are many sectors that are doing well , and i think a story that 's particularly positive this year is that we have seen pupil referral units improving . we have seen examples of excellent practice in that sector for the first time in many a year , and we 've also seen excellent practice in independent special schools , which is also a sector— . because these are two sectors where there are very , very vulnerable children in attendance . so , i think that 's very encouraging . but , you 're right , of course , the biggest concern for the system , i would say , is secondary schools , and that is an issue of leadership , and also of the quality of the teaching and learning . those are the recommendations that we make most often in our inspection reports . so , i believe that there is a need to find a long-term solution , as i mentioned previously , and also a short-term solution to this problem . in the long term , to improve the quality of teaching and learning—well , that ’ s the main aim of the new curriculum . so , i am confident that that strategy is the right strategy . it will take time , as we mentioned previously ; it will take longer in secondary schools , and that 's for a number of reasons , and i have discussed the challenges that are additional for secondary schools in previous annual reports . so , there are many reasons why secondary schools find it more difficult , possibly , than primary schools . the children themselves are older and they have greater challenges . life is more complicated for them , possibly . it ’ s more difficult to engage with the parents of older children than younger children , and that ’ s an important factor . that ’ s one of the reasons why i believe it ’ s important that we do have community schools that ensure that the parents are part of the school ’ s life and take an interest in the education of their children . we also know that qualifications take a very prominent role in secondary schools ’ mindsets , and , in some cases , perhaps excessively so . so , we need to ensure that those qualifications are reformed as a result of the reform of the curriculum , and , of course , qualifications wales is carrying out that work currently . and also , we need to change the measures that we use to measure the schools ’ successes . now , there is work ongoing on that as well . but there are all kinds of variations and differences between the primary and secondary sectors . in primary schools , for example , the greatest and most obvious difference , i would say , is that you ’ ve got one teacher who looks after a child for a whole year , and that teacher can identify the needs of the pupil very well over a period of time , getting to know the child and , possibly , the family very well . it ’ s much more complicated for secondary school to do that ; there have to be systems put in place for that . so , there are many long-term things that we need to respond to . but in the short term , what is important is that those schools that cause concern receive much more support , and that is why i am glad and do welcome what 's being piloted currently , which is a system of supporting these schools , the multi-agency approach , that is . so , that is something that we have been calling for for quite a long period of time and piloted ourselves a few years ago . so , i 'm very glad that we are doing this in secondary schools throughout wales . i believe there are about 12 schools that are in that pilot scheme .",15,0.5,0.3196846544742584
0,0,you said previously that it 's a cause of concern for you that these schools that are failing or underachieving are not identified early enough . are there signs that that 's improving ?,15,0.5,0.2813579738140106
0,0,"well , one of the things that 's very positive about this pilot scheme is that it 's not just the schools that are officially causing concern that are a part of the pilot scheme , that is , the schools that we have identified , through inspections , as needing to be put in a statutory category . so , there are schools involved in the pilot scheme that the authorities and the consortia have identified themselves as schools that are at risk of causing concern . i believe that it 's fair to say that we have not reached a point yet where we have a system of agreed criteria in relation to identifying these schools yet . i think that there has been initial work that has been commissioned or that is about to arrive in relation to that , and the types of measures you would expect us to take account of would be dissatisfaction from parents , staff leaving , a change in leadership . we use surveys with the children , for instance , and that gives you quite a good idea of whether a school is possibly facing difficulties . so , there 's not one single criteria alone that will tell you , 'this is a school that is at risk of causing concern ' , but taken together , having a set of criteria that everyone has agreed would be a good way of monitoring schools , i believe .",15,0.5,0.3991452753543854
0,0,"okay . well , we 'll be coming on to that middle tier later on , and perhaps that 's where the problem lies , namely that if there is n't an agreed system from consortia and yourselves , perhaps that 's where the focus needs to be .",15,0.5,0.29978495836257935

0,0,"well , how long does it take , therefore , for a school to move from an improvement category , in terms of special measures , to be escalated then ? because one sees sometimes that there 's an excellent school , and within five years ' time , it 's in the red . so , there 's a great deal of variance in that .",15,0.5,0.32019856572151184

0,0,"on average , secondary schools that are in need of special measures take just over two years , on average . some are shorter ; some are quite a considerable amount longer . it 's a little less for schools that go into significant improvement . with primary schools , of course , it 's much shorter because the issues are far less complex ; it 's easier to bring about improvements in teaching . when you 've got large numbers of staff , you 've got large secondary schools , it takes time to actually bring about those improvements , but it is a long time , just over two years , when you think that some pupils , maybe in key stage 4 for the two years— . certainly , we want to see schools coming out of category much quicker , and this is where the multi-agency approach certainly is a positive step . all partners involved in supporting the school are involved in these improvement boards . they focus on bringing about improvement in the areas of the school that are weakest , and it is the responsibility of everybody involved—that is : ourselves , the regions , local authorities , the schools themselves and their governing bodies—to look at how they can best support the school to bring about that improvement . so , it 's getting an agreement on what the issues are , and then planning the support so that we avoid duplication , but that we support the school in the areas they need more support . and we hope that this then will accelerate the improvement of the schools that find themselves in category . but , as meilyr already said , there are some schools involved in that particular pilot that are at danger of causing serious concern . so , the pilot is trying out those two different approaches as well .",15,0.5,0.36723822355270386
0,0,"okay , thank you . and just finally from me , for the time being at least , the financial situation ; we 've spoken about that already this morning . if you could— . if funding was injected into the system tomorrow , say , what would you spend it on ? what aspects would benefit from that additional funding ?",15,0.5,0.4568519592285156

0,0,yes . how would you use any additional funding that would flow into the school ?,15,0.5,0.3077101409435272
0,0,"it 's difficult to make that decision , because every school is different . it is important , of course , that leaders do have the power and the ability to make those decisions themselves . but , certainly , in the short term , the type of thing i would have thought would be to prepare for the new curriculum . that means freeing up teachers to think about what the new curriculum means to them . the schools that have been a part of developing the curriculum have been in a fortunate position in that they 've had plenty of time to think about this . so , it 's now time—and this was the chief message of my annual report this year—for every school in wales to start to think . because i think that the new curriculum is truly an opportunity to take a forward step in terms of how we teach and learn within schools . but that means that time is needed for schools to think this through and , in that thinking , to contact the community , to talk to their children as well , to see what the community in its broader sense would like to see being in the new curriculum , because it 's up to every school . although the new curriculum sets a framework , it is up to each and every school to decide what they 're going to teach , and what they 're teaching in order to prepare their young people for this new world that we have in the twenty-first century . therefore , to give you a somewhat superficial answer , i would be setting time aside for the training of teachers .",15,0.5,0.3277135491371155
0,0,"can i just add one thing there ? i think what we 've seen over the years recently is that local authorities , to some extent , have safeguarded the funding that goes to the schools , but the effect of that is that we 've seen less funding going into some of the local authority services ; for example , those services that support well-being , that promote attendance , and that perhaps support behaviour and assistance for schools . so , i think that all of those factors contribute to how schools can support and assist their pupils , and to improve themselves . so , i think that side of things is important as well—in the school or in the local authority , if funding is available , it should be allocated to all of those things so that those services can also support the children to succeed .",15,0.5,0.3167782425880432

0,0,"just before we move on to the middle tier , if i can just ask about the quality of teaching ? there 's been a consistent message from estyn that that is the weakest part of the system in wales . the government recognises that and has invested a very significant amount of money in that area , yet it 's still an issue again in your annual report . you have n't said whether it 's getting better or going in the right direction . what is your assessment of whether we are seeing the improvements we need to see in the quality of teaching ?",15,0.5,0.3606208562850952
1,0,"i think , in nearly all the elements of our framework , the picture is fairly similar . so , in terms of quality of teaching , we have seen gradual but quite small-scale improvements in primary . so , you can feel that that is going in the right direction . in secondary , it 's more or less level ; we have n't seen it getting particularly better or particularly worse . one of the things that 's really important to realise is that the curriculum is about the quality of teaching . it is about the teaching and learning ; those are two sides of the same coin , if you like . what 's important is the learning experience that our pupils get in school . from the perspective of the pupil , it 's the learning ; from the perspective of the teacher , it 's the teaching . they are two sides to the same coin . i think there 's no doubt and i think there 's general agreement that , in order to have a step change in the quality of teaching and learning— . i think it was einstein who said that if you keep on doing the same thing , you 'll get the same result . so , you 're going to have to change something , and what 's changing is the curriculum . i think there 's general consensus that this is the right approach to improve the quality of teaching . and that 's exactly what all schools need to do now : to think how does this new curriculum affect them in their particular school , in their particular circumstances , in the context of their particular children . how can they use this opportunity now to improve the teaching and learning in their school ?",15,0.5,0.5379997491836548

0,0,"it does cause one concern , because if the teaching and learning standards just stay the same in the secondary sector , and we know that 12 per cent of secondary schools are under estyn review and 11 per cent of them are in special measures , we 're talking about half of the schools almost , and no improvement in the teaching quality in general . so , there is a major cohort of children captured in that situation , and then there 's a new curriculum that comes in . i see the opportunities , but these schools that are doing well are going to go , 'wow , up there ' , but schools are there in the bottom layer and one is genuinely concerned about those children in those schools . is n't that where the focus should be and any additional funding that 's allocated ? you talked about releasing teachers for training , but perhaps it 's in those particular schools that we need to focus .",15,0.5,0.2770160734653473
0,0,"i do agree that the best schools will welcome the opportunities and that their standards will improve even more . but then , with regard to the other schools , in a way , there are two very broad categories , which are those that need only a little support just to help them to improve— . and i believe that the new curriculum and the general support that 's going to be surrounding that will be the solution for those schools . it 's going to be an opportunity for the quality of the teaching and the learning to improve . but you 're right to say that there is another smaller cohort that has a much greater need for support , and they 're going to find coping with the new curriculum difficult , because they 'll also have many other problems . so , i do agree— . and you 're not talking about a huge number of schools—some 200 secondary schools is what we have in wales , so that percentage is relatively small , the number is relatively small—but they need much greater support . that is why this pilot scheme of the multi-agency approach of supporting those schools is important . i do believe that you 're right to say that there are funding implications to supporting those schools . i do n't think it 's enormous , but certainly there 's a certain amount of funding that is needed to offer those schools that support .",15,0.5,0.3115217685699463

0,0,"if i can just go back to the last question as well , what we did in order to inspect regions was we paused our local authority inspection cycle back in 2014 , i think , for about three years . so , then , we spent time looking at regions , basically , because we did n't have the resource to do both at the same time . so , we 're in negotiation with welsh government currently , so that , going forward , we can look at local authorities and regions at the same time . if regions become statutory entities , that would be in legislation , and then you could have legislation that gives us directly the powers to inspect them , which we do n't currently have . so , we have to , effectively , wait for welsh government to ask us to do that work . but , as jassa said , currently , what we intend to do in the short is to do some thematic work on that . in terms of erw , they were the region that , at the end of the last cycle of regional inspections , we were still monitoring . we are concerned about their progress , particularly in the light of recent developments . so , for example , the chair of the joint committee has resigned , the managing director remains a temporary appointment and there are no clear plans for a permanent leadership . some of the leadership team have left—the capacity has gone down—and various staff that were appointed last summer have already left . the budget has not been agreed and certain key meetings—executive board and joint committee meetings—have been cancelled . so , we are particularly worried about erw , and , because of that , we will be going in to visit them in april—next month—and we 'll be visiting all of the authorities to make sure that they do have a plan for an appropriate school improvement service going forward . but , jassa , probably , can say a little bit more about our plans there .",15,0.5,0.45495039224624634
0,0,"yes , i think you asked a specific question about , you know , which is better . i think our view has been that , generally , the local authorities are too small to deliver that whole range of school improvement services , particularly given the national reform agenda at the moment . we felt last summer , when we went to erw , that they 'd managed to reach the best possible model , given the constraint they 've placed , collectively , on themselves—that they want to deliver aspects of school improvement locally , through the local authorities , and have some central capacity . so , we felt that , given that they wanted to do some locally and some centrally , enough thought had been put into that structure last summer and that it could be workable . there were key aspects such as support for secondary schools causing concern and there was some capacity centrally that could support areas such as powys . unfortunately , as meilyr has described , some of those aspects have since been disbanded or those staff who were on secondment have gone back , so i think it is a key risk , particularly for some of those authorities you 've talked about that are causing concern , such as powys or pembrokeshire—that they have n't necessarily got that local capacity to support their schools causing concern . so , you 've got some concerns within school capacity and you 've got concerns about local authority capacity , and what you do n't have there now is that collective capacity centrally that might support them . so , that 's why we 're going to go and do a slightly more detailed link visit to try to understand how they are mitigating the risks that we see are arising as a result of some of those things that have happened recently . our understanding is that there 's a joint committee meeting of erw on 19 march , so , hopefully , after that point , we 'll have a little bit more information about how they 're planning to manage that collective set of services going forward—it 's a little bit of an unknown at the moment .",15,0.5,0.37860938906669617

0,0,"as you 're aware , the number of colleges from 22 to 12 , and i think those mergers resulted in establishments that were stronger in terms of their leadership in particular . that leadership , i think the characteristics we have seen in the 'good ' or 'better'—as you say , 80 per cent leadership good or better—has been a culture of openness , a culture of clarity of purpose about where the college is going . high staff morale has been maintained , because a number of those colleges— . obviously , if you 're merging large colleges as they did in north wales , keeping staff morale high is quite a skill , and i think the leadership have done that very well . they 've also supported managers at all levels , and they 've encouraged managers to support staff at all levels . so , it 's become a very collaborative , very supportive organisation . i think another characteristic of the fe sector is that it 's got very strong governance arrangements . i did a training session for college governors about a month ago , and what struck me was the breadth of experience of the college governors , from industry , from academia . they are a very challenging set of governors , i think , who hold the senior leadership to account in the colleges , and that helps to push standards forward . teaching is 'good ' or 'better ' in 70 per cent of colleges because the senior leadership team are encouraging teachers in colleges to innovate , encouraging them to engage actively in performance management systems , and to become reflective practitioners in the colleges . and this is impacting , obviously , on the standards at the end of the day . so , i think those are the key features .",15,0.5,0.4161013066768646

0,0,"yes , thank you . we had evidence last week from some of the higher education institutions , including cardiff university , and it 's very interesting , in relation to erasmus+ and the mobility funding for students that , i think , only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in cardiff is paid for by erasmus+ . i note that you 've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator . i was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that .",15,0.5,0.4090679883956909
0,0,"again , reflecting on the latest fee and access plans , seven of the universities are referring to mobility—either they have targets in them or are explaining what their plans are—so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income . however , erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan—if we were looking at a scenario where that infrastructure was n't available , to implement anything similar to that would be much less efficient and much more costly . and to enable an infrastructure that allowed— . ideally , you 'd want something that all welsh institutions could take part in , and that takes some investment and some co-ordinating . and , equally , you need to have the arrangements with your overseas and european institutions . i think it 's easy to underestimate the accumulation of time that has gone into establishing erasmus . so , i think replacing it would be a challenge .",15,0.5,0.45769932866096497

0,1,"bore da . i just want to start by asking some questions around the targeting of the pupil development grant because , clearly , we 've had a lot of evidence around this apparent blurring of eligibility to an extent . i 'm just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because , clearly , it 's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals , from some of the evidence we 've had , but also that it seems to be predominantly focused on low-attaining frees—pupils who are eligible for free school meals .",15,0.5,0.3601800501346588
0,0,"thank you , llyr . i think it 's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions , those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals . but in some cases , schools may use their pdg funding to provide a universal intervention , but we would want to—in challenge advisers ' discussions in schools—we 'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals . so , for instance , if i give you an example in your own region , llyr : at brynteg county primary school in wrexham , if you look at that primary school in wrexham , their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts . so , there is no differentiation in those results . one of the things that they 've used their pdg for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school . so , that 's a universal thing that they 've trained all the teachers in , but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals . so , if you 're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset , it 's about really challenging learners to think that , ' i can do things . if sometimes i fail , i pick myself up , i 'm more resilient . ' now , that has been , as i said , trained to all the teachers in the school—it 's an ethos for the whole school—but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater , and now they 're at the same level . so , that 's the important distinction . individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals , but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff , for instance , and that , then , has to demonstrate it has a disproportionate effect on free school meals . so , growth mindset ; it may be attachment disorder training for staff , for instance , where we know it 's of benefit to everybody , but will have particular benefits for that cohort of students . with regard to more able and talented , you know , llyr , that this is an area of concern for me , generally , within the welsh education system ; that we 've not been particularly good at identifying , supporting and driving attainment for those children . i 'm absolutely clear that pdg needs to be used for those children who are eligible to drive potential , whatever the potential of that child is , including more able and talented . and again , i 'll give you an example that has been seen as good practice in pembrokeshire : a window on the world bus , again paid for by schools . i do n't know if you 're aware of it .",15,0.5,0.45705118775367737

0,0,"i 'll pick up on that as well . just to explain how we work with independent schools , initially , to give the context . so , there are different kinds of independent schools . so , some have boarding provision , and where they have boarding provision , care inspectorate wales would look at the boarding side of it , we 'd look at the educational side of it . there are others where they may have a linked children 's home , which can be another room in the same house , or it can be a number of miles away , and similarly there ciw would look at the residential aspects of the care and we 'd look at the school . so , i think , there 's a focus in the independent school standards regulations , which is a minimum that all schools have to meet to maintain a registration . there is a focus in that on how that school looks after and cares for its pupils , and there are focuses on that element of boarding provision where relevant , and the national minimum standards that the care inspectorate look at that have aspects around supporting well-being as well . what we do find in our inspections is that , overall , we generally find that pupils ' well-being develops , they make good progress , and that care , support and guidance that schools give is good . what we mean by that , really , practically , is that they are developing their resilience and their self-esteem . in special schools , this might mean particularly that those pupils learn to manage their anxieties better so that they improve their behaviour , which may be one of the reasons why they 're in that specialist setting . in mainstream independent schools , what we find is that people develop their tenacity , their curiosity for learning—their resilience in that way . but there are shortcomings sometimes . for example , there was one school where we found that they were n't making appropriate referrals to child and adolescent mental health services . so , these schools do operate independently by their nature , and their awareness , perhaps , of some of the guidance and support that is out there—sometimes , maybe , there can be more to be done , and i think we 've talked to welsh government about that .",15,0.5,0.3567083179950714

0,1,"well , that 's straight into what i was going to ask , really , about what you think the factors are that led to this 8 per cent or 9 per cent drop in eu students applying to study in wales , where we see a 2 per cent increase in england . is that it , or are there other things that you 've taken into account ? what 's your assessment of the reasons behind this ?",15,0.5,0.42236602306365967
0,0,"it 's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons , but i think there are probably two . the one that bethan has already indicated , which is the change in student support arrangements for eu students , will have an effect of perturbation . that 's probably relatively temporary—let 's hope it is—as that settles down because , actually , the deal for eu students coming into wales is no worse than that coming into england . ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower , but we do struggle in wales in terms of the anglocentric nature of the media and so on . so , getting the messages out is a challenge . the other dimension is that when you 're in a highly competitive recruitment market , you have to do what you can to look attractive . part of that is about being able to invest in facilities , and particularly buildings and kit , and the relative levels of investment between wales and england over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that . certainly , anecdotally i know , from my own family , that a lot of the choices have been made in terms of the state of repair of campuses and so on . there 's something rational about that , is n't there ? if you 've got a system that is relatively better invested , then you 're likely to have a better student experience because the resources are likely to be better . so , that 's not irrational . we saw a sort of similar but opposite effect when the £9,000 fee maximum limit came in , and some institutions , mostly in england—there was one in wales—chose to pitch their fee levels really quite low , relative to that £9,000 , and caught a cold in the student recruitment market because fee levels denote quality in the student mind . so , the price sensitivities work quite differently . so , again , if you 've got a relatively better invested part of the system , then that might well be one of the reasons why it looks more attractive .",15,0.5,0.36569899320602417

0,0,and what are the universities expecting ? what do they anticipate ?,15,0.5,0.3022341728210449
0,0,"well , for 2017-18 , which is the year we 're about to end now , they were expecting £38 million income from european students , and approximately £91 million from the various european programme funding sources , and that 's about 8 per cent of the total income—£1.5 billion—of the sector . the forecasts are assuming that that continues , albeit that institutions have various scenarios that they have for all sorts of scenarios that we can all speculate on , and , as i mentioned earlier , the balancing act of maintaining infrastructure and resources and staff in the short term is where we are at the moment , or where the sector is at the moment . and there are also signs that the banks and lending institutions are becoming a bit more risk-averse in providing borrowing to institutions , and of more differentiation between individual institutions being made than has possibly been the case in the past . the sector made an operating deficit , again looking at all welsh institutions collectively last year , 2016-17 , of £17 million . that 's before other gains and losses . and we 're expecting a similar collective level of deficit for this financial year , if not slightly higher . now , these are managed deficits and we are not currently seeing critical short-term cash availability issues in the sector . however , the increase in funding from diamond is a key part of enabling the sector to return to longer-term financial sustainability . short-term challenges can be met if there 's a reasonable prospect of future funding . you can manage in the short-term , but there comes a point when the big cost reductions and infrastructure reductions have to be made . and , again , having mentioned the pressures on pay , pensions and other challenges , it is difficult to gauge whether , if those factors come into play as well , some of these cost reductions may have to be made before funding comes in to replace—either diamond funding or the european replacement funding .",15,0.5,0.3301759362220764
0,0,"so , would it be fair to say that , in terms of the funding arrangements , and , in terms of the student numbers , one reason why we 've got this recruitment problem is this lack of investment in the capital infrastructure that we've seen in recent years because of the financing arrangements from the welsh government , and the fee regime that we had previously , and the student finance regime that we had previously , not getting more cash into our welsh universities perhaps , and that , over the next few years , there 's going to have to be much more significant investment in capital if we 're to raise the game and be more competitive , yes ?",15,0.5,0.47616681456565857
0,0,"yes , that would be fair to say .",15,0.5,0.33877891302108765
0,0,"so , to what extent are they planning for more capital investment in those financial strategies that they 've been preparing and presenting to you ?",15,0.5,0.32422900199890137
0,0,"they are all planning for capital investment . they are in different positions in terms of capacity to borrow and the assumptions . this year , 2018-19 , is the first time that we 've had capital funding in our remit letter—so , we 've got £10 million of capital funding , which is very welcome , with a prospect of a further £20 million . so , that we will be allocating shortly . that will make a difference , particularly to those institutions who are not finding it as easy to borrow from financial institutions . some of our larger institutions have borrowed—cardiff university issued a bond . however , there are internal governance processes that are putting tight restrictions and expectations of what that money will be invested in . but they all have plans to do it and they need the confidence that their forecasts and long-term future funding prospects are secure enough that they can get the confidence of borrowers then , and service the costs of those borrowers .",15,0.5,0.4538140892982483
0,0,"so , the diamond dividend you 've mentioned a few times . what clarity is there from the welsh government at the moment in terms of how much they anticipate the diamond dividend will be , and what proportion of that is going to be released to heis in the future ?",15,0.5,0.2999636232852936
0,0,"i was very carefully not describing it as a dividend—a re-establishing of funding that we had in the past for higher cost and innovation and maintaining research funding . the timescales are difficult , because we have an annual remit letter , and we can work with welsh government officials , and they can only give us a sense of when they think the funding will be released . but 2018-19 is the start of the system , and because of cohort protection—so , protecting those students who came in on a different deal to the deal from 2018-19—in the early years there is an element of double cost ; there 's a cost of seeing out the old system and the different cost of implementing the new system . so , at the moment , we 're certainly not in a position to tell the sector with any degree of certainty what funding would be beyond what we 've allocated for 2018-19 , with some sense of what 2019-20 numbers we 're working with because we allocate our money over an academic year—so , by definition , we 've already made assumptions of four months of the 2019-20 funding , albeit that 's not approved yet in the budgetary process .",15,0.5,0.3717692196369171

0,0,"i think it 's fair to say that officials have been as helpful as they can be with us , in terms of the planning assumptions we make and indications about whether or not we are being too ambitious or not ambitious enough . so , i think they 're being very helpful ; as bethan said , they 're constrained by the process—they ca n't pre-empt a budget process . and you folks will be fully aware of that , of course . the other question i think you asked was how much of the money released by the new arrangements will come into higher education . at the moment , we are expecting all of it to come into higher education , as the product of the arrangement between the current cabinet secretary and the current first minister . the extent to which any changes there cause that to come under threat is something i ca n't judge at the moment . but we have had in our remit letter from the cabinet secretary a clear indication that we can expect our resource to grow over the next few years , as the diamond process unfolds .",15,0.5,0.41269561648368835

0,0,"can i just ask , in terms of the impact of brexit , have you done any assessment of what you think might happen , or have any of the institutions made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions , going forward ? you 've mentioned scenarios earlier on , david , so what scenarios have you set out ?",15,0.5,0.3339318633079529
0,0,"there 's a welsh government he brexit working group , which is chaired by one of the government directors , and we sit on that . and we have provided that group with early summaries of the risks and the potential impact , in terms of the exposure of the sector to eu-sourced funding . we have , as part of that working group , explored those issues that it would be really very helpful for either the welsh government to try to put in place or for the welsh government to persuade uk government to do . and i think , in our submission , we identified a number of areas of what we would consider to be a helpful action , and that has been worked through that working group . we know that it has informed welsh government 's position , in terms of what it does and also in terms of the conversations that they have with her majesty 's government . beyond that , what we have n't done in that working group is share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would respond to different scenarios . we are not able to do that here either because , inevitably , they would have varying degrees of unpalatability and they would have to be managed very , very carefully . you take cost out , which is essentially the response , you actually take people's jobs out , and all of that has to be managed carefully . so , that 's not really a matter for public consideration , but we do know that the institutions are looking at a range of scenarios on what they would do . bethan mentioned earlier on that the current deficit for the sector is a managed deficit—it 's not something that has taken them by surprise . they are responding to what they see as the dip between where diamond was reporting and where the money starts flowing . similarly , i think we 're comfortable that there is a managed approach to the scenarios that they 're testing within institutions . so , they will do what they need to do to sustain themselves . the bigger issue really , in a public policy context , is the potential damage for the sector to be able to deliver for wales in terms of research and skills development and all the other contributions .",15,0.5,0.33374372124671936

0,0,"okay . can i just ask about fee and access plans , and how brexit might impact them ? to what extent do you think that they could be impacted ?",15,0.5,0.41386157274246216
0,0,"i think there are two dimensions to maybe touch upon there . fee and access plans are approved annually by us . they are approved in advance of the recruitment cycle for the year that they apply to . so , we 're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year . so , there 's quite a long lead time . we , as part of that process , go through similar—we look at their financial sustainability , which is based on their forecasts—data to the stuff we 've just been discussing . and also , of course , the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types , from different domains , are going to be recruited . so , clearly , if there is a continuing downward pressure on eu student recruitment , then that will reduce the amount of fee income that 's going to come in , unless they can find other students , and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans . in terms of process , we have two things that we can do . if institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they 've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality , then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan . so , we have a change process . if it 's not fundamentally different , but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later— . we also monitor after the event and , if there are differences , we would then obviously require institutions to explain those differences . if they 've had fewer students and less investment , we would need to understand that . conversely , if they 'd had more students , and potentially more investment , we 'd want to know what they 'd spent it on , and if they 've done different things , we 'd want to understand that as well . so , we do challenge through a monitoring process . the only other thing that 's perhaps worth saying is that , in the 2019-20 fee and access plans—they 're not published yet , so i ca n't give you the full detail—five universities have made reference to brexit and the brexit impact , and things they want to do through their fee and access plan to try and address some of those issues , so they 're in there as well .",15,0.5,0.441069632768631
0,0,"but we 've already said , have n't we , that it may be nothing to do with brexit , this dip in eu recruitment , because there are other factors like the attractiveness of the estates and the environment that young people might be educated in ? but they 're making assumptions that it 's linked to brexit , are they ?",15,0.5,0.4029132127761841
1,0,"not really . i think they 're making assumptions that it could be . there are things they want to do to enhance and to protect student mobility , and some of that will be funded through fee plan investment . so , the brexit conversation between the eu and the uk government might or might not sustain erasmus engagement , and if it does n't , then they need to find other ways of trying to support that sort of thing . so , that 's what we 're beginning to see in the fee plans . it 's them thinking about how else we can do this stuff .",15,0.5,0.5527830719947815

0,0,"shall i start ? so , qualifications wales is the regulator of the awarding bodies , so we regulate awarding bodies . our powers are structured around the regulating of awarding bodies . we do n't regulate commercial publishers nor the provision of textbooks within that . in regulating the awarding body , our primary focus is also on the design of the qualifications and then the delivery of the assessment . so , it 's much more around the assessment side than teaching resources . that said , when we are going through the design of the qualifications , we go through an approval process , so we develop approval criteria and we ask wjec to submit their specifications against those approval criteria and sample assessment materials as well . so , our focus is very much on making sure that teachers are able , through the sample assessment materials and the specifications , to have a good understanding of what is going to be expected of them in the examinations and of their pupils in the examinations . so , that 's setting out the knowledge , skills and understandings that will be assessed by wjec when those exams are sat . we have in the past pulled together groups of people to look at issues like resources . so , during the last round of approvals , we pulled together interested parties in welsh government , regional consortia and wjec to look at resources that would be available with a view to facilitating the discussion about who would be best placed to fill the gaps where there may be perceived to be gaps in resources . our other primary role is in maintaining standards . so , as the regulator of qualifications , what we want to do is we want to make that the awards of qualifications—so , the grades that people get—are fair . one of the things we do is set out the way in which the awarding bodies will set grades—so , the awarding process , the methods that will be used—and then we monitor wjec's award of grades against those processes . during a period of change , we prescribe the use of comparable outcomes as the primary approach , largely because comparable outcomes are designed for circumstances like this , where there 's a change in a specification particularly , because there are any number of reasons , including resources , why performance may be different from one year to the next , but comparable outcomes is there to ensure that , all things being equal , if the cohorts have the same ability , the same grade should be awarded from one year to the next . we do recognise that there have been delays in textbooks . much of that has been related to the timelines that we 've all had to deliver new specifications against , which have been far from ideal for everybody involved . we think that particularly our role moving forward will be looking at the timelines for reforms that will be necessary for the new curriculum to make sure that this situation is n't repeated and that there is sufficient time in future reforms to allow for greater system readiness . in terms of the roles of others , welsh government have a role at the moment in terms of grant funding of translation of materials into welsh medium . and there is , through the common model at the moment—and this is a model that is common between england and wales—a reliance on commercial publishers to provide textbooks . now , that 's something that probably needs to be looked at in the future in terms of potential different models for how that might be achieved and also , potentially , around a paradigm shift in what 's expected of those materials . so , i think that sets out qualification wales 's position in particular .",15,0.5,0.3798200488090515
