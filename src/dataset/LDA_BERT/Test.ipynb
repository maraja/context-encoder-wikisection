       " \"pubg review with the full game being released for around a month now i wanted to give a detailed review of the game and what still needs to change. gameplay 6/10 although a significantly polished version to the early access the gameplay still suffers from lag and stuttering issues. the main stutter the bad stutter making the game unplayable has been cleared however when on the starting area and when on the plane it suffers serverly from frame drops to around half what you would normally get. it also seems to have a problem staying at a constant fps from a long period of time i was stood still in a game to test this and still had frame drops of about 4 15 fps although some may not see this difference when you play 60fps it becomes frustrating. despite this playing is still fun and very competive whether playing solo or with friends. the progression of the circle isn't too random or unfair to players and the weapons are balanced in both drop rates based on it's effect on a game and against other weapons. one thing that was rather odd was the random ammo in houses i understand why this drop exists but when you find a house non looted full of ammo only it can become rather annoying. overall good but still needs some improvement. graphics 9/10 this games graphics can only be described through 1 word beautiful. it's graphics are a perfect balance of performance and asthetics although the aforementioned frame drops have meant some settings have been lowered. as i find with most games the shadows effect fps quite heavly although as i don't see a huge advantage of them in this game this can be lowered with no severe issues being had in the ways of gameplay. weirdly the effects made a big difference for me in the case of fps but when changing it no difference could be seen. the textures again weirdly didn't seem to have an effect on my fps like alot of other games do with them on very low and every thing else bar effects and shadows being on ultra i got 80 and with textures on ultra 60 70 was what i layed at. weird but very nice to people with lower end cards. great work on the graphics. mechanics 10/10 this the main part of the game which i truly felt was polished fully bar graphics and had the most work on. now don't get me wrong driving is broken in certain vehicles and terrain but i felt as if this made the game more enjoyable and actually made me play more messing around with the vehicles trying some stunts or running people over while trying not to flip the car on a pebble the game became more entertaing with this. the drops are balanced and not overly populated in random areas they also drop better weapons less frequently a huge plus in the way of a competive game. the circles progression is not aggressive to a point where it becomes impossible to actually stop for a moment to clear out an area while running from the oncoming circle a very well desgined feature. the parachuting is as expected working enough.  and amazingly the opening of doors is ordinary. add ons 7/10 now this one will be brief. the cases are not bad but at the same time not great. any microtransactions no matter what they do are good. you shouldn't have to pay to do anything in a game it should be able to earned however in pubg's defence you can earn the crates and open them or sell them for an item you want howevr the gamescons when they were avaliable for purchase or the desparado crate need keys which can not be earned which is a slap in the face if you earn them. however with the price of items being rather high on any item or than the basic tops or pants profit is significantly easier than csgo although i still advise no money is spent on crates or keys. overall 8/10\",\n",

       " 'alright first of all let me say this game is a classic and one many rpg players or gamers in general will never forget me included but does this remaster live up to the hype? yes and no. i cant really complain about wasting money because i got it for free alongside the other people with all the dlc i digress what i mean by no is the pc players specifically the modded players. i myself played around 430 hours of always 100+ mods and it was amazing i loved the game skyrim base and with mods the entire experience kicks off but any modded player will tell you skyrim just isnt as good without mods the graphics cant compare some followers e. g. sofia are far superior and much more. and i completely agree i would never play skyrim vanilla vs skyrim modded if i had the choice. and its just the vanilla vs modded experience is heavily one sided on the mod side so theres no point instantly upgrading unless yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods. but what i mean by yes in about 2 3 months if enbs are supported and the modders of skyrim port their mods into the new game as many are already itll be far better because of bethesda fixing some bugs and the new 64bit engine and the scripts.  so when everything gets updated and ported it should be a far superior experience compared to 2011 skyrim. overall i most likely wont be playing the game for a while at least until skse or skyui somehow is supported for the new game. but when those mods are ported and availible for the game? ill be playing like its 2011 again im really excited for the remastered mods but a remaster of the actual game? didnt need it wouldve been nicer to see a full new fresh remaster of oblivion or morrowind instead. so in conclusion theres no point instantly upgrading unless yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods. however if you just want to play the game without mods go ahead and play its just a better skyrim for you but if you want mods youre gonna have to wait until skse releases but when it does ill be playing it for sure alongside of many other people',\n",

       " \"pubg review with the full game being released for around a month now i wanted to give a detailed review of the game and what still needs to change. gameplay 6/10 although a significantly polished version to the early access the gameplay still suffers from lag and stuttering issues. the main stutter the bad stutter making the game unplayable has been cleared however when on the starting area and when on the plane it suffers serverly from frame drops to around half what you would normally get. it also seems to have a problem staying at a constant fps from a long period of time i was stood still in a game to test this and still had frame drops of about 4 15 fps although some may not see this difference when you play 60fps it becomes frustrating. despite this playing is still fun and very competive whether playing solo or with friends. the progression of the circle isn't too random or unfair to players and the weapons are balanced in both drop rates based on it's effect on a game and against other weapons. one thing that was rather odd was the random ammo in houses i understand why this drop exists but when you find a house non looted full of ammo only it can become rather annoying. overall good but still needs some improvement. graphics 9/10 this games graphics can only be described through 1 word beautiful. it's graphics are a perfect balance of performance and asthetics although the aforementioned frame drops have meant some settings have been lowered. as i find with most games the shadows effect fps quite heavly although as i don't see a huge advantage of them in this game this can be lowered with no severe issues being had in the ways of gameplay. weirdly the effects made a big difference for me in the case of fps but when changing it no difference could be seen. the textures again weirdly didn't seem to have an effect on my fps like alot of other games do with them on very low and every thing else bar effects and shadows being on ultra i got 80 and with textures on ultra 60 70 was what i layed at. weird but very nice to people with lower end cards. great work on the graphics. mechanics 10/10 this the main part of the game which i truly felt was polished fully bar graphics and had the most work on. now don't get me wrong driving is broken in certain vehicles and terrain but i felt as if this made the game more enjoyable and actually made me play more messing around with the vehicles trying some stunts or running people over while trying not to flip the car on a pebble the game became more entertaing with this. the drops are balanced and not overly populated in random areas they also drop better weapons less frequently a huge plus in the way of a competive game. the circles progression is not aggressive to a point where it becomes impossible to actually stop for a moment to clear out an area while running from the oncoming circle a very well desgined feature. the parachuting is as expected working enough.  and amazingly the opening of doors is ordinary. add ons 7/10 now this one will be brief. the cases are not bad but at the same time not great. any microtransactions no matter what they do are good. you shouldn't have to pay to do anything in a game it should be able to earned however in pubg's defence you can earn the crates and open them or sell them for an item you want howevr the gamescons when they were avaliable for purchase or the desparado crate need keys which can not be earned which is a slap in the face if you earn them. however with the price of items being rather high on any item or than the basic tops or pants profit is significantly easier than csgo although i still advise no money is spent on crates or keys. overall 8/10\",\n",
